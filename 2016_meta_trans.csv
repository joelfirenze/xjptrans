3,50,"[, November 22, on a state visit to the Republic of Chile, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Together Create a Better Future for China-Chile Relations"" in the Chilean Courier. The article is as follows: To jointly create a better future for the relationship between China and Chile, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, Chile is known as the ""land of the world"", surrounded by mountains and sea, beautiful scenery, rich products and splendid culture. The Chilean people are industrious and intelligent, relying on their own hands to carry forward the gritty national spirit and create a miracle of development. , 5 years ago, I visited Chile and left a good impression. Today, once again set foot on this beautiful land, feeling warm and full of expectations. , China and Chile are separated at both ends of the earth and are far apart, but the people of the two countries have a long history of exchanges, forming an indissoluble bond. Nobel Prize winner and Chilean poet Neruda affectionately called China ""the great brother"". Not only do China and Chile have brotherly country names, but the two peoples also have brotherly friendship. The people of China and Chile have a tradition of knowing each other. The people of the two countries face each other across the sea and appreciate each other. Neruda visited China many times and wrote poems that sing and bless China such as ""Song of China's Earth"" and ""Asian Wind"". His works are widely praised in China and have influenced many Chinese poets. The famous Chilean painter Vantu Leli has lived in China for many years. He drew on the techniques of Chinese ink painting, and created works such as ""The Yangtze River"", which is full of deep love for China. These poems and paintings reflect the profound friendship between the people of China and Chile. They established the first Sino-Latin American friendship organization for China-Chi-China Cultural Association, which led a group of people of insight to join the Sino-Chilean friendship cause. There is a ""Yangtze River Primary School"" in Santiago, which implies that the Sino-Chilean friendship is like the Yangtze River, and the waves are pushing forward. The people of China and Chile have a tradition of mutual help. In the 2010 rescue disaster in Chile, which attracted worldwide attention, Chinese machinery and equipment manufacturers actively participated and contributed to the rescue of 33 mines. In 2015, there was a severe flood in northern Chile, and China reached out to Chile for the first time. The vast numbers of overseas Chinese living in Chile also helped each other. The Chilean side actively rescued trapped Chinese citizens, reflecting the sincere feelings of the two peoples in common. The people of China and Chile have a tradition of daring to lead. Relations between the two countries have created many ""firsts."" 46 years ago, President Allende, with his extraordinary foresight and vision, first decided to establish diplomatic relations with New China in a South American country, opening a new chapter in Sino-Chilean relations. Chile is the first Latin American country to sign a bilateral agreement with China on China’s accession to the World Trade Organization, the first to recognize China’s full market economy status, and the first to sign a bilateral free trade agreement with China. Driven by free trade agreements, the bilateral trade volume reached 31.8 billion US dollars in 2015, nearly five times that of 10 years ago. China has become Chile's largest trading partner and the largest export destination for copper, cherries, blueberries, seafood, wine and other products. Chile has become China's third largest trading partner in Latin America. Not long ago, the China Construction Bank Chile Branch officially opened as the first RMB clearing bank in Latin America, adding a new ""first"" to China-Chile relations. Thanks to the joint efforts of successive governments of the two countries and all sectors of society, China-Chile relations have flourished and achieved fruitful results. , Chinese people call the good marriage ""Jinyuliangyuan"". The gold medal of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games was made with Chilean gold and Chinese jade. The medals symbolize the sympathy of the people of China and Chile. The reason why China-Chile relations can develop steadily for a long time is because the two sides insist on treating each other as equals, mutual respect and mutual trust, because the two sides adhere to complementary advantages, mutual benefit and win-win situation, and even more because the two sides insist on advancing with the times, pioneering and enterprising, and promoting bilateral relations To a new height. At present, the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, the world economic recovery is struggling, and global challenges are constantly increasing. Both China and Chile are at a critical stage of development and face similar opportunities and challenges. The Chinese people are working hard to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Chile is also striving forward on the road of reform and development. A common development mission connects us more closely. , Latin American friends often say, ""Lone travel fast, many travel far."" Through this visit, I look forward to in-depth exchanges with friends from all walks of life in Chile, to carry forward the fine traditions of Sino-Chilean relations, to plan a new blueprint for cooperation between the two countries, and to promote the two countries to join hands on the road of common development. -We must uphold mutual respect and lay a solid political foundation. The two sides should strengthen all-round exchanges and firmly support each other on the development path that suits their national conditions.We must uphold mutual respect and build a political foundation. The two sides should strengthen all-round exchanges, firmly support each other on the development path that suits their national conditions, and understand and support each other on issues that concern each other's core interests and major concerns. -We need to strengthen strategic integration and promote common development. Both sides should improve the construction of free trade zones, promote trade and investment facilitation, increase the level of mutual investment, deepen cooperation in the fields of mining, agriculture, infrastructure construction, communications, clean energy, scientific and technological innovation, and bring more well-being to the two peoples. , ——We want to expand cultural exchanges and consolidate traditional friendship. Chilean writer Mistral said, ""Friendship is mutual trust and lasts forever."" The two sides should come and go frequently to expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, sports, tourism and other fields, so that the friendship between the two peoples will be passed on. -We must strengthen strategic cooperation and safeguard common interests. Both China and Chile are important countries in the Pacific Rim. The two sides should strengthen communication and coordination within the multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations and APEC, accelerate the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, and add new impetus to the development of the world economy. At present, the challenges facing Latin American countries on the road of development have increased, but they are still a hot spot full of hope. As Neruda said, ""If we take a look at the map of the Americas and face up to the great weather,"" we will double our confidence in the future of Latin America. Chile is the gateway to Latin America and currently serves as the rotating presidency of the Latin American Pacific Union, playing an important role in regional affairs. China is willing to work with Chile to promote greater development of China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership and build a community of shared destiny. , ""The confidants in the sea and the neighbors are close to each other.""

4,51,"[, Dear President Kuchynski, Dear Colleagues,: Glad to be with you all in beautiful Lima and conspire for a plan for Asia-Pacific cooperation. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Kuchynski and the Peruvian government for their efforts in preparing for this meeting! We look forward to this meeting's contribution to advancing Asia-Pacific cooperation. At present, the world economy is still undergoing in-depth adjustment, the recovery momentum is insufficient, and the growth differentiation is intensifying. Economic globalization has encountered setbacks, international trade and investment have been sluggish, and protectionism has risen. The G20 Hangzhou Summit held in September painted a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive blueprint for world economic growth, exemplified the spirit of partnership to meet challenges and demonstrated determination to seek common development. Asia-Pacific is an important position in the world economy, which breeds infinite hope and also bears great responsibilities. APEC is a pioneer, leader, and pioneer in economic cooperation between Asia-Pacific and the world. It plays an important role in promoting the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the global economy. Facing the new situation and new challenges, we must take effective measures to give full play to the role of the Asia-Pacific engine and promote the development of an innovative, dynamic, joint and inclusive world economy. First, unswervingly lead the process of economic globalization. Economic globalization has entered a period of phased adjustment, and there are those who question and those who wander. It should be noted that economic globalization is in line with the requirements of the development of productive forces and the interests of all parties, which is the general trend. We must not stop because of temporary difficulties. In participating in the process of economic globalization, we must focus on integrating with our own development practices, solve problems of fairness and justice, and lead economic globalization to a more inclusive direction. We must use actions to declare to the world that the Asia-Pacific region remains unchanged in its determination and confidence in economic globalization. History shows that there is no way out for protectionism. Eight years ago, at the critical juncture of dealing with the international financial crisis, APEC leaders voiced a unanimous voice against protectionism in Lima. Two years ago, we applied seriously in Beijing and did not take new protectionist measures. At the critical juncture of current Asia-Pacific development, we must work together to promote a win-win situation, oppose all forms of protectionism, and inject positive energy into economic globalization. Second, unswervingly enhance the level of Asia-Pacific open economy. Openness is the driving force for Asia-Pacific economic growth. We must support the multilateral trading system, place trade promotion and investment liberalization and facilitation in a more prominent position, and reinvigorate trade and investment vitality. It is necessary to effectively deal with the fragmentation of regional trade agreements, advocate openness and inclusiveness, and prevent closed exclusion. , Two years ago, we started the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Zone process in Beijing. With the joint efforts of all parties, the successful completion of the collective strategy study this year marks a new stage in the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area. Building an Asia-Pacific free trade area is not an easy task and requires long-term efforts. We must use the spirit of a blueprint to the end and take more vigorous actions to build an Asia-Pacific free trade zone at an early date and push the open Asia-Pacific economic level to a new height. Thirdly, unswervingly resolve the bottleneck of regional interconnection. According to Chinese medicine, ""general is not painful, pain is not reasonable."" Interconnection has made the economic bloodline of the Asia-Pacific more smooth. We must thoroughly implement the 10-year blueprint for interconnection adopted by the Beijing Conference and take more collective and autonomous actions to promote infrastructure, regulations, and personnel exchanges and interconnection. We need to build an all-round, composite interconnected network to make Asia-Pacific a home for neighbors. China actively promotes the “Belt and Road” initiative and contributes to the Asia-Pacific interconnection through consultation, co-construction and sharing with regional partners. China is willing to strengthen the connection with the development strategies and cooperation initiatives of the relevant parties to achieve synergy. Fourth, unswervingly create a reform and innovation pattern. Reform and innovation is the only way to long-term prosperity. We must put reform and innovation in a prominent position, promote economic structural reform, and create momentum for the Asia-Pacific to lead the world economy. To seize the key issues and exert efforts with precision, we must implement the ""Service Industry Competitiveness Roadmap"", deepen service industry cooperation, and fill this long-term short board. We must seize the opportunities of a new round of technology and industrial revolution, and create new growth points such as the Internet and the digital economy, blue economy, and green economy. With the strong support of all members, the first APEC Urbanization High-level Forum was successfully held in Ningbo, China, in June of this year. The ""Ningbo Initiative"" was adopted, which pointed out the direction of a new type of urbanization in the Asia-Pacific region. , Colleagues! In the 25 years since China's accession to APEC, China has insisted on making Asia-Pacific a priority for opening up. As the Bogor target deadline of 2020 approaches, we should enhance cooperation foresight, build consensus, and step up planning for a more long-term cooperation vision. China is willing to work with all parties on the theme of development, expand opening up, promote regional economic integration and interconnection, and promote reform and innovationLong-term cooperation vision. China is willing to work with all parties on the theme of development, expand opening up, promote regional economic integration and interconnection, promote reform and innovation, and jointly draw a magnificent picture of Asia-Pacific cooperation. , Let us deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership, seek openness for a win-win situation, promote prosperity through integration, and continue to forge ahead and create a better future for Asia-Pacific development! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Lima, November 20th), ""People's Daily"" (November 22, 2016, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the first phase of the 24th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting,1618,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-11-22,"[, 尊敬的库琴斯基总统，, 各位同事：, 很高兴同大家相聚在美丽的利马，共谋亚太合作大计。首先，我谨对库琴斯基总统和秘鲁政府为筹备本次会议付出的努力，表示衷心感谢！我们期待这次会议为推进亚太合作作出贡献。, 当前，世界经济仍然在深度调整，复苏动力不足，增长分化加剧。经济全球化遇到波折，国际贸易和投资低迷，保护主义抬头。9月举行的二十国集团领导人杭州峰会描绘了强劲、可持续、平衡、包容的世界经济增长蓝图，体现了共迎挑战的伙伴关系精神，展现了谋求共同发展的决心。亚太是世界经济的重要阵地，孕育着无限希望，也承载着重大责任。亚太经合组织是亚太和全球经济合作的先行者、引领者、开拓者，对促进亚太区域和全球经济发展具有重要作用。面对新形势新挑战，我们要采取有力举措，发挥亚太引擎作用，推动发展创新、活力、联动、包容的世界经济。, 第一，坚定不移引领经济全球化进程。经济全球化进入阶段性调整期，质疑者有之，徘徊者有之。应该看到，经济全球化符合生产力发展要求，符合各方利益，是大势所趋。我们不能因为一时困难停下脚步，要在参与经济全球化进程中，注重同各自发展实践相结合，注重解决公平公正问题，引领经济全球化向更加包容普惠的方向发展。我们要用行动向世界宣示，亚太对经济全球化决心不变、信心不减。, 历史表明，搞保护主义是没有出路的。8年前，在应对国际金融危机的紧要关头，亚太经合组织领导人在利马发出反对保护主义的一致声音。两年前，我们在北京庄严重申，不采取新的保护主义措施。在当前亚太发展的关键当口，我们要携手合作、促进共赢，反对一切形式的保护主义，为经济全球化注入正能量。, 第二，坚定不移提升亚太开放型经济水平。开放是亚太经济增长的动力。我们要支持多边贸易体制，把促进贸易和投资自由化便利化放在更加突出的位置，重振贸易和投资活力。要有效应对区域贸易协定碎片化现象，倡导开放包容，防止封闭排他。, 两年前，我们在北京启动亚太自由贸易区进程。在各方共同努力下，今年集体战略研究顺利完成，标志着亚太自由贸易区建设步入新阶段。建成亚太自由贸易区并非易事，需要长期努力。我们要以一张蓝图干到底的精神，采取更加有力的行动，早日建成亚太自由贸易区，把开放型亚太经济水平推向新高度。, 第三，坚定不移破解区域互联互通瓶颈。中医讲，“通则不痛，痛则不通”。互联互通让亚太经济血脉更加通畅。我们要深入落实北京会议通过的10年期互联互通蓝图，采取更多集体和自主行动，促进基础设施、规章制度、人员交流互联互通。我们要构建全方位、复合型互联互通网络，让亚太成为携手比邻的家园。, 中方积极推进“一带一路”倡议，通过同区域伙伴共商、共建、共享，为亚太互联互通事业作贡献。中方愿加强同有关各方发展战略及合作倡议对接，实现协同效应。, 第四，坚定不移打造改革创新格局。改革创新是通往长久繁荣的必由之路。要把改革创新摆在突出位置，推进经济结构改革，为亚太引领世界经济创造动力。要抓住关键问题，精准发力，要实施《服务业竞争力路线图》，深化服务业合作，补齐这一长期短板。要抓住新一轮科技和产业革命的机遇，打造互联网和数字经济、蓝色经济、绿色经济等新增长点。, 在各成员大力支持下，亚太经合组织首届城镇化高层论坛于今年6月在中国宁波成功举行，通过了《宁波倡议》，为亚太新型城镇化道路指明了方向。, 各位同事！, 中国加入亚太经合组织25年来，坚持把亚太作为开放的优先方向。随着2020年茂物目标期限临近，我们应该增强合作前瞻性，凝聚共识，加紧规划更加长远的合作愿景。中国愿同各方一道，以发展为主题，扩大开放，促进区域经济一体化、互联互通，推进改革创新，共同绘制亚太合作的宏伟画卷。, 让我们深化亚太伙伴关系，以开放谋共赢，以融合促繁荣，不断开拓进取，共创亚太发展的美好未来！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社利马11月20日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年11月22日 02 版）, ]",习近平在亚太经合组织第二十四次领导人非正式会议第一阶段会议上的发言,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28886074
5,52,"[, On November 17, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Peru, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Commercial Daily of Peru entitled ""A Century of Developmental Dreams, A Co-Generation Cooperation Xinhua Chapter"". The article is as follows:, A Century of Development Dreams Together, Xinhua Chapter of Cooperative Development, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, At the invitation of President Kuchynski, I will come to Peru to attend the 24th APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting state visit. President Kuchynski visited China in September, and I paid a state visit to Peru in November. The heads of state of China and Peru will exchange visits within 2 months, which will send a positive signal that China and Peru will work together and seek common development under the new situation. . After an interval of 8 years, Peru has once again hosted the APEC meeting, making new important contributions to deepening Asia-Pacific cooperation. China fully supports Peru in holding the meeting and jointly promotes the meeting to achieve positive results. , In the 1990s, I visited Peru and left a good impression on me. Peru has magnificent mountains and rivers, and is endowed with abundant natural resources. The ""South American backbone"" Andes runs through the north and south, and the Amazon River is vast. It is a cornucopia of minerals, energy, forests, and biological resources. The Peruvian people are industrious and courageous, with profound historical and cultural heritage, the long and splendid Inca civilization, the ancient civilization treasures such as the Machu Picchu ruins and the Nazca paintings, and the yearning for the Andean folk songs such as ""Song of the Mountain Eagle"". favorite. China and Peru have traditional friendly relations, and exchanges between the two countries have a long history. As early as more than 400 years ago, the Chinese people did not fear the turbulent waves and opened up the maritime silk road across the Pacific Ocean. Since then, the two countries have been in constant flow. For more than a century, many Chinese have traveled to Peru to find a happy life in this hot spot. They worked hard together with the Peruvian people, made positive contributions to Peru's national construction, and became the first friendly messenger to spread Chinese culture in Peru. Today, Peruvians of Chinese descent account for nearly one-tenth of the total population of the country. The Peruvian people affectionately call the Chinese people ""hometowns"", indicating that the traditional friendship between the two countries has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples. This is our two countries. A common wealth. , Peru is one of the first Latin American countries to establish diplomatic relations with New China. In the 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two sides have adhered to mutual respect and treat each other as equals, firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns, and have accumulated deep political mutual trust. This laid an important cornerstone for the development of China-Peru relations. At present, the two countries have established a comprehensive strategic partnership, which is the highest level of positioning between China and Latin American countries and reflects the high level of political mutual trust between the two sides. Although the world economic situation has been ""cold and windy"" in recent years, the pragmatic cooperation between China and Peru has been ""springy."" The trade between the two countries maintained a momentum of growth. In 2015, the bilateral trade volume reached nearly US$15 billion, a record high. From January to August this year, bilateral trade increased by 9% year-on-year, of which Peru’s exports to China increased by 21.8%. For many years, China has been Peru’s largest trading partner, largest export market, and largest source of imports. Peru has become one of the Latin American countries that attract the most Chinese investment. More than 170 Chinese companies have invested in Peru, with a total investment of more than US$14 billion, creating tens of thousands of jobs for Peru, increasing government taxes, and effectively driving the local area. Economic growth. The cultural exchanges between China and Peru are very active, and the people of the two countries have a better relationship and a closer relationship. Exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the fields of culture, education, science and technology, health, media, think tanks, youth, and justice are increasing. More and more Peruvian people, especially young students, want to learn Chinese and understand Chinese culture. There are more than 4000 registered students in 4 Confucius Institutes in Peru. We welcome more Peruvians to take a walk and take a look at China. The Chinese people appreciate the Inca civilization and more and more Chinese people want to visit Peru for sightseeing. , China and Peru also maintain close communication and coordination in international and regional affairs to jointly safeguard the overall interests of developing countries. Whether on major international issues such as UN reform, climate change, and sustainable development, or on regional issues such as the promotion of Asia-Pacific cooperation, Latin American integration, and China-Latin America overall cooperation, our two countries always share the same or similar positions. Echo and support each other. , I think that the reason why China-Peru relations are developing vigorously and vigorously is the solid foundation of friendship between the two countries, the strong economic and trade complementarity and willingness to cooperate, and the success of the governments of both countries. The right choice for bilateral relations. At present, the Chinese people are working hard to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Peruvian people are also building a ""just, fair and united Peru"" for the 200th anniversary of independence in 2021. Make unremitting efforts. We dreamDreaming hard, the Peruvian people are making unremitting efforts to build a ""just, fair and united Peru"" on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of independence in 2021. Our dreams are the same and our hearts are connected. It is the right time to deepen all-round cooperation. , ——We must deepen political mutual trust and accompany each other on the way forward. Both sides should insist on viewing the relationship between the two countries from a strategic and long-term perspective, understand and support each other's core interests and major concerns, and ensure the long-term stable development of China-Peru relations. I have said many times, ""The shoes fit well, only I know."" China supports Peru in exploring a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to strengthen the exchange of governance experience with the Peruvian side and achieve greater achievements in the construction of their respective countries. -We will expand pragmatic cooperation and promote common development and prosperity. China and Peru are natural partners. They have a wide range of practical cooperation, large scale, and many achievements. They have established mechanisms for economic cooperation, strategic dialogue, and mixed economic and trade committees. Both sides should coordinate and advance the next stage of pragmatic cooperation by formulating and implementing a joint action plan between the two countries. China proposes to strengthen the cooperation in production capacity and investment between the two countries, and is willing to provide all the equipment and technology required for industrialization to the secret side, as well as provide personnel training and supporting financing to help Peru achieve diversified economic development and achieve a bumper harvest in the quality and benefits of bilateral cooperation. -We must strengthen mutual learning among civilizations and lay a solid foundation for public opinion on China-Peru relations. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date. We want to expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and technology, tourism, and provide more convenience for the people of the two countries to strengthen exchanges. China welcomes more Peruvian students to come to China to study, promote the youth of the two countries to strengthen exchanges, and let the traditional friendship between the two countries spread. -We must strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs and safeguard common interests. World lasting peace, sustainable development and progress are the common aspirations of mankind. China is willing to work closely with the Peruvian side to communicate and cooperate closely on major international and regional issues, jointly promote a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core, and contribute to building a community of shared future for mankind and a community of interests. The China-Peru friendly baton of history has been passed to us. Let us go forward hand in hand and work closely together to realize the dream of the people of the two countries in pursuit of a happy life and promote world peace, stability and prosperity!

This is the first visit of Chinese President to Ecuador since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ecuador. I came with the friendly friendship of the Chinese people and the good desire to develop relations between the two countries. I look forward to building a new bridge of friendship and cooperation between China and Ecuador. , Ecuador is the first stop of my trip to Latin America.

Chinese-funded enterprises and overseas Chinese in Ecuador stood side by side and held hands with the local people to jointly fight the earthquake and rescue the disaster, and wrote a new tribute to the friendship between China and Ecuador. , I am happy to learn that in this earthquake relief, Chinese companies provided equipment technology and were responsible for the construction of the Ecuadorian public safety service system that played an important role. As a command center, the Ecuadorian public safety service system efficiently processed a large amount of information and issued instructions in time, saving many lives and reducing the losses caused by disasters. As a sincere friend of Ecuador, we will actively participate in post-disaster reconstruction, help people in disaster areas rebuild their homes as soon as possible, and restore a quiet and beautiful life as soon as possible. Both China and Ecuador are developing countries with similar historical experiences and common goals. In the 36 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, we have understood each other, supported each other, and helped each other, and have accumulated profound political mutual trust and friendship. China firmly supports the Ecuadorian people in exploring a development path that suits their national conditions, supports Ecuador’s efforts to achieve economic diversification, and supports Ecuador’s active role in international and regional affairs. , China has always viewed and developed relations with Ecuador from a strategic and long-term perspective. In January 2015, together with President Correa, I announced the establishment of a strategic partnership between the two countries, and the political mutual trust and strategic cooperation between the two countries have gained new strong momentum. At present, the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in various fields has achieved fruitful results, showing an all-round, wide-area and large-scale characteristic. , The trade exchanges between the two countries have continued to develop rapidly, and China has become the third largest trading partner of Ecuador. In 2015, the bilateral trade volume reached US$4.1 billion, which has quadrupled in 10 years and still has great potential. Ecuador's bananas and prawns are of high quality and have entered the Chinese market. We hope to see more Ecuadorian specialty products and high value-added products exported to China to enrich the Chinese market. , The investment and financing cooperation between the two countries is growing rapidly, and Ecuador is one of the Latin American countries that attract the most investment and financing from China. China’s various investments and financing in Ecuador have exceeded US$10 billion, supporting hundreds of projects including the Kocakodo-Sinclair Hydropower Station, including 8 large-scale infrastructure projects such as 8 hydropower stations and more than 10 highways. After these projects are completed, Ecuador's development will have a powerful locomotive and engine. We thank Ecuador for its trust in Chinese enterprises, Chinese equipment, and Chinese technology. The cultural exchanges between the two countries are splendid, and the exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the fields of culture, education, health, sports, and justice are increasing. The cultural performances and cultural exhibitions held by the two countries in the other country vividly display the essence of their own culture and resonate with the local people. More and more Chinese people want to travel to Ecuador. , High-tech cooperation is a highlight of the cooperation between our two countries. In 2013, the ""Pegasus"" satellite of Ecuador was successfully launched by a Chinese rocket. China is sincerely happy to help Ecuador realize the satellite dream. China's development experience tells us that science and technology are the primary productive forces. China understands Ecuador’s efforts to rejuvenate the country through science and technology, and supports it with practical actions. It has sent 8 scientists to participate in the Ecuadorian “Prometheus” talent introduction program, opened a joint laboratory in the Yachai Smart City, and hosted two countries in Ecuador. Meetings of the Mixed Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, China-Latin America and Caribbean Community Community Science and Technology Innovation Forum, etc. , Sino-Ecuadorian friendship also reflectsHeld a meeting of the Mixed Commission on Science and Technology Cooperation between the two countries, the China-Latin America and Caribbean Community Community Science and Technology Innovation Forum, etc. The friendship between China and Ecuador is also reflected in the fruitful multilateral cooperation between the two sides. China appreciates Ecuador's adherence to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, its courage to defend power and its courage to uphold justice. China is satisfied with the cooperation between China and Ecuador on major international issues such as United Nations reform, climate change, and sustainable development, and appreciates Ecuador’s active promotion of China-Latin America during its rotating presidency of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Forum building and overall cooperation between China and Latin America. At present, China-Ecuador relations enjoy solid political mutual trust, deep integration of interests, and broad space for cooperation. The strategic partnership between the two countries has favorable conditions for comprehensive development. I am willing to have in-depth exchanges with President Correa and friends from all walks of life in Ecuador during this visit to push China-Ecuador relations to a new level. , ——We want to be a good partner of sincerity and mutual trust. Both sides should insist on viewing and promoting the development of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, firmly grasp the correct direction of progress, and ensure the long-term stable and healthy development of Sino-Ecuadorian relations. When it comes to issues related to each other’s core interests and major concerns, the two sides must understand and firmly support each other and defend their independent right to development. , ——We must be good partners for common development. Development is the last word. China is implementing the ""13th Five-Year"" development plan, and Ecuador is also actively promoting the national development plan for 2013-2017. We must closely integrate our respective development strategies, achieve close integration of the industrial chain, and promote pragmatic cooperation to a higher level, a wider field, and a deeper level of development. China is willing to actively cooperate with Ecuador in production capacity, increase technology transfer to Ecuador, and help Ecuador improve its capacity for independent development. , ——We are to be good partners for generations of friendship. Both China and Ecuador have excellent civilized traditions. We should take the opportunity of facilitating personnel exchanges between the two countries to expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, health, sports, tourism, media, and justice, and consolidate the foundation of public opinion. The future belongs to young people. We should pay attention to promoting exchanges between the youths of the two countries, and foster successors for China-Ecuador friendship for generations. -We will be good partners in South-South cooperation. At present, the world situation is undergoing profound and complex changes. The vast number of developing countries, including China and Ecuador, should strengthen cooperation and jointly meet the challenges. China congratulates Ecuador on being the chairman of the Group of 77 in 2017. Both sides should maintain close communication and cooperation, coordinate and unify their positions on major international and regional issues, and jointly safeguard the interests of the vast number of developing countries. At the same time, we are also willing to work with Ecuador and other Latin American countries to continue to promote the construction of the China-Latin America Forum and continuously expand the overall cooperation between China and Latin America. , ""Brothers are one heart and their profits are determined."" Under the new situation, China is willing to work together with Ecuador to build a solid bridge that facilitates friendly exchanges between the two peoples and push China-Ecuador relations to a higher level.

7,54,"[, Dear Prime Minister Modi, Dear President Zuma, Dear President Temer, Dear President Putin, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Nice to come to beautiful Goa. Thank you Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government for their careful organization and thoughtful arrangements for this meeting. In 2014, I visited India. The hard-working Indian people and the magnificent and colorful Indian culture left a deep impression on me. October is the harvest season, and this year also coincides with the 10th anniversary of BRICS cooperation. ""Ten years to grind a sword."" The BRICS countries have worked hard for 10 years and harvested for 10 years. The BRICS countries have taken one step at a time, and their cooperation has continued to deepen and become more solid. They have developed into an international mechanism with important influence and achieved fruitful results. , ——This is the 10 years of seeking common development and moving forward. We have adhered to the priority of development, concentrated our energy on economic development and improving people's livelihood, and have made outstanding achievements. In the past 10 years, the proportion of the total economic volume of the five countries in the world economy has increased from 12% to 23%, the proportion of total trade has increased from 11% to 16%, the proportion of foreign investment has increased from 7% to 12%, and the quality of life of 3 billion people With the continuous improvement, the status and role of the BRICS countries in the international arena are constantly improving. -This is the 10 years of expanding cooperation and mutual benefit. We uphold the BRICS spirit of openness, tolerance, cooperation and win-win, and strive to build an all-round and multi-level cooperation structure. The cooperation field is constantly expanding, the cooperation mechanism is constantly improving, and the cooperation results are constantly emerging. We set up a new development bank and established emergency reserve arrangements to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency cooperation, strengthen the coordination of climate change positions, highlight the action and effectiveness of BRICS cooperation, and open up a new path for South-South cooperation. , ——This is 10 years of daring to act and make a difference. We work together to deal with the impact of the international financial crisis and make important contributions to the promotion of global economic and financial stability. The International Monetary Fund report pointed out that in the past 10 years, the BRICS countries have contributed more than 50% to world economic growth. We uphold international fairness and justice, and make joint voices and statements on important international and regional issues. We actively promote the process of global economic governance reform, which greatly enhances the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. , Colleagues! , ""The mirror is so good, the ancient things are known to the present."" We look back to the past to create glory. At present, the recovery momentum of the world economy is still fragile, global trade and investment are sluggish, commodity prices continue to fluctuate, and the deep-seated contradictions that triggered the international financial crisis are far from being resolved. In some countries, policies tend to be more internalized, protectionism is on the rise, and the trend of ""counter-globalization"" is surging. Geopolitical factors are complex, traditional and non-traditional security risks are intertwined, and global challenges such as terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change are more prominent. The development of BRICS countries faces a complex and severe external environment. The theme of this meeting of leaders is ""Building effective, inclusive and common solutions"", which is very targeted. In the face of the challenges posed by the international environment, we must have firm confidence and face them together. After 10 years of development, cooperation among the BRICS countries has become lush and has deep roots. We are fully capable of turning challenges into opportunities and pressure into motivation, working together to overcome difficulties. We must contribute the wisdom and strength of the BRICS countries and work together to find a way to deal with it. , First, build an open world together. Openness is the fundamental way to achieve prosperity and prosperity for the country. We must follow the objective laws of historical development, conform to the current development trend of the times, advance structural reforms, innovate growth methods, build an open economy, and clearly oppose all forms of protectionism. We must strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, take the promotion of large economic and trade markets, financial circulation, infrastructure connectivity, and cultural exchanges as the starting point, move to the forefront of international open cooperation, and actively play a leading role on the international stage. , Second, jointly develop a vision for development. Achieving inclusive and sustainable development is not only the common aspiration of people of all countries, but also the source of power for the sustained and stable growth of the world economy. We must continue to hold high the banner of development, combine the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the results of the G20 Hangzhou Summit, strengthen North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation, and inject new impetus into international development cooperation with new ideas, new ideas and new measures , Open up new space and promote the global economy to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. , Third, jointly address global challenges. The BRICS countries share the same breath and share the same destiny, which is not only a community of closely related interests, but also a community of actions that go hand in hand. We must strengthen coordination and communication on major international issues and regional hotspots, work together, promote political solutions to hotspot issues, and work together to deal with naturebody. We must strengthen coordination and communication on major international issues and regional hotspots, work together to promote political solutions to hotspot issues, and work together to address global issues such as natural disasters, climate change, infectious diseases, and terrorism. It is necessary to make a joint voice, advocate for the international community to increase investment, and take pragmatic actions to promote the resolution of practical problems, pay attention to both the symptoms and root causes, and comprehensive measures, resolve conflicts at the root, and contribute to the realization of long-term stability in the international community. , Fourth, jointly uphold fairness and justice. Fair and just global governance is a necessary condition for the common development of all countries. We must continue to be participants, promoters, and leaders of the global governance reform process, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and continue to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. We must continue to be defenders of the cause of international peace, adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principles of international relations, deal with issues in accordance with the merits of the matter itself, release positive energy, and promote the establishment of a new type of international relations of cooperation and win-win. , Fifth, jointly deepen partnership. The BRICS countries are good friends, brothers, and partners who treat each other sincerely, and this friendship and cooperation will continue to deepen. We should take the opportunity of implementing the ""BRICS Economic Partnership Strategy"" to deepen and expand economic cooperation in various fields and enhance the overall competitiveness of the BRICS countries. We must build, maintain, and develop the two mechanisms of the BRICS New Development Bank and emergency reserve arrangements to provide a strong guarantee for the economic development of developing countries. We need to strengthen people-to-people exchanges, promote people-to-people exchanges, and consolidate the foundation of public opinion for BRICS cooperation. We must continue to expand and consolidate the BRIC ""friendship"", maintain openness and tolerance, and seek common development. , Colleagues! China is a staunch supporter and participant of the BRICS mechanism, and regards BRICS cooperation as an important direction of China's diplomacy. I believe that BRICS cooperation will promote world peace, stability and prosperity. Next year, China will take over the rotating presidency of the BRICS countries and host the ninth meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries. We feel a heavy responsibility and confidence. We will work with member states to work together to plan a new blueprint for BRICS development. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Goa, October 16, India), ""People's Daily"" (October 17, 2016, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the eighth meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries,2206,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-10-17,"[, 尊敬的莫迪总理，, 尊敬的祖马总统，, 尊敬的特梅尔总统，, 尊敬的普京总统，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴来到美丽的果阿。感谢莫迪总理和印度政府为本次会晤所作的精心组织和周到安排。2014年，我访问过印度，勤勉奋进的印度人民、瑰丽多彩的印度文化给我留下深刻印象。, 金秋十月是收获的季节，今年也恰逢金砖国家合作10周年。“十年磨一剑。”金砖国家10年耕耘，10年收获。金砖国家一步一个脚印，合作不断走深走实，发展为具有重要影响的国际机制，取得了丰硕成果。, ——这是共谋发展、不断前行的10年。我们坚持发展优先，集中精力发展经济、改善民生，取得了突出成就。10年来，五国经济总量在世界经济中的比重从12%上升到23%，贸易总额比重从11%上升到16%，对外投资比重从7%上升到12%，30亿人民的生活质量日益改善，金砖国家在国际上的地位和作用不断提升。, ——这是拓展合作、互利共赢的10年。我们秉持开放、包容、合作、共赢的金砖精神，努力构建全方位、多层次的合作架构，合作领域不断拓展，合作机制不断完善，合作成果不断涌现。我们设立新开发银行和建立应急储备安排，推动节能和提高能效合作，加强气候变化立场协调，彰显了金砖国家合作的行动力和有效性，开辟了南南合作新路径。, ——这是敢于担当、有所作为的10年。我们携手应对国际金融危机冲击，为促进全球经济金融稳定作出重要贡献。国际货币基金组织报告指出，过去10年，金砖国家对世界经济增长的贡献超过50%。我们秉持国际公平正义，在重大国际和地区问题上共同发声、仗义执言。我们积极推进全球经济治理改革进程，大大提升了新兴市场国家和发展中国家的代表性和发言权。, 各位同事！, “明镜所以照形，古事所以知今。”我们回顾过去，是为了继往开来，再铸辉煌。, 当前，世界经济复苏势头仍然脆弱，全球贸易和投资低迷，大宗商品价格持续波动，引发国际金融危机的深层次矛盾远未解决。一些国家政策内顾倾向加重，保护主义抬头，“逆全球化”思潮暗流涌动。地缘政治因素错综复杂，传统和非传统安全风险相互交织，恐怖主义、传染性疾病、气候变化等全球性挑战更加凸显。金砖国家发展面临着复杂、严峻的外部环境。, 本次领导人会晤以“打造有效、包容、共同的解决方案”为主题，很有针对性。在国际大环境带来的挑战面前，我们必须坚定信心，共同面对。, 经过10年发展，金砖国家合作已经是枝繁叶茂、树大根深。我们完全有能力化挑战为机遇，化压力为动力，同舟共济，共克时艰。我们要贡献金砖国家的智慧和力量，携手寻找应对之道。, 第一，共同建设开放世界。开放是实现国家繁荣富强的根本出路。我们要遵循历史发展的客观规律，顺应当今时代发展潮流，推进结构性改革，创新增长方式，构建开放型经济，旗帜鲜明反对各种形式的保护主义。我们要加强宏观经济政策协调，以推进经贸大市场、金融大流通、基础设施大联通、人文大交流为抓手，走向国际开放合作最前沿，在国际舞台上积极发挥引领作用。, 第二，共同勾画发展愿景。实现包容和可持续发展，既是各国人民的共同期许，也是世界经济持续稳定增长的动力源泉。我们要继续高举发展旗帜，结合落实2030年可持续发展议程和二十国集团领导人杭州峰会成果，加强南北对话和南南合作，用新思路、新理念、新举措为国际发展合作注入新动力、开辟新空间，推动全球经济实现强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长。, 第三，共同应对全球性挑战。金砖国家同呼吸、共命运，既是息息相关的利益共同体，更是携手前行的行动共同体。我们要加强在重大国际问题以及地区热点上的协调沟通，共同行动，推动热点问题的政治解决，携手应对自然灾害、气候变化、传染病疫情、恐怖主义等全球性问题。既要联合发声，倡导国际社会加大投入，也要采取务实行动，推动解决实际问题，注重标本兼治、综合施策，从根源上化解矛盾，为国际社会实现长治久安作出贡献。, 第四，共同维护公平正义。公平正义的全球治理是实现各国共同发展的必要条件。我们要继续做全球治理变革进程的参与者、推动者、引领者，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展，继续提升新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权。我们要继续做国际和平事业的捍卫者，坚持按照联合国宪章宗旨、原则和国际关系准则，按照事情本身的是非曲直处理问题，释放正能量，推动构建合作共赢的新型国际关系。, 第五，共同深化伙伴关系。金砖国家是真诚相待的好朋友、好兄弟、好伙伴，这种友谊和合作必将不断深化。我们要以落实《金砖国家经济伙伴战略》为契机，深化拓展各领域经济合作，提升金砖国家整体竞争力。我们要把金砖国家新开发银行和应急储备安排这两个机制建设好、维护好、发展好，为发展中国家经济发展提供有力保障。我们要加强人文交流，促进民心相通，夯实金砖国家合作的民意基础。我们要继续扩大和巩固金砖国家“朋友圈”，保持开放、包容，谋求共同发展。, 各位同事！, 中国是金砖机制的坚定支持者和参与者，把金砖国家合作作为中国外交的重要方向，相信金砖国家合作会有力促进世界和平、稳定、繁荣。明年，中国将接任金砖国家轮值主席国，主办金砖国家领导人第九次会晤。我们深感重任在肩，同时也充满信心。我们将同各成员国一道，携手努力，规划金砖国家发展新蓝图。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社印度果阿10月16日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年10月17日 02 版）, ]",习近平在金砖国家领导人第八次会晤大范围会议上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28782971
8,55,"[, On October 12, on the eve of a state visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Being a Good Neighbor, True Friend"" in the Cambodian ""Light of Cambodia"" newspaper. The article is as follows:, good neighbors and true friends who are close friends, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of King Sihamoni of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I will pay a state visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is my first visit to Cambodia after becoming the Chinese President. I am looking forward to this visit. , Cambodia is an important stop on the ancient Maritime Silk Road, with a long and glorious history and unique Khmer culture. The industrious and intelligent Cambodian people have created dazzling Angkor monuments. Their magnificent architecture and exquisite relief frescoes are ingenious and amazing, leaving an immortal chapter in the history of human civilization. In the 21st century, Cambodia's national construction is booming, and people's living standards are constantly improving, and the future is worth looking forward to. China and Cambodia are geographically and culturally close, and the history of friendly exchanges between the two countries can be traced back more than 1,000 years. Through the Maritime Silk Road, Chinese porcelain and lacquer ware, Cambodian spices and yellow wax are continuously delivered to the other people. The frescoes at Bayon Temple are engraved with vivid scenes of ancient Chinese businessmen interacting with the Cambodian people. From the 5th century to the 6th century, during the Southern and Northern Dynasties of China, the three monks, Sangha Brahman, Mandala, and Sudhi, were later spreading Buddhist scriptures in China. Zhou Daguan, the envoy of the Yuan Dynasty in China, wrote a book called ""Zhen La Territory"" after his visit to Cambodia, which recorded the customs of Angkor and the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Cambodia. The Chinese navigator Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty stayed in Cambodia many times during his voyage, calling it “the climate is always hot, Tian He is abundant, the sea is boiled as salt, and the customs are rich”. The incense in the Sanbaogong Temple, located on the outskirts of Kampong Cham, tells the indissoluble bond between the people of China and Cambodia. , The Cambodian proverb says ""Trust is like a tree"". The traditional friendship between China and Cambodia has undergone years of baptism and international changes and has always been deeply rooted. This benefited from the elaborate cultivation of the older generation leaders of the two countries. In 1958, China officially established diplomatic relations with Cambodia, and the relationship between the two countries opened a new chapter. Over the past 58 years, the leaders of the two countries have maintained close contacts and established a profound friendship. Emperor Sihanouk said emotionally: ""The long-term strong friendship between Cambodia and China is like a flower that will never fade, and it will always be open under a clear sky."" This is a true portrayal of China-Cambodia friendship. Entering a new era, China-Cambodia friendship has lasted forever, has been inherited and carried forward. The two countries have a high degree of political mutual trust, mutually beneficial economic win-win results, and fruitful results in practical cooperation in various fields. They maintain close communication and coordination in international and regional affairs, and can be regarded as a model of equality and sincere cooperation between countries. In 2010, China and Cambodia established a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership, and bilateral relations entered a new era. The two countries have a high degree of agreement on the national development philosophy and agreed to accelerate the integration of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative and the ""four corners"" strategy. In recent years, bilateral trade and two-way investment have maintained a strong growth momentum. China has been Cambodia’s largest trading partner and largest source of investment for three consecutive years. In 2015, bilateral trade exceeded US$4.4 billion. , China and Cambodia are good friends who share the same spirit. When it comes to issues related to each other’s core interests and major concerns, the two countries share the same situation and help each other. In Cambodia’s struggle for national independence and national liberation, maintenance and peace, China has given Cambodia solid support and assistance. In the 1990s, China sent more than 800 engineering troops to participate in peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. In 18 months, they completed the construction and repair of 4 national-level highways with a total length of more than 640 kilometers, including 3 airports in Phnom Penh International Airport, and erected and repaired more than 40 bridges. They cultivated Sino-Cambodian friendship with blood and sweat. We will not forget that Cambodia was the first to establish diplomatic relations with China when it was subjected to external blockade and hostility at the beginning of the founding of New China. In China’s struggle to restore its legal seat in the United Nations, Cambodia has given firm support. At a time when China resolutely safeguards its national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and is committed to resolving disputes through peaceful negotiations, Cambodia upholds justice and justice. When severe natural disasters occurred in Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and other places in China, the Cambodian royal family, government leaders, and all sectors of society felt the same and extended a helping hand. The Chinese often say, ""See the true feelings in times of trouble."" The Cambodian proverb says, ""Only in trouble can we identify who is a true friend and who is a fake friend."" The Chinese people and the Cambodian people cherish their promises and treat each other honestly. The friendship between China and Cambodia has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples. , China and Cambodia are good neighbors who are sympathetic.

China has aided in the construction of Cambodia’s first full-lane four-lane national highway, undertaking the construction of Cambodia’s first cement plant, first thermal power station, and largest hydropower station. The booming Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone is a model for pragmatic cooperation between China and Cambodia. As of June 2016, a total of 100 enterprises have entered the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, with an investment of US$280 million, which has solved the employment problem of more than 13,000 Cambodian people. The two countries have taken advantage of their complementary economies and tapped their potential to expand cooperation and scale in infrastructure construction, agricultural water conservancy, energy resources, and information and communications. The early harvest prospects for a series of cooperation projects are promising. The people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Cambodia are becoming closer and closer, which has continuously injected new vitality into bilateral relations. Chinese cultural relics experts have taken root in Cambodia for many years to protect and restore Angkor cultural relics such as Zhousa Temple and Chajiao Temple. Chinese medical experts traveled to Cambodia for free clinics to perform cataract surgery for thousands of Cambodian people. Chinese agrotechnical experts went deep into the rural areas of Cambodia, teaching agricultural technology during the day and teaching Chinese at night, which was welcomed and loved by the Cambodian people.

10,57,"[, On June 17, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Poland, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Promoting the Full Speed ​​Advance of China-Poland Friendship Ships"" in the Polish ""Republic"". The article reads as follows:, Promoting the China-Poland Friendship Ship to Advance at Full Speed, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Duda, I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Poland. This is my first visit to Poland after becoming the Chinese President. I look forward to in-depth exchange of views with President Duda and other Polish leaders on improving the level of relations between the two countries, deepening practical cooperation, and strengthening China-Poland coordination and cooperation on major international and regional issues. , I visited Poland in the 1990s, and that visit left a deep impression on me. The Polish people are hardworking, brave, and wise, and have a profound historical and cultural heritage. Copernicus explored the infinity of the universe and created the ""heliocentric theory"", which changed the human outlook on the universe. Mrs. Curie recognized the infinitesimal microcosm and discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, which promoted the development and application of radioactivity theory. Like all music lovers in the world, the Chinese people love the works of master Chopin, especially the beautiful melody of Chopin's piano music has always echoed in our hearts. Although China and Poland are far apart, they have a long history of interaction with each other. In the mid-17th century, Polish missionary Bumag came to China, extensively studied Chinese society, history, medicine, geography and other disciplines, and published a large number of books. He was the first European to introduce the achievements of ancient Chinese science and culture to the West, known as ""Poland Marco Polo"". Both China and Poland have a proverb called ""See the truth in adversity"". During the Second World War, the people of the two countries sympathized with and supported each other and forged a profound friendship. Polish friends such as Fraud and Jungman came to China not far away to provide medical support for the Chinese Anti-Japanese War. Polish soldiers such as Urbanovic and Shimankevic participated in the aid of the Allied forces to China. The Polish people have made tremendous sacrifices and made significant contributions to the final victory over fascism and world peace. , Poland is one of the first countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with New China. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 67 years ago, the traditional friendship between the people of China and Poland has continuously deepened. In the early days of the founding of New China, Poland provided a lot of support and assistance to China's economic and social development, especially in the fields of mining, sugar refining, and shipping. The China-Poland Steamship Company, established in 1951, is the first Sino-foreign joint venture in New China and has been operating well so far. The Masovian Song and Dance Ensemble is the first foreign performing group to visit New China. The performances of Polish folk songs and dances such as ""Mazuka"", ""Poronitz"", ""Little Cuckoo"" and ""Reed Flute"" have been circulating to this day. In recent years, China-Poland relations have developed rapidly. At the end of last year, President Duda successfully visited China, and we reached broad consensus on strengthening high-level exchanges between the two countries, deepening strategic mutual trust, and promoting practical cooperation in various fields. The two sides signed an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding on jointly promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road”, which laid a solid foundation for exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields. Poland is the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to establish a strategic partnership with China and join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. In recent years, China and Poland have maintained stable economic growth and have been each other’s largest trading partners in their respective regions for many years. In 2015, the bilateral trade volume between China and Poland reached US$17.09 billion, and the two-way investment increased steadily. The scale of cooperation between the two parties in mining, infrastructure construction, transportation and logistics, finance, aerospace, science and technology, agriculture and other fields continued to expand and the level continued to increase. , Sino-Polish humanities exchanges are increasingly active. ""Happy Chinese New Year·Poland Tour"" has been held for 6 consecutive times, and the Polish Cultural Season, Polish Cultural Festival and other activities have been carried out in China. Five Confucius Institutes have taken root in Poland one after another, and more and more Chinese universities offer Polish language teaching. The China-Poland Local Forum was successfully held for three sessions, providing a platform for local exchanges between the two countries. The humanities exchanges between the two sides are diverse in form and rich in connotation. The traditional friendship between the two countries has been handed down and continues to glow with new brilliance. , Central and Eastern Europe is the region with the most potential for development in Europe. China and Central and Eastern European countries have deep traditional friendship, sincere willingness to cooperate, and strong economic complementarity, which provides plenty of cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries (“16+1 cooperation”) Power and huge space. Over the past four years, the parties concerned have respected each other, benefited each other, and are open and inclusive. The ""16+1 cooperation"" has maintained a momentum of rapid development. The breadth and depth of cooperation have continued to expand, and it has entered a mature period and a harvest period. We must pragmatically promote ""16+1 cooperation"" in the spirit of facing the future and benefiting the people, and make greater contributions to the prosperity of Europe and the development of China-EU relations. , China and the EU are comprehensive strategic partners. China-EU relations are developing smoothly and face good historical opportunities. In 2014, during my visit to the EU headquarters, I decided to work with EU leaders to build a. China-EU relations are developing smoothly and face good historical opportunities. In 2014, during my visit to the EU headquarters, I decided to work with EU leaders to build the four partnerships of China-EU peace, growth, reform, and civilization, and established the strategic direction of China-EU cooperation in the new era. The two sides jointly decided to promote the construction of the five major platforms including the China-Europe Common Investment Fund, the Connectivity Platform, Legal Affairs Dialogue, Digital Cooperation, and Facilitating Personnel Exchanges. At present, both China and the EU are advancing structural reforms to promote economic and social development. China has put forward the development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness, and sharing, and is committed to transforming the structure and adjusting the structure to promote the economy to maintain medium and high-speed growth and the industry to move to the mid-to-high-end level. The EU is maintaining economic development momentum, implementing European investment plans, and launching a series of combined measures. As the world's two major forces, two markets and two civilizations, China and Europe can fully connect their respective development strategies, deepen the integration of interests, promote common growth, and make positive contributions to world peace and development. ""16+1 cooperation"" and the development of China-EU relations are inseparable from the development of bilateral relations between China and countries in the region. At present, China-Poland relations are facing good development opportunities. The wife in the science home of your country once said: ""People should not always look at what they have done, but should pay attention to what is still to be done."" I look forward to this visit and working with Polish leaders to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in various fields and promote ""16+1 cooperation"" and China-EU relations are developing to a higher level, in a wider field and at a deeper level. -We must uphold equality and mutual trust, and challenge the times together. Over the past 67 years, China and Poland have made great achievements based on their own national conditions and adhered to the development path that suits their own national conditions. Confucius, an ancient Chinese thinker, said that ""righteousness is the quality"" and ""belief is the quality"". Both sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, understand and support each other’s core interests and major concerns, and ensure the long-term stable and healthy development of China-Poland relations. -We need to strengthen strategic integration and discuss development plans together. Poland is Europe's ""crossroad"" and the meeting point of ""Amber Road"" and ""Silk Road"". At present, there are many Central European trains passing through Poland or taking Poland as the destination. The two sides should build on the signing of an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding to jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”, step up the preparation of the two countries’ planning outlines, fully sort out and prepare major cooperation projects, and strive for early gains. -We must deepen pragmatic cooperation and promote economic development. Poland is committed to re-industrialization, and China is vigorously promoting international production capacity cooperation. China is willing to work with Poland to participate in Poland's re-industrialization process through capacity cooperation, deepen cooperation in various fields such as energy, infrastructure construction, transportation and logistics, communications, and aerospace, and increase the amount of bilateral cooperation. ——We want to expand cultural exchanges and consolidate traditional friendship. Both China and Poland have rich and excellent history and cultural traditions. We must learn from each other, expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, locality, tourism, sports, etc., so that the youth of the two countries can receive the baton of Sino-Polish friendship and make positive contributions to consolidating the traditional friendship between the two countries. ——We need to make good use of existing platforms and seek regional cooperation. Poland is the first advocate of ""16+1 cooperation"" and the host country of the first ""16+1"" leaders' meeting. It has always actively supported and participated in ""16+1 cooperation"" and played an important role in promoting investment and business. We are willing to work with Central and Eastern European countries including Poland to make good use of this regional cooperation platform and benefit the people of the 17 countries. -We want to promote China-EU cooperation and create a better future together. China and Europe should conform to the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win, deepen strategic cooperation between the two sides, strengthen communication and coordination in international affairs, and contribute to the promotion of a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core and a community of shared future for mankind. , Let us work together to push the China-Poland friendship ship along the mutually beneficial and win-win waterway towards the bright future of China-Poland relations, China-CEEC cooperation and China-EU relations.

11,58,"[, On June 16, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Serbia, President Xi Jinping published a signed article titled ""Eternal Friends Sincere Friends"" in the Serbian Political News and the New Yugoslav News Agency. The article is as follows: Forever Friends Sincere Partners, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, At the invitation of President Tomislav Nikolić, I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Serbia. Visiting the beautiful and legendary AIA in this flowery season makes me feel cordial. I look forward to discussing friendship with President Nicolić and other leaders of Serbia, seeking cooperation and looking forward to the future, and pushing China-Serbia strategic partnership to a new height. , Serbia is an important country in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans, with a long history and splendid culture. For thousands of years, Eastern and Western civilizations have blended and collided here, stirring up important achievements in the development of human civilization. In this process, the industrious and courageous Serbian people wrote a heroic epic for national independence and freedom and a magnificent chapter in pursuit of a beautiful and happy life. In the 1940s, the Chinese people and the Yugoslav people bravely resisted fascist aggression on the battlefields of the East and the West, and achieved national liberation and freedom. In the early 1950s, China officially established diplomatic relations with the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia, which opened a new page in the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the Serbian people. The ancient Chinese thinker Mencius said: ""You are also friends, and you are also virtuous."" For more than 60 years, the people of the two countries have always connected with each other and have special feelings for each other. , Serbia has a saying: ""Friends are the fruits of time."" We will not forget that ""Walter Defends Sarajevo"", ""Bridge"" and other famous films have inspired countless Chinese patriotic enthusiasm, ""Ah, goodbye friends"" song It is still sung in China. In the 1980s, during the critical period of China's reform and opening-up policy, the successful practice and experience of the Serbian people provided a valuable reference for China. , We will not forget that after the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan, China in 2008, Serbia reached out to China for the first time and selflessly provided a large amount of relief materials to the people in the disaster area. In September 2015, President Nicolic went to Beijing to attend the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War, and issued a joint effort between China and Serbia to maintain post-war international order, safeguard world peace, and build humanity. The strongest voice of a better future. We will never forget that mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual support, and win-win cooperation are the true portrayal of China-Serbia relations. No matter how the international situation changes and how China and Serbia develop and change, the two sides always fully understand and respect each other's path, firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns, and are committed to deepening mutual political trust and mutually beneficial cooperation. At present, the traditional friendship between China and Serbia is increasingly glowing with new vitality, and the depth and breadth of relations between the two countries are constantly improving. In recent years, I have met with President Nicolic many times and reached important consensus on consolidating traditional friendship, deepening political mutual trust, and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation. In 2009, China and Serbia established a strategic partnership, and Serbia became the first Central and Eastern European country to establish a strategic partnership with China. In 2013, I signed the ""Sino-Cypriot Joint Statement on Deepening Strategic Partnership"" with President Nicolic. The strategic importance of bilateral relations has become more prominent. Within the framework of bilateral relations, the “Belt and Road” initiative, and “16+1 cooperation”, the two countries have continuously made new breakthroughs in pragmatic cooperation, and the results are most prominent in Central and Eastern Europe. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. A large number of major projects such as the Hungary-Serbia Railway, the Belgrade Cross Danube Bridge, the E763 highway, the reconstruction and expansion of the Kostolac Power Station, and the Hebei Iron and Steel Group's acquisition of the Serbian Smederevo Steel Plant have successively landed, forming an overall advancement of cooperation between the two countries The gratifying situation achieved good economic and social benefits, and had a positive impact in Central and Eastern Europe. The cultural exchanges between the two countries are getting closer, cooperation in various fields such as culture, education, science and technology is good, and inter-party and local exchanges are frequent. The two sides signed the ""Agreement on Mutually Establishing Cultural Centers"". Belgrade and Novi Sad University have opened Confucius Institutes. Serbia has started piloting Chinese language teaching in more than 100 primary and secondary schools across the country. The Belgrade Chinese Cultural Center is about to start construction. The people of China and Serbia have opened up new channels of communication. , Serbs say: ""Cross first, then speak"", Chinese often say ""action is better than words"". China attaches great importance to developing relations with Serbia, cherishes the profound traditional friendship between the two countries, and is willing to further tap the potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, achieve complementary advantages, and promoteChina attaches great importance to developing relations with Serbia, cherishes the profound traditional friendship between the two countries, and is willing to further tap the potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, achieve complementary advantages, and promote the stability of the relations between the two countries. My visit to Serbia this time is to work with the Serbian side, through in-depth exchanges and extensive consultations, to use concrete actions to bring China and Serbia and the two peoples closer together, to be eternal friends and sincere partners . , ——We must always focus on the long-term and insist on mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual understanding. Both sides should continue to give each other firm support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and constantly improve the strategic and comprehensive nature of the relationship between the two countries. China respects the development path chosen by the Serbian people, respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia, and understands that Serbia is committed to joining the EU. , ——We must always adhere to mutual benefit and win-win progress together and common development. China is willing to share development achievements and opportunities with Serbia, explore and strengthen the integration of development strategies between the two sides, and expand the integration of interests, focusing on expanding the scale of trade and investment within the framework of the ""Belt and Road"" and ""16+1 cooperation"", constantly tapping the potential of cooperation and creating More large-scale project cooperation has made China-Serbia cooperation a benchmark and a model for ""16+1 cooperation"", which will benefit both peoples. -We must always strive to consolidate the basis of public opinion in the relations between the two countries. The two sides should fully explore and use the traditional friendship treasures of the two countries, open up new channels and expand new ways, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as education, culture and tourism, so that the friendship between China and Serbia will be passed on. , ——We must always maintain close communication and collaboration in international affairs. The two sides should cooperate with each other in the United Nations and other international organizations and agencies, and pay attention to and take care of each other's concerns on major international and regional issues. China looks forward to working with Serbia to make due contributions to maintaining regional stability and world peace, and promoting the common development and prosperity of mankind. , I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the road of strategic partnership between China and Serbia will surely go wider and wider.

12,59,"[, Secretary of State Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lu,, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends: Today, the eighth round of China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the seventh round of Sino-US cultural exchange The consultation was held in Beijing. First of all, I sincerely congratulate the opening of the dialogue and consultation! Warm welcome to American friends coming from afar! At this time three years ago, President Obama and I held a meeting at the Annaberg Manor. The two sides agreed to strengthen strategic communication, expand pragmatic cooperation, properly manage differences, and strive to build a new Sino-US relationship. , No pain no gain. After three years of hard work, we have gained a lot. With the efforts of both sides, China and the United States have cooperated in many fields at the bilateral, regional, and global levels to promote the development of bilateral relations and achieve new results. The trade volume and two-way investment between the two countries have reached a record high, humanities and local exchanges have been closer, and cooperation in the fields of networks and law enforcement and exchanges between the two armies have made new progress. The two countries issued three joint statements on climate change and worked with the international community to advance the historic Paris Agreement. The two countries have also maintained effective communication and coordination on hot issues such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear, Iranian nuclear, Afghanistan, and Syria. These cooperations have brought tangible benefits to both China and the United States, and have also vigorously promoted peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. The three-year results are hard-won and have given us a lot of inspiration. The most fundamental one is that the two sides must adhere to the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation, and unswervingly promote the construction of new Sino-US relations of great powers. This choice is in the fundamental interests of the people of China and the United States, and is also the common aspiration of people of all countries. No matter how the international situation changes, we should stick to this general direction and make unremitting efforts. Now, we are in a world of rapid development and change. The world's multi-polarization, economic globalization, and social informatization are advancing in depth. Various challenges are emerging, and the interests of all countries are closely linked. Zero-sum games and conflict confrontation have long been outdated, and working together in the same boat and achieving win-win cooperation have become the requirements of the times. As the world's largest developing country, the largest developed country, and the two largest economies, China and the United States should start from the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the people of other countries, and take the courage to take on the direction of building a new relationship between China and the United States. Struggle forward. ——We want to strengthen mutual trust between the two countries. Chinese people always pay attention to ""faith"". More than 2000 years ago, Confucius said: ""People have no faith, but they don't know what they can do."" Trust is the basis of the relationship between people and the prerequisite for country-to-state communication. If we want to prevent the clouds from covering our eyes and avoid strategic misjudgments, we must accumulate strategic mutual trust through regular communication. Once this issue is resolved, the foundation for Sino-US cooperation will be more solid and the momentum will be stronger. -We must actively expand mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 37 years ago, the connotation and extension of Sino-US cooperation have continued to expand, benefiting both peoples. We must uphold the win-win concept and continuously improve the level of cooperation. At present, we must focus on strengthening macroeconomic policy coordination, work with all parties concerned to promote the positive outcome of the G20 Hangzhou Summit, deliver confidence to the international community, and inject momentum into the world economy. We must strive to reach a mutually beneficial and win-win China-US investment agreement at an early date, and create new highlights in economic and trade cooperation. It is necessary to deepen exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the fields of climate change, development, networking, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, the two armed forces, and law enforcement, strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional, and global issues, and bring more benefits to the two peoples. More practical interests will provide more public goods for world peace, stability and prosperity. -We must properly manage differences and sensitive issues. China and the United States have their own characteristics, and their history, culture, social system, and people's demands are different. There are some differences between the two sides that are inevitable. The world is diverse, and there can be no world without differences. A family often has such differences. It is not terrible to have differences. The key is not to use differences as a reason for confrontation. Some differences can be resolved through hard work. The two sides should work harder to resolve them. Some differences may not be resolved for a while, and both sides should think more about each other’s specific situation and manage them in a pragmatic and constructive manner. As long as the two sides adhere to the principles of mutual respect and equal treatment and insist on seeking common ground while reserving differences and gathering and assimilating differences, there will be no hardships and the relationship between China and the United States will avoid major interference. -We must strengthen communication and cooperation on Asia-Pacific affairs. The broad Pacific Ocean should not become an arena for gaming among countries, but should be a large platform for everyone to tolerate cooperation. China pursues the concept of diplomacy of sincerity and gratitude, and is always committed to promoting peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. China and the United States have extensive common interests in the Asia-Pacific region and should maintain regularityRong’s surrounding diplomatic philosophy has always been committed to promoting peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. China and the United States have extensive common interests in the Asia-Pacific region. They should maintain regular dialogue, conduct more cooperation, respond to various challenges, and strive to cultivate a common but not exclusive ""circle of friends"" between the two countries, as builders and guardians of regional prosperity and stability. By. , ——We want to build the friendship between the two peoples. People's friendly exchanges are the source of country-to-state relations. The basis for the development of Sino-US relations is mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. I have visited the United States many times. Whether it is an old friend in Iowa or the cute children at Lincoln Middle School in Tacoma, I have been deeply touched by the friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. I am happy to see that there were nearly 5 million personnel exchanges between the two countries last year. The two sides should build more platforms and provide more convenience for the exchanges between the two countries, so that the friendship between China and the United States will continue to spread and endlessly. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! This year is the first year for China to implement the ""13th Five-Year Plan"". China will implement the strategic layout of building a well-off society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly, implement the development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness, and sharing, and focus on promoting supply-side structural reforms and promoting transformation. Adjust the structure and continue to improve the layout of opening up. We are full of confidence in achieving China's economic and social development goals. China will provide more development opportunities for the world, and will cooperate more closely with countries around the world, including the United States. , China is unswervingly following the path of peaceful development, advocating that all countries take the path of peaceful development together, promoting the establishment of a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core, and building a community of shared future for mankind. We are willing to strengthen cooperation with all countries in the world, jointly safeguard the international order and international system centered on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and make the planet we live in better. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the High-level Consultation Mechanism for People-to-People Exchanges have played an important role in enhancing strategic mutual trust between the two countries, expanding mutually beneficial cooperation, and deepening the friendship between the two peoples. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the working teams of both sides and all people from all walks of life in the two countries who care and support dialogue and consultation! It is hoped that the teams of both parties will not bear the utmost care and make persistent efforts, in-depth communication and build consensus in the next two days to achieve more practical results. , Song Qiji, a poet in the Song Dynasty of China, has a famous saying, ""The mountains can't be covered, after all, they go eastward."" It means that the rivers and rivers of the world go back and forth, after many twists and turns, they will eventually run to the sea. As long as we are firm in our direction and persevering, we will certainly promote greater development of the relationship between China and the United States as a new type of great power and better benefit the peoples of the two countries and peoples of other countries. , Finally, I wish this round of China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and High-level Consultations on Humanistic Exchange a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 6th), ""People's Daily"" (June 07, 2016, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Make Unremitting Efforts to Build New Sino-US Relations,2408,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-06-07,"[, 克里国务卿，, 雅各布·卢财长，, 各位来宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天，第八轮中美战略与经济对话和第七轮中美人文交流高层磋商在北京举行。首先，我对对话和磋商的开幕，表示衷心的祝贺！对远道而来的美国朋友，表示热烈的欢迎！, 3年前的这个时节，我同奥巴马总统在安纳伯格庄园举行会晤，双方同意加强战略沟通，拓展务实合作，妥善管控分歧，努力构建中美新型大国关系。, 一分耕耘，一分收获。3年耕耘，我们有了不少收获。在双方努力下，中美两国在双边、地区、全球层面众多领域开展合作，推动两国关系发展取得新成果。两国贸易额和双向投资达到历史新高，人文和地方交流更加密切，网络、执法等领域合作和两军交往取得新进展。两国发表了3个气候变化联合声明，同国际社会一道推动达成具有历史意义的《巴黎协定》。两国在朝鲜半岛核、伊朗核、阿富汗、叙利亚等热点问题上也保持了有效沟通和协调。这些合作给中美双方带来了实实在在的利益，也有力促进了亚太地区及世界和平、稳定、发展。, 3年的成果来之不易，也给了我们很多启示，最根本的一条就是双方要坚持不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢的原则，坚定不移推进中美新型大国关系建设。这个选择符合中美两国人民根本利益，也是各国人民普遍愿望。无论国际风云如何变幻，我们都应该坚持这个大方向，毫不动摇为之努力。, 现在，我们正处在一个快速发展变化的世界里。世界多极化、经济全球化、社会信息化深入推进，各种挑战层出不穷，各国利益紧密相连。零和博弈、冲突对抗早已不合时宜，同舟共济、合作共赢成为时代要求。作为世界上最大的发展中国家、最大的发达国家和前两大经济体，中美两国更应该从两国人民和各国人民根本利益出发，勇于担当，朝着构建中美新型大国关系的方向奋力前行。, ——我们要增强两国互信。中国人历来讲究“信”。2000多年前，孔子就说：“人而无信，不知其可也。”信任是人与人关系的基础、国与国交往的前提。我们要防止浮云遮眼，避免战略误判，就要通过经常性沟通，积累战略互信。这个问题解决好了，中美合作基础就会更加坚实，动力就会更加强劲。, ——我们要积极拓展两国互利合作。建交37年来，中美合作内涵和外延不断扩大，两国人民从中受益。要秉持共赢理念，不断提高合作水平。当前，要着力加强宏观经济政策协调，同有关各方一道推动二十国集团领导人杭州峰会取得积极成果，向国际社会传递信心，为世界经济注入动力。要全力争取早日达成互利共赢的中美投资协定，打造经贸合作新亮点。要深化两国在气候变化、发展、网络、反恐、防扩散、两军、执法等领域交流合作，加强双方在重大国际和地区以及全球性问题上的沟通和协调，给两国人民带来更多实际利益，为世界和平、稳定、繁荣提供更多公共产品。, ——我们要妥善管控分歧和敏感问题。中美两国各具特色，历史、文化、社会制度、民众诉求等不尽相同，双方存在一些分歧是难以避免的。世界是多样的，没有分歧就没有世界。一个家庭里还经常有这样那样的分歧。有了分歧并不可怕，关键是不要把分歧当成采取对抗态度的理由。有些分歧是可以通过努力解决的，双方应该加把劲，把它们解决掉。有些分歧可能一时解决不了，双方应该多从对方的具体处境着想，以务实和建设性的态度加以管控。只要双方遵循相互尊重、平等相待原则，坚持求同存异、聚同化异，就没有过不去的坎，中美两国关系就能避免受到大的干扰。, ——我们要就亚太事务加强沟通和合作。宽广的太平洋不应该成为各国博弈的竞技场，而应该成为大家包容合作的大平台。中国奉行亲诚惠容的周边外交理念，始终致力于促进亚太和平、稳定、发展。中美在亚太地区拥有广泛共同利益，应该保持经常性对话，开展更多合作，应对各种挑战，努力培育两国共同而非排他的“朋友圈”，都做地区繁荣稳定的建设者和守护者。, ——我们要厚植两国人民友谊。人民友好交往是国与国关系的源头活水。中美关系发展的基础是两国人民相互了解和友谊。我多次到访美国，无论是艾奥瓦州的老朋友，还是塔科马市林肯中学可爱的孩子们，对中国人民都抱有友好情谊，让我深受感动。我高兴地看到，去年两国人员往来近500万人次。双方要为两国各界交往搭建更多平台、提供更多便利，让中美友好薪火相传、生生不息。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 今年是中国实施“十三五”规划开局之年。中国将贯彻全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党的战略布局，落实创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念，着力推进供给侧结构性改革，推动转方式调结构，继续完善对外开放布局。我们对实现中国经济社会发展既定目标充满信心。中国将会为世界提供更多发展机遇，将会同包括美国在内的世界各国开展更密切的合作。, 中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，倡导各国共同走和平发展道路，推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造人类命运共同体。我们愿同世界各国加强合作，共同维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序和国际体系，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展，让我们生活的这个星球更加美好。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中美战略与经济对话和人文交流高层磋商机制为增进两国战略互信、拓展互利合作、加深两国人民友谊发挥了重要作用。我向双方工作团队，向所有关心、支持对话和磋商的两国各界人士，表示衷心的感谢！希望双方团队不负重托、再接再厉，在接下来的两天里深入沟通、积累共识，取得更多实际成果。, 中国宋代诗人辛弃疾有一句名句，叫作“青山遮不住，毕竟东流去”。意思是天下的大江大河千回百转，历经多少曲折，最终都会奔流到海。只要我们坚定方向、锲而不舍，就一定能推动中美新型大国关系建设得到更大发展，更好造福两国人民和各国人民。, 最后，祝本轮中美战略与经济对话和人文交流高层磋商取得圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京6月6日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年06月07日 02 版）, ]",习近平：为构建中美新型大国关系而不懈努力,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28416143
13,60,"[, Foreign Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends:, ""At the turn of spring and summer, grass and trees."" Welcome everyone to Beijing at this vibrant time. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I sincerely welcome the foreign ministers and representatives from member countries and observer countries of AsiaInfo and the responsible persons and representatives of relevant international organizations! Congratulations on the convening of this meeting! This meeting is the first time that the AsiaInfo Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in China, and it is also a major event to promote Asia’s security and development and the construction of AsiaInfo under the new situation. The theme of the meeting was ""Promoting Security through Dialogue"", to gather consensus among all parties, promote security in Asia, seek common development, strengthen the role of AsiaInfo, and promote trust and collaboration. This is of great significance to the security and prosperity of Asia and the world. , The world today is undergoing unprecedented historical changes. The trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win is unstoppable. At the same time, the planet we live in is not peaceful. It is still a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. In the process of world peace and development, Asia has a unique and important position. In Asia today, peace and stability are the general trend, and development and prosperity are the aspirations of the people. Asia's economy leads the world, regional cooperation and integration are on the rise, and Asia's strategic position in the global development situation continues to rise. At the same time, traditional security problems such as local turbulent conflicts in Asia still exist, non-traditional security threats such as terrorism are becoming increasingly prominent, and regional security cooperation needs to be strengthened urgently. At the 2014 AsiaInfo Shanghai Summit, I proposed to establish a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable view of Asian security, and to embark on a road of building and sharing a win-win Asian security. Over the past two years, developments in the international and regional situations have shown that maintaining regional security requires everyone's joint efforts. We must uphold and practice the Asian security concept, build consensus, promote dialogue, strengthen collaboration, promote the establishment of a security governance model with Asian characteristics, and jointly create a better future for Asian peace and prosperity. To this end, we must focus on the following aspects of efforts. First, grasp the direction and build a community of shared future for Asia. The safety and common destiny of Asian countries are intertwined. We want to develop a new partnership of win-win cooperation, respect each other, treat each other on an equal footing, help each other, help each other in the same boat, take into account the legitimate concerns of all countries when pursuing their own interests, promote the common development of all countries when seeking their own development, and respect the safety of all countries when safeguarding their own security Together to promote regional peace, stability and prosperity. We must deepen cooperation in the construction of security and trust measures in the fields of military politics, new threats and new challenges, economics, humanities, and environmental protection, and jointly support a blue sky for security and development in Asia. Second, lay a solid foundation to promote exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations. Asian nations, religions, and cultures are diverse, with different social systems, development paths, and levels of economic development. They have different perceptions and concerns about security issues. Under such circumstances, we must strengthen exchanges, strengthen communication, transform Asian diversity into a driving force for expanding exchanges and cooperation, promote the inclusiveness and mutual learning and common development of different civilizations, and play a role in maintaining regional peace and stability. All parties can gather wisdom and strength by participating in platforms and means such as the Asian Civilization Dialogue Conference to create a deeper foundation for comprehensive regional security governance. Thirdly, mutual understanding and concessions, and persist in dialogue and consultation to resolve disputes peacefully. ""The virtuous people are prosperous and the strong ones are killed."" Weak meat and strong food are contrary to the trend of the times. Poor soldiers can not create peace. Mutual understanding and mutual accommodation can bring stability, and perseverance in morality can win lasting security. We must insist on dialogue and consultation, in accordance with international law, and on the peaceful resolution of disputed issues, increase mutual trust through dialogue, resolve disputes through dialogue, and promote security through dialogue. In response to complex regional hotspot issues, all parties concerned must remain calm and uphold peace, avoid actions that escalate the situation, control the crisis by establishing rules and mechanisms, ease tensions by increasing mutual trust, resolve the crisis by political means, and gradually promote problem resolution. , Fourth, step by step, discuss the establishment of a security architecture that meets regional characteristics. There are multiple security cooperation mechanisms in Asia, all of which play a role in maintaining regional security. We must uphold and promote the long-established Asian approach of mutual respect, consensus, and care for the comfort of all parties in Asian countries, strengthen the coordination of various regional security mechanisms, and gradually develop cooperation around mutual agreement or similar goals to form synergy and achieve practical results. . On this basis, it is possible to gradually explore the establishment of a new regional security cooperation framework that conforms to Asian characteristics. AsiaInfo Non-Government Forum and other platforms can conduct discussions on this, and put forward ideas and suggestions on the principles and key directions of regional security cooperation. In today's world, the trend of cooperation is vast and the concept of tolerance is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people., Put forward ideas and suggestions on the principles and key directions of regional security cooperation. In today's world, the trend of cooperation is vast and the concept of tolerance is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Asian countries and people have the ability to maintain Asia’s security and development environment through dialogue and cooperation. Asia has always had a tradition of openness and tolerance, and it also has the wisdom to ascend the horizon. We welcome countries outside the region to contribute positive energy to peace and development in Asia, and work with Asian countries to promote security, stability, development and prosperity in Asia. Asia is stable and developing, which is good for the world; Asia is chaotic and declining, which is bad for the world. This is a profound truth taught by Asian history since modern times. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China pursues a peaceful foreign policy, proposes and takes the lead in implementing a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asian security concept, and has always been a maintainer, builder and contributor to international and regional security. China is unswervingly following the path of peaceful development, unswervingly maintaining the international order centered on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, unswervingly promoting the establishment of a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation, and is committed to building a community of shared future for mankind. For a long time, China has made positive contributions to the international and regional security risks, challenges and crises together with the international community. , The world pays attention to Asia, and Asia influences the world. At present, some hot issues concerning the security situation in Asia are highly concerned by the international community, and China has made active efforts to promote the resolution of these issues. Since the beginning of this year, the situation on the Korean Peninsula has continued to be tense. China has made great efforts to control the situation and promote dialogue and negotiation among all parties. We insist on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, maintain peace and stability on the peninsula, and resolve issues through dialogue and consultation. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China fully and completely implements relevant UN Security Council resolutions. As a close neighbor of the peninsula, we will never allow the peninsula to have wars and chaos. Once this happens, it will not benefit anyone. It is hoped that all parties will exercise restraint and not stimulate and intensify contradictions with each other, but work together to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue and negotiation as soon as possible and promote long-term stability in Northeast Asia. , Afghanistan is in a critical period of transition, facing many challenges and requiring the strong support of the international community. China actively participates in the Istanbul process in Afghanistan, supports the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan, and supports the inclusive political reconciliation process that is “led by the Arabs and owned by the Arabs”. China sincerely hopes that Afghanistan will achieve peace, stability and development at an early date, and is willing to work with the international community to continue to provide support and assistance for the peaceful reconstruction, political reconciliation and smooth transition of Afghanistan. The early resolution of issues such as Syria, Palestine and Israel not only serves the interests of the parties, but also the common expectation of the international community. China has always advocated the peaceful resolution of relevant issues through political negotiations, has been actively persuading peace and promoting talks in various ways, and will continue to make efforts to this end. China has played a constructive role in reaching a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue, and is willing to work with all parties to continue to promote the follow-up implementation of the comprehensive agreement. For a while, all parties have been concerned about the South China Sea issue. I want to emphasize that China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, firmly safeguarding its sovereignty and related rights in the South China Sea, and insisting on peaceful settlement of disputes through friendly consultations and negotiations with the countries directly involved. China is willing to work with ASEAN countries to build the South China Sea into a sea of ​​peace, friendship and cooperation. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Since China took over the chairmanship of AsiaInfo in 2014, China has conscientiously fulfilled its responsibilities, promoted dialogue and cooperation in various fields, and achieved positive results. In the next two years, China will be re-elected as chairman and is willing to work with all parties to promote AsiaInfo to play a greater role in regional security and development affairs. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all parties for their vigorous support and cooperation in the work of the Chinese presidency! At present, the Chinese people are working together to achieve the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China's development will continue to create more opportunities for all countries and bring more well-being to the people of all countries. In the process of pursuing the Chinese dream, the Chinese people will help and support people from all countries to realize their own beautiful dreams, realize the Asian dream of lasting peace and common prosperity, and create a better future for Asia! , Finally, I wish this meeting a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 28th), ""People's Daily"" (April 29, 2016, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the 5th Foreign Ministers' Meeting of AsiaInfo,2865,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-04-29,"[, 各位外长，各位来宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, “春夏之交，草木际天。”欢迎大家在这个生机盎然的时节来到北京。首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，对来自亚信成员国、观察员国的外长和代表以及有关国际组织的负责人和代表，表示诚挚的欢迎！对本次会议的召开，表示热烈的祝贺！, 这次会议是亚信外长会首次在中国举行，也是新形势下促进亚洲安全和发展、推动亚信建设的一件大事。会议以“以对话促安全”为主题，凝聚各方共识，促进亚洲安全，谋求共同发展，加强亚信作用，促进信任和协作。这对亚洲乃至世界安全和繁荣具有重要意义。, 当今世界正处在前所未有的历史性变革之中。和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流不可阻挡，同时我们所处的星球并不太平，维护世界和平、促进共同发展仍然任重道远。, 在世界和平与发展进程中，亚洲具有独特而重要的地位。今天的亚洲，和平稳定是大势所趋，发展繁荣是民心所向。亚洲经济领跑全球，区域合作和一体化进程方兴未艾，亚洲在全球发展全局中的战略地位不断上升。同时，亚洲局部动荡冲突等传统安全问题仍然存在，恐怖主义等非传统安全威胁日益突出，区域安全合作亟待加强。, 在2014年亚信上海峰会上，我倡议树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，走出一条共建共享共赢的亚洲安全之路。两年来，国际和地区形势发展变化表明，维护地区安全需要大家共同努力。我们要坚持和践行亚洲安全观，凝聚共识，促进对话，加强协作，推动构建具有亚洲特色的安全治理模式，共创亚洲和平与繁荣的美好未来。为此，我们要重点在以下方面作出努力。, 第一，把握方向，构建亚洲命运共同体。亚洲各国安危与共、命运相系。我们要发展合作共赢的新型伙伴关系，相互尊重，平等相待，守望相助，同舟共济，在追求本国利益时兼顾各国合理关切，在谋求本国发展时促进各国共同发展，在维护本国安全时尊重各国安全，一起来促进地区和平、稳定、繁荣。我们要深化军事政治、新威胁新挑战、经济、人文、环保等领域安全和信任措施建设合作，共同为亚洲安全和发展撑起一片蓝天。, 第二，夯实基础，推动不同文明交流互鉴。亚洲民族、宗教、文化多样，社会制度、发展道路、经济发展水平各异，对有关安全问题的认知和关切不尽相同。在这样的情况下，我们要加强交流、加强沟通，把亚洲多样性转化为扩大交流合作的动力，推动不同文明包容互鉴、共同发展，为维护地区和平稳定发挥作用。各方可以通过参与亚洲文明对话大会等平台和手段，汇聚智慧和力量，为地区安全综合治理营造更加深厚的基础。, 第三，互谅互让，坚持对话协商和平解决争议。“恃德者昌，恃力者亡。”弱肉强食有违时代潮流，穷兵黩武缔造不了和平，互谅互让才能带来稳定，坚守道义才能赢得持久安全。我们要坚持通过对话协商，依据国际法，坚持以和平方式解决争议问题，以对话增互信，以对话解纷争，以对话促安全。针对复杂的地区热点问题，有关各方要保持冷静、坚守和平，避免采取使局势升级的行动，通过建立规则机制管控危机，通过增进互信缓和紧张，通过政治手段化解危机，逐步推动问题解决。, 第四，循序渐进，探讨建立符合地区特点的安全架构。亚洲存在多个安全合作机制，在维护地区安全方面都发挥着一定作用。我们要坚持和发扬亚洲国家长期以来形成的相互尊重、协商一致、照顾各方舒适度的亚洲方式，加强地区各项安全机制协调，围绕彼此一致或相近目标逐步开展合作，形成合力，求得实效。在此基础上，可以逐步探讨构建符合亚洲特点的地区安全合作新架构。亚信非政府论坛等平台可以就此进行研讨，就地区安全合作的原则、重点方向等提出设想和建议。, 当今世界，合作潮流浩浩荡荡，包容理念深入人心。亚洲国家和人民有能力更有需要通过对话和合作维护亚洲安全和发展环境。亚洲一贯具有开放包容的传统，也拥有登高望远的智慧。我们欢迎域外国家为亚洲和平与发展贡献正能量，同亚洲国家一起促进亚洲安全稳定和发展繁荣。亚洲稳定了、发展了，对世界有利；亚洲混乱了、衰落了，对世界不利。这是近代以来亚洲历史告诉人们的一个深刻道理。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国奉行和平外交政策，提出并带头践行共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，始终是国际和地区安全的维护者、建设者、贡献者。中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，坚定不移维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序，坚定不移推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，致力于打造人类命运共同体。长期以来，中国同国际社会一道，共同应对国际和地区安全风险、挑战、危机，作出了积极贡献。, 世界关注亚洲，亚洲影响世界。当前，涉及亚洲安全形势的一些热点问题受到国际社会高度关注，中国为推动这些问题解决作出了积极努力。, 今年年初以来，朝鲜半岛局势持续紧张。中国为管控形势、推动各方对话谈判付出巨大努力。我们坚持朝鲜半岛无核化，坚持维护半岛和平稳定，坚持通过对话协商解决问题。作为联合国安理会常任理事国，中国全面完整执行联合国安理会有关决议。作为半岛近邻，我们决不允许半岛生战生乱，一旦发生这样的情况对谁都没有好处。希望各方保持克制，不要相互刺激和激化矛盾，而是要共同努力，把半岛核问题早日拉回到对话谈判解决的轨道，推动实现东北亚长治久安。, 阿富汗正处于关键转型期，面临多方面挑战，需要国际社会大力支持。中国积极参与阿富汗问题伊斯坦布尔进程，支持阿富汗和平重建，支持“阿人主导，阿人所有”的包容性政治和解进程。中国真诚希望阿富汗早日实现和平、稳定、发展，愿同国际社会一道，继续为阿富汗和平重建、政治和解、顺利转型提供支持和帮助。, 叙利亚、巴以等问题早日解决既符合当事各方利益，也是国际社会共同期盼。中国历来主张通过政治谈判推动有关问题和平解决，一直以各种方式积极劝和促谈，并将会继续为此作出努力。中国为伊朗核问题全面协议的达成发挥了建设性作用，愿同各方一道，继续推动全面协议的后续执行。, 一段时间以来，各方都很关心南海问题。我想强调，中国一贯致力于维护南海地区和平稳定，坚定维护自身在南海的主权和相关权利，坚持通过同直接当事国友好协商谈判和平解决争议。中方愿同东盟国家一道努力，将南海建设成为和平之海、友谊之海、合作之海。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 自2014年接任亚信主席国以来，中国认真履行职责，推进亚信各领域对话合作，取得积极成果。未来两年，中国将连任主席国，愿同各方一道推动亚信在地区安全和发展事务中发挥更大作用。在此，我谨对各方对中方主席国工作的大力支持和配合，表示衷心的感谢！, 当前，中国人民正在为实现全面建成小康社会奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而团结奋斗。中国发展将继续为各国创造更多机遇、给各国民众带来更多福祉。中国人民将在追求中国梦的过程中帮助和支持各国人民实现各自的美好梦想，一道实现持久和平、共同繁荣的亚洲梦，共创亚洲美好未来！, 最后，预祝本次会议取得圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京4月28日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年04月29日 02 版）, ]",习近平在亚信第五次外长会议开幕式上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28313169
14,61,"[, People's Daily Online, Beijing, March 26th. On March 26th, on the eve of a state visit to the Czech Republic, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Playing the Strong Voice of the Times of China-Jie Relations"" in the Czech ""Rights"" . The article is as follows:, a strong voice of the times for Sino-Czech relations, the President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, at the invitation of President Zeman, I will pay a state visit to the Czech Republic. This is my first visit to the Czech Republic after becoming the President of China. I look forward to in-depth exchange of views with President Zeman and other Czech leaders on improving the level of development of Sino-Victoria relations and major international and regional issues under the new situation. , Czechs are awe-inspiring, beautiful mountains and rivers, rich in humanities and history. In the 1990s, I visited the Czech Republic. The industrious and wise Czech people, the vigorous development of Czech economic and social construction, and the Bohemian civilization bred by the Vltava River have left a deep impression on me. The Czech Republic was one of the first countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with New China. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, the traditional friendship between the two countries and their peoples has continued to deepen. In the 1950s, the famous Czech painter Sklenal visited China and formed friendly friendship with Chinese artists such as Wu Zuoren and Qi Baishi. After returning to the Czech Republic, Skranal created many paintings of ""Monkey King"", which is called the seventy-third change of Sun Wukong. ""The Story of the Mole"" is the first cartoon to enter China. The cartoon image of the little mole is so easy-going and kind and brave, which is loved by the majority of children in China. The symphonic poem ""My Motherland"" composed by the music master Smetana and the book ""Good Soldier"" by the writer Hasek are widely known in China. In recent years, the development of China-Jie relationship has entered the fast lane. Within two years, I met with President Zeman four times and reached broad consensus on strengthening high-level exchanges between the two countries, deepening strategic mutual trust, and enhancing the level of exchanges and cooperation in various fields. At the end of 2015, the two sides signed an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding on jointly promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road”, which opened up a broader space for exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields. , China has been the Czech Republic’s largest trading partner outside the EU for many years, and the Czech Republic is China’s second largest trading partner in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2015, the bilateral trade volume between China and Czech Republic reached US$11 billion. The cooperation between China and Czech Republic in nuclear power, finance, aviation, technology, agriculture and other fields is changing rapidly, and the level and scale of cooperation are constantly improving. Many companies in the two countries have invested in each other's countries and their businesses have developed rapidly. , The vitality of China-Jie cultural exchanges burst out. The Czech Republic has become a longing destination for Chinese tourists. In 2015, the total number of Chinese tourists visiting the Czech Republic exceeded 300,000, a record high. Tourism cooperation has become a bright ""business card"" for China-Jie exchanges and cooperation. The first Chinese medicine center in Central and Eastern Europe settled in the Czech Republic. The cooperation between China and Czech Film and Television is on the rise. China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, which provides good opportunities for both sides to strengthen sports exchanges. , This visit is also my first visit to Central and Eastern European countries since I assumed the presidency. China has a long-standing and profound friendship with Central and Eastern European countries. Thanks to the strong political will of both sides and a good foundation of public opinion, China-Central and Eastern European countries cooperation (""16+1 cooperation"") came into being, and it is flourishing. Over the past four years, China has worked with Central and Eastern European countries to build mechanisms, build platforms, and promote cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual benefit, win-win and tolerance, and jointly promote the ""16+1 cooperation"" to gradually enter the mature stage and early harvest period. . China’s cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative and the continuous strengthening of China-EU strategic integration have brought together more vigorous momentum for “16+1 cooperation” and opened up a broader space. , The EU is China's comprehensive strategic partner. In March 2014, during my visit to the EU headquarters, I decided to work with European leaders to build the four partnerships of China-EU peace, growth, reform, and civilization, which indicated the strategic direction for China-EU relations in the new period. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Europe in 2015, the two sides decided to promote the integration of the “Belt and Road” initiative with development strategies such as the European Investment Plan, the establishment of a Sino-European joint investment fund, and an interconnection platform, which further established a new framework for practical cooperation between China and Europe. China-EU relations are in the best period of historical development and face unprecedented historical opportunities. At present, both China and the EU are advancing structural reforms to stimulate the vitality of economic and social development. The Chinese people are making unremitting efforts to build a well-off society in an all-round way, realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The 13th Five-Year Plan for China’s National Economic and Social Development recently announced and implemented, implements the innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development concept, is committed to stable growth, transformation, and structural adjustment. Keep the economy growing at a high speedThe innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development concept is dedicated to steady growth, transformation, and structural adjustment, and strives to maintain rapid economic growth in the next five years. The EU is committed to maintaining the momentum of economic recovery and vigorously enhancing the competitiveness of EU economic development. Against this background, China and the EU have a high degree of development strategy fit, huge cooperation potential, and broad prospects. China is willing to work with the European Union to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and win-win cooperation, and jointly contribute to the development of the world economy. The cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries and the development of China-EU relations need to rely on strong support of bilateral relations. At present, China and the Czech Republic are facing important historical opportunities for the development of bilateral relations. Through this visit, I look forward to working with Czech leaders to raise the level of bilateral relations and promote ""16+1 cooperation"" and the continuous development of China-EU relations. , ——Strengthening mutual political trust and indicating the direction of development. ""The elder who seeks wood must fix its roots."" China and the Czech Republic should improve the positioning of their bilateral relations in a timely manner, insist on viewing bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, and firmly support each other's core in the principle of mutual respect and equality. Interests and major concerns ensure the long-term healthy and stable development of China-Jie relations and firmly grasp the general direction of the development of bilateral relations. , ——Strengthen the strategic connection and release the potential of cooperation. China and the Czech Republic should take the signing of an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding to jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” as an important opportunity to strengthen the docking of their respective development strategies and visions, and further sort out and prepare for major cooperation projects to strive for early gains. -Strengthen economic and trade cooperation and benefit the people of both countries. After more than 30 years of reform and opening up, China has formed a large advantage in terms of capital, technology, and equipment, especially in the areas of railways and nuclear power construction. The Czech Republic is located in the heart of Europe, with a superior geographical position and a strong industrial foundation. It has unique advantages in the fields of machining, automobile manufacturing, aviation and other fields. China is willing to work with the Czech side to promote capacity cooperation on the basis of manufacturing, promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields such as finance, communications, smart industry, nano, and environmental protection, so that the people of the two countries can share more mutually beneficial cooperation results. , ——Strengthen the humanities exchanges and give the connotation of the times. The people of China and Czech Republic have always appreciated each other's civilization and culture. In recent years, they have continuously set off a climax of exchanges. We will continue to expand cultural and educational exchanges in the fields of culture, education, film and television, tourism, and health, encourage youth and students to communicate, and let the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries be passed on from generation to generation. ——Strengthen regional cooperation and make good use of the broad platform. The Czech Republic has always actively supported and participated in the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries. It has always been at the forefront of Central and Eastern European countries in terms of health and local cooperation, and has played an active and important role in ""16+1 cooperation"". We are willing to work together with the Central and Eastern European countries including the Czech Republic to make ""16+1 cooperation"" bigger and stronger. ——Strengthen China-EU cooperation and build a better future together. China and the EU should conform to the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win, continue to deepen their respective development strategies, strengthen communication and coordination on the international stage, and work together to push China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level. , Let us work together to sound the strong voice of the era of China-Victoria relations and jointly create a better tomorrow for China-CEE countries cooperation and China-EU relations. ,]","Xi Jinping publishes a signed article in the Czech media ""Playing the Strong Voice of the Times of China-Jie Relations""",2494,来源：人民网-人民日报          发布时间：2016-03-27,"[, 人民网北京3月26日电 3月26日，在对捷克共和国进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在捷克《权利报》发表题为《奏响中捷关系的时代强音》的署名文章。文章如下：, 奏响中捷关系的时代强音, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 应泽曼总统邀请，我将对捷克共和国进行国事访问。这是我担任中国国家主席后首次访问捷克。我期待同泽曼总统和捷克其他领导人就新形势下提高中捷关系发展水平以及重大国际和地区问题深入交换意见。, 捷克人杰地灵，山川秀美，人文历史底蕴深厚。上世纪90年代，我曾经到访捷克，勤劳智慧的捷克人民、蓬勃开展的捷克经济社会建设、伏尔塔瓦河孕育的波西米亚文明都给我留下了深刻印象。, 捷克是最早承认并同新中国建交的国家之一。建交67年来，中捷两国和两国人民传统友谊不断加深。上世纪50年代，捷克著名画家斯克莱纳尔到访中国，同吴作人、齐白石等中国美术大师结下友好情谊。斯克莱纳尔回到捷克后创作了许多《美猴王》画作，被称作孙悟空的第七十三种变化。《鼹鼠的故事》是最早进入中国的动画片。小鼹鼠憨态可掬、善良勇敢的卡通形象深受中国广大少年儿童喜爱。音乐大师斯美塔那创作的交响诗套曲《我的祖国》和文学家哈谢克的著作《好兵帅克》在中国广为人知。, 近年来，中捷关系发展驶入快车道。两年内，我同泽曼总统4度会面，就加强两国高层交往、深化战略互信、提升各领域交流合作水平达成广泛共识。2015年年底，双方签署关于共同推进“一带一路”建设的政府间谅解备忘录，为两国各领域交流合作开辟了更加广阔的空间。, 中国连续多年是捷克在欧盟外第一大贸易伙伴，捷克是中国在中东欧地区第二大贸易伙伴。2015年，中捷双边贸易额达到110亿美元。中捷核电、金融、航空、科技、农业等领域合作日新月异，合作水平和规模不断提升。两国多家企业到对方国家投资兴业，业务发展迅速。, 中捷人文交流活力迸发。捷克已经成为中国游客憧憬和向往的旅游目的地。2015年，来捷克旅游的中国游客总数突破30万人次，创历史新高。旅游合作已经成为中捷交流合作的一张亮丽“名片”。中东欧首家中医中心在捷克落户。中捷影视合作方兴未艾。中国将举办2022年冬奥会，为双方加强体育交流提供了良好机遇。, 这次访问也是我担任国家主席后第一次访问中东欧国家。中国同中东欧国家有着源远流长的深厚友谊。得益于双方的强烈政治意愿和良好的民意基础，中国—中东欧国家合作（“16+1合作”）应运而生，方兴未艾。4年来，中国同中东欧国家一道，本着相互尊重、互利共赢、包容开放的原则，建机制、搭平台、促合作，共同推动“16+1合作”逐渐步入成熟期和早期收获期。中国同中东欧国家开展共建“一带一路”合作以及中欧不断加强战略对接，为“16+1合作”汇聚了更为蓬勃的动力，开辟了更为广阔的空间。, 欧盟是中国的全面战略伙伴。2014年3月，我访问欧盟总部期间，同欧方领导人一道决定打造中欧和平、增长、改革、文明四大伙伴关系，为新时期中欧关系指明了战略方向。2015年中欧建交40周年之际，双方决定推进“一带一路”倡议同欧洲投资计划等发展战略对接，组建中欧共同投资基金、互联互通平台等，进一步确立了中欧务实合作的新框架。中欧关系正处于历史发展最好时期，面临前所未有的历史机遇。, 当前，中欧双方都在推进结构性改革，激发经济社会发展活力。中国人民正在为全面建成小康社会、实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而不懈努力。不久前颁布实施的中国国民经济和社会发展第十三个五年规划纲要，贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念，致力于稳增长、转方式、调结构，努力在未来5年保持经济中高速增长。欧盟正致力于保持经济复苏势头，大力提升欧盟经济发展竞争力。在此背景下，中欧双方发展战略契合度高、合作潜力巨大、前景广阔。中国愿同欧盟一道，发扬同舟共济、合作共赢的精神，共同为世界经济发展贡献力量。, 中国—中东欧国家合作和中欧关系的发展需要依靠双边关系的有力支撑。当前，中捷两国面临着双边关系发展的重要历史机遇。我期待通过这次访问，同捷克领导人一道，提高双边关系水平，推动“16+1合作”以及中欧关系不断向前发展。, ——加强政治互信，指明发展方向。“求木之长者，必固其根本。”中捷双方应该适时提高双边关系定位，坚持从战略高度和长远角度看待双边关系，本着互相尊重、平等相待的原则，坚定支持对方的核心利益和重大关切，确保中捷关系长期健康稳定发展，牢牢把握两国关系发展的大方向。, ——加强战略对接，释放合作潜力。中捷双方应该以签署共同推进“一带一路”建设政府间谅解备忘录为重要契机，加强各自发展战略和愿景的对接，进一步梳理和筹备重大合作项目，争取早期收获。, ——加强经贸合作，惠及两国民众。经过30多年的改革开放，中国在资金、技术、装备方面已经形成较大优势，特别是在铁路、核电建设等领域优势明显。捷克位于欧洲心脏地带，地理位置优越，工业基础雄厚，在机械加工、汽车制造、航空等领域具有独特优势。中方愿同捷方一道，以制造业为基础推进产能合作，带动金融、通信、智能工业、纳米、环保等各领域务实合作，让两国民众分享更多互利合作成果。, ——加强人文交流，赋予时代内涵。中捷两国人民素来互相欣赏对方的文明、文化，近年来更是不断掀起交流高潮。我们要继续扩大文化、教育、影视、旅游、卫生等领域人文交流，鼓励青年和学生交往，让两国人民的传统友谊世代相传、历久弥新。, ——加强区域合作，用好广阔平台。捷克一直积极支持和参与中国—中东欧国家合作，在卫生、地方合作等方面一直走在中东欧国家前列，在“16+1合作”中发挥了积极重要作用。我们愿同包括捷克在内的中东欧国家一道，为做大做强“16+1合作”共同努力。, ——加强中欧合作，共建美好未来。中欧双方应当顺应和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流，不断深化各自发展战略对接，加强在国际舞台上的沟通和协调，携手努力，推动中欧全面战略伙伴关系不断迈上新台阶。, 让我们齐心协力，奏响中捷关系时代强音，共同创造中国—中东欧国家合作以及中欧关系更加美好的明天。, ]",习近平在捷克媒体发表署名文章《奏响中捷关系的时代强音》,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28229071
15,62,"[, On January 21, on a state visit to Iran, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Creating a Better Tomorrow in China-Iran Relations"" in the Iranian ""Iran"". The article is as follows:, To create a better tomorrow for China-Iran relations, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, I will pay a state visit to Iran at the invitation of President Rouhani, and exchange views on deepening China-Iran relations and major international and regional issues under the new situation. Pushing China-Iran relations to a new level. This is my first visit to Iran, but like many Chinese people, I am no stranger to your ancient and beautiful country, because the Silk Road has long linked our two great nations together. The history books record one wonderful story after another. As early as the Western Han Dynasty in China more than 2000 years ago, the deputy envoy of the Chinese messenger Zhang Qian came to Iran and received a grand reception. In the Tang and Song Dynasties of China after the 7th century, many Iranians went to China to study and practice medicine, and traveled to Xi'an, Guangzhou and other places. In the 13th century, the famous Iranian poet Sadie recorded an unforgettable trip to Kashi, Xinjiang, China. In the 15th century, Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led a huge fleet of ocean voyages seven times in the Ming Dynasty, three of which reached the Hormuz region of southern Iran. The combination of silk from China and the superb craftsmanship of Iran has achieved the nobleness of the Persian silk blanket; the combination of Su Ma Liqing from Iran and the superb craftsmanship of China has achieved the elegance of blue and white porcelain. China's lacquer ware, pottery and papermaking, metallurgy, printing, gunpowder and other technologies passed through Iran to the westernmost point of Asia and even farther away in Europe, and pomegranates, grapes, olives, glass, gold and silver ware, etc. were passed from Iran and Europe. Into China. , Camel bells heard each other, Zhou Zhou looked at each other. Along the thousands of kilometers of land and sea Silk Road, the two civilizations traveled and embraced, and the people of the two countries traveled and made friends. As Sadie wrote in the poem, ""For a long time, Fang deserves nostalgia."" If historically China and Iran have made important contributions to building the Silk Road and promoting the two-way integration of Eastern and Western civilizations, the friendly exchanges between the two countries in the 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations are precisely The inheritance and interpretation of the Silk Road spirit of ""mutual benefit and win-win"". Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1971, Sino-Iranian relations have withstood the test of international changes and maintained a healthy and stable development momentum. The two sides understand each other, trust each other, and share troubles. In the negotiation of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue, China appreciates Iran’s unintended commitment to develop nuclear weapons, supports Iran’s protection of its legitimate rights and interests, and fully affirms Iran’s positive contribution to the promotion of the agreement. In the next stage, we are willing to work closely with Iran to ensure the smooth implementation of the agreement. In terms of economy and trade, the bilateral trade volume between China and Iran has increased from tens of millions of US dollars in the 1970s to 51.8 billion US dollars in 2014. China has maintained Iran's largest trading partner status for 6 consecutive years. The humanities exchanges between the two countries are very close, ""there is no distance between each other, and thousands of miles are still neighbors."" The friendship between the two peoples has become an important driving force for the development of Sino-Iranian friendly relations. The leaders of the two countries maintain regular contacts and exchanges, which play an important role in leading the development of bilateral relations. In recent years, I have met with President Rohani many times, especially during the series of summits of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations last September. We reached an important consensus on the comprehensive development of China-Iran relations in the new era. , In 2013, I proposed to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, which received positive response from Iran. As two important stations on the ancient Silk Road, both China and Iran have high expectations for the revitalization of this road of peace, friendship, and cooperation. At present, China is formulating and implementing the 13th five-year plan for national economic and social development, and Iran is also about to advance the sixth five-year plan for economic development. The development strategies of the two sides are in line with each other, and the cooperation potential is huge. , I think the cooperation between China and Iran within the framework of the ""Belt and Road"" can be concentrated in the following areas. , ——Enhance political mutual trust and lay a solid foundation for cooperation. ""Believing is standing, but not believing is invalid."" People-to-people, country-to-country exchanges are unprecedented. The countries along the ancient Silk Road have accumulated trust, deepened friendship and promoted cooperation in more than 2,000 years of exchanges. In the 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Iran have overcome difficulties and resistance, the traditional friendship has lasted for a long time, and pragmatic cooperation has achieved fruitful results. Today, we must adhere to the above spirit, strengthen policy communication, take care of each other’s concerns, gather more consensus, and lay a more solid foundation for cooperation. We will establish a comprehensive strategic partnership, close exchanges between political parties, legislative bodies, and localities, deepen cooperation between the two sides within the multilateral frameworks of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, AsiaInfo, and the United Nations, and continue to increase political mutual trust and enrich the content of strategic relations. , ——Insist on mutual benefit and win-win and share prosperity and development. After more than 30 years of reform and opening up, China’sContinuously enhance political mutual trust and enrich the connotation of strategic relations. , ——Insist on mutual benefit and win-win and share prosperity and development. After more than 30 years of reform and opening up, China's economy has achieved historic development, and its economic aggregate ranks second in the world. China has formed a large advantage in terms of capital, technology and equipment. Iran is rich in resources, has sufficient labor force, and has great market potential. It is at a critical stage of promoting industrialization and modernization. Sino-Iranian resource endowments and cooperation advantages are highly complementary. With the conclusion and implementation of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue, China-Iran relations will usher in a new opportunity for development. China will uphold the concept of win-win cooperation, strengthen the integration of China-Iraq development strategies, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, each director and each do his best to benefit the people and achieve common prosperity. , ——Promote interconnection and expand pragmatic cooperation. Interconnection is the bloodline running through the “Belt and Road”. To achieve interconnection and interconnection, we must focus on Asian countries and use transportation infrastructure as a breakthrough. China has obvious advantages and strong competitiveness in the fields of railway, power, communications, engineering machinery, metallurgy, and building materials. In 2014, it invested 40 billion US dollars to establish the Silk Road Fund to support relevant cooperation projects in countries along the “Belt and Road”. Iran is located in the east-west transportation hub of Asia, and its geographical advantage is obvious. China is willing to deepen cooperation with Iran in the fields of highways, railways, sea routes, and networks, and promote the construction of East-West passages in Asia, so as to facilitate the trade and investment of countries along the route, reduce the cost of cross-border movement of people, commodities, and funds, and consolidate and expand energy resources. Cooperation with industry. , —— Adhere to openness and tolerance, and encourage exchanges between civilizations. The Chinese say: ""People know each other, but they have the heart to know each other."" The Persian proverb says: ""There is a road between people's hearts."" Different countries, different nationalities, and different civilizations should insist on exchanges and mutual learning and harmonious coexistence. Both Chinese and Iranian cultures have their own strengths. The Chinese and Iranian people learn from each other in the long-term friendly exchanges and learn from each other's strengths. We must strengthen exchanges in the fields of culture, education, journalism, publishing, tourism, and encourage youth and students to communicate with each other, let the spirit of the Silk Road be passed on, and let the people of the two countries communicate with each other and connect hands. , Dan Xuanjiexiu, Huashi and Li. Pomegranate has already settled down from Iran to China, and because of its fruits, it has been given a new meaning in China, symbolizing prosperity and prosperity. It has witnessed the history of friendly exchanges between the people of China and Iran along the Silk Road, and heralds that the cooperation between the two countries will yield more fruitful results. Beijing and Tehran are thousands of miles apart, but no matter how far they are, they cannot stop China and Iran from approaching each other, enhance cooperation, and prevent the friendly exchanges and deepening of friendship between the two peoples. We are willing to work together with Iran to inherit the spirit of the Silk Road and create a better tomorrow for China-Iran relations.

16,63,"[, On January 19, on a state visit to Egypt, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Let the China-Arab Friendship Run Like the Nile River"" in the Egyptian Pyramid. The article is as follows: Let the China-Arab Friendship flow forward like the Nile River, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Sisi, I will pay a state visit to Egypt. This is my first visit to the Middle East and Arab countries after being the President of China, and my first visit in 2016. I will discuss friendship, discuss cooperation and discuss development with friends from Egypt and Arabia. I look forward to this visit becoming a friendship, cooperation and win-win journey. , ""Egypt is a gift from the Nile."" When I visited Egypt for the first time 16 years ago, I saw on the ground that the ancient Egyptian people transformed the cyclical floods into an important resource for agricultural development. I realized that the Nile was the mother river that gave birth to Egyptian civilization. , And sincerely praise the wisdom and strength of the Egyptian people. , Since then, the magnificent Nile River has been deeply imprinted in my mind. Since the end of 2014, President Sisi and I have met in Beijing twice. The two sides have jointly decided to promote China-Egypt relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership and push China-Egypt relations into the fast lane of development. In September last year, President Sisi attended the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War in Beijing. On behalf of the Arab world, he issued a just cry for maintaining the victory of the Second World War and the post-war international order. China and Egypt are both ancient civilizations, and the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have a long history. More than 2,000 years ago, the Chinese Han Dynasty sent emissaries to Alexandria, and the ancient Silk Road became an important link between the two sides. Since modern times, the people of China and Egypt have responded in unison with each other in the struggle against colonization and hegemony. More than 60 years ago, at the Bandung Conference, the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai and President Nasser were tightly held together, and China and Egypt worked together to embark on a journey to jointly safeguard the rights and interests of the vast number of developing countries. During the years of Jiazi, Sino-Egyptian relations have undergone international and regional changes, and they have always developed healthily and steadily. The two sides understood and respected each other, trusted and supported each other, and conducted fruitful cooperation. China supports the Egyptian people’s independent determination of the country’s future and destiny, the Egyptian government’s efforts to restore social stability and economic development, and Egypt’s active role in regional and international affairs. , China will look at and develop relations with Egypt from a strategic and long-term perspective. I would like to work together with President Sisi to comprehensively deepen political mutual trust and strategic cooperation between the two countries, achieve common development and progress, and make China-Egypt relations a South-South cooperation. The model has further played a leading and demonstrative role. Egypt is the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with China. Sino-Egyptian relations are the starting point of China-Arab relations and represent the height and temperature of China-Arab relations. Over the past 60 years, China-Arab friendly cooperation has achieved a historic leap and accumulated valuable experience. The two sides insist on mutual respect and treat each other as equals. No matter how the international situation changes, they will always be friends, brothers and partners. Both sides insist on mutual benefit and win-win and common development. No matter what development changes they have undergone, they always pursue common interests and sustainable development. Both sides strive to promote dialogue and exchanges, learn from each other's civilizations, and always respect each other's social system and development path. We always adhere to the principles of mutual trust, mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and mutual prosperity in long-term exchanges and cooperation, and become good friends, good brothers, and good partners that we trust and rely on. Over the past 60 years, China-Arab relations have developed comprehensively and have achieved fruitful results. Collective cooperation between China and Arab countries has also gone through 11 springs and autumns. In 2014, I attended the opening ceremony of the 6th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum held in Beijing, proposed the strategic concept of the China-Arab Cooperation building the “Belt and Road”, and jointly planned with Arab friends the next 10 years of China-Arab relations Blueprint for development. China-Arab relations have shown vigorous vitality. So far, 8 countries including Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Sudan, Jordan, and Iraq have established or upgraded bilateral strategic cooperation (partnership) relations with China. In 2014, China-Arab trade exceeded US$251.1 billion, and China imported 146 million tons of crude oil from Arab countries, making it the second largest trading partner of Arab countries. Seven Arab countries became founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Over the past 60 years, China has provided 25.4 billion yuan in economic assistance to Arab countries, trained more than 20,000 personnel, and dispatched foreign aid medical teams to 8 countries. Eleven Arab countries have become Chinese citizens’ destinations for outbound tourism. China and Arab countries have 183 flights per week, with 1.02 million passengers per year. ,The Arab countries have become the destination countries for Chinese citizens to travel abroad. China and Arab countries have 183 flights per week and 1.02 million passengers per year. , Arabic proverb says “walk alone, travel far away”, Chinese people often say “friends have more ways to go”. This is a good way to describe that the two countries are moving forward together and walking together. Today, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, global challenges are increasing, the world economy is struggling to recover, and local turbulence is one after another. The threat of terrorism is clearly rising, and it is more urgent than ever to build a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation. Now, both China and Arab countries are at a critical stage of their development. The Chinese people are striving to build a well-off society in an all-round way and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The people of Arab countries are also independently exploring the path of change and striving to achieve national rejuvenation. The common development mission and ideal pursuit have brought China and Afghanistan closer together. The total land area of ​​China and Arab countries accounts for 1/6 of the world's total land area, and the total population accounts for 1/4 of the world's total population. Both sides have great potential for cooperation and broad prospects. Looking into the future, we will continue to work to promote the comprehensive cooperation and common development of China-Arab strategic cooperative relations, so that the traditional friendship between China and Arab countries will be handed down, so that China-Arab cooperation will benefit both ordinary people. , ——China and Argentina should be practitioners of the path of independent development. There is no one-size-fits-all panacea in the world, nor a universal development model. No one knows the historical latitude and longitude of the Middle East better than the people of the Middle East, and knows where to go in the Middle East. Only by insisting on taking your own path can the road become wider and longer and longer. The Arab people’s longing for a better life is both a driving force for reform and a foundation for regional stability. China is willing to support Egypt and other Arab countries to follow the development path of their own national conditions, share development experience, and meet the challenges of the times. -China and Afghanistan will be the defenders of regional peace. The Middle East is unstable and the world is not peaceful. Throughout history, force has never been a good solution to the problem, and the logic of zero-sum game and winner-take-all is incompatible with this era. Seeking common ground while reserving differences and forgiving mutual understanding is the fundamental way to seek the greatest common interest of all parties. China will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. China will provide more public goods and work side by side with Egypt and other Arab countries to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East. , ——China and Afghanistan will be promoters of mutually beneficial cooperation. The “Belt and Road” pursues the great profits of a hundred flowers blooming, not the unique profits. China has a vast market, ample capital, advanced technology, and advantageous production capacity. It has put forward the development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness, and sharing. Arab countries are at a critical stage of the modernization process, and industrialization is generally regarded as an important choice for promoting development, improving people's livelihood, and increasing employment. The two sides can jointly build up the “Belt and Road” and connect their respective development strategies to deepen and expand cooperation in the fields of energy, trade and investment, infrastructure construction, and high technology. We welcome Egypt and other Arab countries to take the free rides and express trains developed by China to achieve coordinated development and joint growth. , ——China and Afghanistan should be advocates of cultural diversity. The Chinese civilization and the Arab Islamic civilization each have their own characteristics and become one. We appreciate each other and learn from each other. With respect and humility, we learn from and absorb the essence of each other’s culture, and provide a vivid example for the exchange and mutual learning of world civilizations. We are willing to work tirelessly with Egypt and other Arab countries to inherit traditional culture and maintain the diversity of civilizations. The ancient Egyptians praised the Nile River like this: ""You are gushing out of the earth and running endlessly."" I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Egypt friendship and China-Arab friendship will also rush forward like the Nile waters and help us Realize the great dream of national rejuvenation!

17,64,"[, On January 18, on a state visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Being a Good Partner for Common Development"" in the Saudi Riyadh newspaper. The article is as follows: To be a good partner for common development, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia is the first stop of my first visit this year and the first Arab country I visited after becoming the Chinese President. , Saudi Arabia is a brother country of China. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, people think of the unique oil and gas treasures of the ""oil kingdom"", the long history of the birthplace of Islam, and the magnificence of the desert sunset. In 2008, I visited Saudi Arabia as the Vice President of China. Saudi Arabia's national construction is prosperous. The people are hospitable and hospitable, leaving a good impression on me. After 8 years, at the invitation of King Salman, I will set foot on this beautiful and fertile land with the Chinese people's friendship for the Saudi people and the expectation of developing Sino-Saudi friendly relations. , The Chinese say that suffering is true. There is a saying in Saudi Arabia: ""It is the greatest good deed to reach out to those who are eager for help."" After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China, Saudi Arabia provided China with more than US$60 million in cash and material assistance for the first time. This is China. The largest single overseas aid received by the government. The assistance of the Saudi government and people is a vivid expression of China-Saudi friendship. The Chinese people are deeply moved and will always remember it forever. The friendly exchanges between the people of China and Saudi Arabia have a long history. More than 2,000 years ago, on the ancient Silk Road, the camel team between the two sides continued. During the Tang Dynasty in China, the great food country sent envoys to China. The Chinese Ming Dynasty Muslim navigator Zheng He sailed to Jeddah, Mecca, Medina and other places, praising the ""folk customs and beauty"" wherever he went, and ""sincerity is the world of bliss"". The mutual learning between Chinese civilization and Islamic civilization has left a deep mark in the history of human civilization exchanges. , The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Saudi Arabia in 1990 opened a new chapter in bilateral relations. Especially since the establishment of strategic friendly relations in 2008, China-Saudi Arabia relations have achieved leapfrog development, and pragmatic cooperation in various fields has reached an unprecedented breadth and depth. Saudi Arabia has been China’s largest supplier of crude oil in the world and its largest trading partner in West Asia and Africa for many years. In 2013, China became the largest trading partner of Saudi Arabia for the first time. In 2014, the bilateral trade volume between China and Saudi Arabia increased more than 230 times compared with when the establishment of diplomatic relations reached US$69.1 billion. Today, for every 6 barrels of crude oil imported by China, 1 barrel comes from Saudi Arabia, and for every 7 rials of Saudi exports, 1 rial comes from China. The cooperation projects between China and Saudi Arabia in infrastructure construction, investment, labor service, agriculture and other fields are numerous, and the scale of cooperation is continuously expanding. The light rail project laid by the Chinese company in the holy city of Mecca provides convenient services for Muslim hajj from all over the world. The Chinese company developed the Hajj communication guarantee program, which has ensured smooth communication during the Hajj for many years. The scientific research institutions of China and Saudi Arabia have successfully mapped the date palm genome, which has an important impact on the output, variety improvement, and pest control of date palm. , People-to-people exchanges between China and Saudi Arabia are getting closer. At the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, the ""Silk Road Treasure Ship"" carefully crafted by Saudi Arabia is one of the most popular venues, and the visitors still continue to visit today. In 2013, China participated as the guest of honor in the Genedea Heritage Cultural Festival in Saudi Arabia, and showed the Saudi people a vibrant China with both traditional cultural heritage and modern development and innovation. , ""The confidants in the sea and the neighbors are close to each other."" Increasingly close friendly cooperation has brought the hearts of the two peoples closer together. The Sino-Saudi relations are brilliant and give us many useful experiences and enlightenment. In my opinion, mutual respect, mutual trust and equality are the solid foundation for the healthy and stable development of China-Saudi Arabia relations; complementary advantages and mutual benefit are the strong driving force for the long-term benefit of the two peoples; the frank meeting and the mutual love are the long-lasting friendship between China and Saudi Arabia The inexhaustible source of renewal. Throughout the respective economic and social development processes of China and Saudi Arabia, we have found that both countries are based on their national conditions and take a development path that suits them; both focus on the long-term and promote sustainable and diversified economic development; both are people-oriented and continue to improve people's living standards. The highly compatible development concept has opened up vast space for the development of bilateral relations. At present, the Chinese people are making unremitting efforts to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Saudi Arabia has also begun to implement a new five-year plan, which is committed to promoting a diversified economic development strategy and achieving comprehensive, balanced and coordinated development of the country. The similar development demands, the same development mission, and the integration of development benefits provide a lasting impetus for the deep development of Sino-Saudi relations. China and Saudi Arabia are countries with important influence and face important historical opportunities to promote the development of bilateral relations. I look forward toProvides a lasting impetus to deep development. China and Saudi Arabia are countries with important influence and face important historical opportunities to promote the development of bilateral relations. Through this visit, I look forward to working with Saudi leaders to raise the level of bilateral relations and promote the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries to a deeper and higher level to better benefit the two peoples. , ——We want to be a strategic partner of mutual support and sincerity and mutual trust. Both sides should grasp the general direction of bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, strengthen the connection of national development strategies, understand and support each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and consolidate political mutual trust. ——We are to be mutually beneficial partners for win-win cooperation and common development. The two sides should expand the scale of bilateral trade, build a long-term and stable energy cooperation community between China and Saudi Arabia, strengthen cooperation in infrastructure construction and investment, and use the three high-tech fields of aerospace, peaceful use of nuclear energy and renewable energy as breakthroughs to enrich China-Saudi pragmatic cooperation. content. China appreciates Saudi Arabia's intention to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as a founding member. It is also willing to work with Saudi Arabia to accelerate the construction of the China-Gulf Cooperation Council free trade zone, so as to form a good interaction between bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation, and continuously improve mutual benefits between the two countries. Level of cooperation. , ——We are to be partners in the same boat together. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Saudi Arabia in multilateral fields, maintain regional peace and stability and promote common development. In order to promote regional interconnection and common development, China has proposed the idea of ​​jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. We hope and believe that Saudi Arabia, located at the intersection of the “Belt and Road” West, will become an important participant, builder and beneficiary of the “Belt and Road” initiative. ——We are to be friendly partners with close contacts and exchanges and mutual learning. Friends get deeper and deeper. China is willing to expand exchanges and cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the fields of education, news, think tanks, youth and other fields, and strengthen cultural exchanges at all levels. Welcome more Saudi friends to take a walk around China and take a look, each of you can become a messenger to spread China-Saudi friendship. , Let us work together to create a better tomorrow for China-Saudi relations.

18,110,"[, Mr. Bustamante, representatives from the Asia-Pacific business community, ladies and gentlemen, friends:, I am very happy to meet you in beautiful Lima. China and Peru are far apart. The English-Chinese Dictionary has a word called ""From China to Peru"", which means to travel all over the world. Today, we came to Lima not far away. The common goal is to discuss ideas and measures to promote the development of the Asia-Pacific region. Two months ago, the G20 Hangzhou Summit was successfully held. I have worked with leaders of various countries to discuss in depth the outstanding issues facing the world economy and have formed many important consensuses. It is generally believed that the global economic recovery is still weak, the growth momentum is insufficient, economic globalization has encountered setbacks, trade and investment have been sluggish, and global challenges have exacerbated the uncertainty of the world economy. Faced with risks and challenges, all parties should carry forward the spirit of partnership for mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, strengthen macro-policy coordination, innovate economic growth methods, build an open world economy, and promote strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. At present, the Asia-Pacific region generally maintains a balanced development trend, but it also faces challenges and is at a critical juncture for development. As the largest and most dynamic region in the global economy, the Asia-Pacific region must have the courage to play a leading role, take strong and coordinated actions, inject new impetus into the world economic recovery, and open up new paths for world economic growth. First, promote economic integration and build an open economy. Openness is the lifeline of the Asia-Pacific economy. For more than 20 years, APEC members have been adhering to trade liberalization and facilitation. The average annual growth of trade volume is 8%, which is more than twice the growth rate of the economy during the same period, which provides a stable impetus for Asia-Pacific economic growth. In recent years, the development of international trade has entered a downturn. The World Trade Organization predicts that global trade growth this year may be lower than the economic growth rate for the fifth consecutive year. The Asia-Pacific region faces the same pressure and urgently needs to resolve challenges such as the fragmentation of regional economic cooperation. For any regional trade arrangement to gain broad support, it must adhere to openness, tolerance, inclusiveness and win-win results. We should build a regional cooperation framework of equal consultation, joint participation, and universal benefit. Closed and exclusive arrangements are not the right choice. The construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area is a strategic move concerning the long-term prosperity of the Asia-Pacific. Friends from the business community call it the ""APEC Dream"". We must resolutely promote the construction of the Asia-Pacific free trade zone and provide institutional guarantee for the Asia-Pacific open economy. It is necessary to revive the role of the engine of trade and investment, enhance the openness and inclusiveness of free trade arrangements, and maintain the multilateral trading system. At present, there are many discussions around economic globalization, and there are both supporters and doubters. Generally speaking, economic globalization conforms to economic laws and the interests of all parties. At the same time, economic globalization is a double-edged sword, which not only provides strong momentum for global development, but also brings some new situations and new challenges, which need to be seriously faced. A new round of science and technology and industrial revolution is gestating, the international division of labor system is accelerating, and the global value chain is being deeply reshaped. These all give new connotation to economic globalization. APEC was established in a period of continuous economic globalization, and the development achievements made by the Asia-Pacific are inseparable from economic globalization. We must recognize and grasp the interactive changes of our own development and the external environment, capture new opportunities, position new roles, and create new advantages. At the same time, globalization also raises new issues that require in-depth research. We must actively guide the direction of economic globalization, work hard to solve the problem of fairness and justice, and make the process of economic globalization more dynamic, more inclusive, and more sustainable, and increase the sense of participation of the general public. , A sense of gain, happiness. , Second, promote interconnection and interconnection to achieve joint development. Interconnection is an important means to unleash the potential for development, and it is also the basic premise for achieving linked development. We must promote the establishment of a comprehensive and integrated interconnected network covering the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year, the APEC meeting returned to Latin America after an interval of eight years. We must seize this opportunity to promote the interconnection of the two sides of the Pacific to connect with each other, and radiate and promote the development of the real economy in a wider range. It is necessary to deeply implement the interconnection blueprint formulated by the Beijing Conference, improve the trinity interconnection architecture of infrastructure, rules and regulations, and personnel exchanges to ensure the goal of full connectivity by 2025. 3 years ago, I proposed the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, which is to focus on interconnection, promote the free and convenient flow of production factors, create a multiple cooperation platform, and achieve win-win and shared development. Up to now, a total of more than 100 countries and international organizations have actively participated in and supported them, forming a circle of like-minded, friendly and trustworthy and energetic ""friends."" The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank opened and operated, the Silk Road Fund was successfully established, and a large number of major projects were put into practice, which produced huge economic and social benefits. China will work with all parties to uphold mutual consultation,The operation of the industry, the smooth establishment of the Silk Road Fund, and the implementation of a large number of major projects have produced huge economic and social benefits. China will work with all parties to uphold the principles of mutual consultation, co-construction and sharing, promote policy communication, road connectivity, smooth trade, currency circulation, and people-to-people connections, achieve development strategy integration, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and inject regional economic development and people's livelihood improvement Powerful. We welcome all parties to participate in cooperation, share opportunities, meet challenges and seek common development. , Third, promote reform and innovation and enhance endogenous power. With the development of the Asia-Pacific region today, every step must be driven by reform and vitality from innovation. Reform and innovation are good and difficult. As the old Chinese saying goes: ""It's easy to get things done, but be brave."" Latin American proverbs say, ""There is no greater difficulty than lack of will."" In 2014, APEC leaders approved the ""Consensus on Economic Innovation Development, Reform, and Growth"" in Beijing, indicating the direction for the Asia-Pacific region to take the path of innovation and development. This year, the G20 Hangzhou Summit adopted the ""Innovation Growth Blueprint"", emphasizing the importance of reform and innovation and formulating specific action plans. All members of the Asia-Pacific region should implement these consensuses and principles, promote the transformation of development methods, and make up their minds to use reform to promote economic restructuring and increase total factor productivity. We must strengthen macro-policy coordination, firmly promote structural reforms, and strengthen the positive spillover effect. It is necessary to accelerate innovation in development concepts, models and paths, stimulate social creativity and market vitality, promote industries and products to leapfrog into the mid- and high-end of the global value chain, and expand new development space. , Fourth, promote win-win cooperation and deepen partnership. Partnership is an important link in Asia-Pacific cooperation and an inevitable choice for jointly meeting current challenges. Everyone thinks that the 21st century is an Asia-Pacific century, but happiness will not fall from the sky. Two years ago, APEC leaders reviewed the 25-year history of cooperation and proposed guiding principles for building an Asia-Pacific partnership. Last year, we emphasized in Manila that we must uphold the idea of ​​Asia-Pacific partnership and promote the spirit of mutual trust, tolerance, cooperation and win-win results. , We must deepen the consciousness of the community of destiny, and let each other get closer and closer, not gradually away. To continuously enhance the depth and breadth of regional cooperation, jointly build platforms, jointly formulate rules, and share development results, we should never dismantle and mutually exclude each other. Equal participation, full consultation, mutual assistance and common development are required, and efforts are made to create a healthy and stable development environment without allowing any factors to interfere with the development process of the Asia-Pacific region. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! To achieve common development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, cooperation at the regional level needs to be strengthened and every member needs to take action. As the most populous developing country, China has maintained steady and healthy economic development, which has vigorously spurred economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. In the years following the outbreak of the international financial crisis, China contributed nearly 40% of the increase in the global economy, and played an important role in supporting the recovery of the world economy. In recent years, against the background of weak global economic growth, the Chinese economy has encountered some difficulties and challenges. We are firm in confidence and take the initiative to adjust. The economic growth rate is still in the forefront of major economies, and the contribution rate to world economic growth remains above 25%. This year is the beginning of China's ""Thirteenth Five-Year Plan"". We actively adapt to and lead the new normal of economic development, adhere to comprehensive deepening of reforms, adhere to innovation-driven development, accelerate the transformation of economic development mode and adjust economic structure, and the economy operates within a reasonable range . In the first three quarters, China’s economic growth rate was 6.7%, and the final consumption expenditure contributed 71% of GDP growth. The value added of the tertiary industry accounted for 52.8% of GDP. Energy consumption per unit of GDP The year-on-year decrease was 5.2%, and there were 10.67 million new urban jobs. The income gap between urban and rural residents continued to narrow. The quality and efficiency of China's economic development are constantly improving, new power is being strengthened, new formats are constantly emerging, and many industries in many regions are undergoing gratifying changes, and favorable factors are accumulating. , China is in the stage of winning a comprehensively well-off society. We are guided by the five development concepts of innovation, coordination, green, openness, and sharing. With supply-side structural reform as the main line, we will cultivate new economic structures and strengthen new development momentum. Promote the steady and healthy development of China's economy. Now and in the future, China will focus on the following measures to promote economic development. , First, focus on advancing supply-side structural reforms and accelerate the transformation of economic development methods. We will comprehensively deepen the reform of the economic system, strive to improve the system, and make the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government. While moderately expanding total demand, we use reform to promote structural adjustment, promote industrial optimization and reorganization, optimize factor allocation, enhance the adaptability and flexibility of the supply structure to changes in demand, and provide endogenous endogenous sources for sustained and healthy economic development. power. , Second, focus on promoting innovation and developmentThe adaptability and flexibility of the structure to changes in demand provide endogenous endogenous power for sustained and healthy economic development. Second, focus on promoting innovation and development, and realizing the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. We will adhere to the innovation-driven development strategy, deepen the reform of the scientific and technological system, break down ideological barriers and institutional barriers, promote the deep integration of science and technology and economic and social development, and let all sources of innovation fully flow. We will accelerate the in-depth integration of industry, university and research institutes, so that institutions, talents, markets, and funds will be fully activated, forming a strong vitality for promoting innovation and development. We will promote the vigorous development of new technologies, new industries, and new formats, transform innovative achievements into tangible economic activities, and cultivate new impetus for development. , Third, focus on promoting high-level two-way opening up, and insist on mutual benefit and win-win results. I have emphasized many times that the door to China’s opening will never be closed, it will only be opened. We will implement a more proactive opening strategy and create a more comprehensive, deeper, and more diversified opening pattern. We will increase the relaxation of foreign investment access, promote the construction of a domestic high-level and high-standard free trade pilot zone, improve the business environment of rule of law, convenience, and internationalization, and promote domestic and foreign enterprises to be treated equally and fairly. I believe that with the continuous advancement of a series of major reform measures, China's soft investment environment will be more open, more relaxed, and more transparent, creating more favorable conditions for foreign companies to share China's development opportunities. We will encourage more companies to go out, expand foreign investment, and build a new platform for mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation. We will deeply participate in the process of economic globalization, support the multilateral trading system, advance the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, and promote the conclusion of negotiations on regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements as soon as possible. Fourth, focus on shared development and green development, and improve people's well-being. An old Chinese saying: ""Govern the country is permanent, and benefit the people first."" The Peruvian proverb says: ""The voice of the people is the voice of heaven."" In order to conform to the people's longing for a better life, it is necessary to share the fruits of development with the people. We will improve the redistribution adjustment mechanism, divide the cake while making the cake bigger, and expand the middle-income group. We will vigorously advance the fight against poverty, and ensure that 55.75 million rural poor people will all be lifted out of poverty by 2020. We will further promote the building of a healthy China and provide people with life-cycle health and wellness services. Green water and green mountains are Jinshan and Yinshan. We will adhere to the sustainable development strategy, promote green and low-carbon recycling development, build a beautiful China with sky blue, green land and clear water, so that the people can truly feel the ecological benefits brought by development. The prospects for China's economic development are bright. China's development is an opportunity for the world. It is estimated that in the next five years, China's total imports will reach 8 trillion US dollars, the total amount of foreign investment utilized will reach 600 billion US dollars, the total foreign investment will reach 750 billion US dollars, and outbound tourism will reach 700 million passengers. This will provide countries around the world with a broader market, more sufficient capital, richer products, and more valuable opportunities for cooperation. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! 25 years ago, China officially became a member of APEC. In the past 25 years, China has been in the same boat with its members. It is a road of development and common prosperity. It is a road of continuous opening and deep integration. It is a road of forging ahead, courageous innovation, and mutual respect. , The road of common development. China is stepping towards the Asia-Pacific, and the Asia-Pacific is also stepping towards China. China has become the major trading partner and export market for the vast majority of APEC members. Everyone knows that Latin America is the origin of potato crops such as sweet potatoes. I have cited examples of sweet potatoes for some Chinese entrepreneurs. The sweet potato vines extend in all directions, but its tubers always grow on the base. For the same reason, no matter how far it develops, China will take root in the Asia-Pacific region, build the Asia-Pacific region, and benefit the Asia-Pacific region. China is unswervingly following the path of peaceful development, pursuing an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, while actively pursuing its own development and actively promoting the common development of Asia-Pacific countries, creating more opportunities for the people of the region. The business sector is the most active force in the global economy and the main force driving reform, development and innovation. I hope that everyone can stand up to the tide and take positive actions to achieve a win-win situation in cooperation, harvest fruits through hard work, and make new contributions to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific and even the world. , Finally, I wish this summit of business leaders a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Lima, November 19), ""People's Daily"" (November 21, 2016, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the APEC Business Leaders Summit,4381,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-11-21,"[, 布斯塔曼特主席先生，, 亚太工商界各位代表，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴同大家相会在美丽的利马。中国和秘鲁相距遥远，《英汉大词典》有一个词语，叫“从中国到秘鲁”，意思是走遍天下。今天，我们不远万里来到利马，共同的目标是探讨推进亚太发展思路和举措。, 两个月前，二十国集团领导人杭州峰会成功举行。我同各国领导人一道，深入讨论世界经济面临的突出问题，形成许多重要共识。大家普遍认为，全球经济复苏仍然乏力，增长动力不足，经济全球化遇到波折，贸易和投资低迷，全球性挑战加剧世界经济不确定性。面对风险和挑战，各方要发扬同舟共济、合作共赢的伙伴精神，加强宏观政策协调，创新经济增长方式，构建开放型世界经济，推动强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长。, 当前，亚太总体保持平衡发展态势，但也面临挑战，处在发展关键当口。作为全球经济规模最大、最具发展活力的地区，亚太要勇于担当，发挥引领作用，采取有力协调行动，为世界经济复苏注入新动力，为世界经济增长开辟新道路。, 第一，促进经济一体化，建设开放型经济。开放是亚太经济的生命线。20多年来，亚太经合组织成员坚持贸易自由化和便利化，贸易量年均增长8%，是同期经济增速的两倍多，为亚太经济增长提供了稳定动力。近年来，国际贸易发展进入低迷期。世界贸易组织预计，今年全球贸易增幅可能连续第五年低于经济增速。亚太面临相同压力，也亟待解决区域经济合作碎片化等挑战。任何区域贸易安排要获得广泛支持，必须坚持开放、包容、普惠、共赢。我们应该构建平等协商、共同参与、普遍受益的区域合作框架，封闭和排他性安排不是正确选择。, 建设亚太自由贸易区，是事关亚太长远繁荣的战略举措，工商界朋友称之为“亚太经合组织之梦”。我们要坚定推进亚太自由贸易区建设，为亚太开放型经济提供制度保障。要重振贸易和投资的引擎作用，增强自由贸易安排开放性和包容性，维护多边贸易体制。, 当前，围绕经济全球化有很多讨论，支持者有之，质疑者亦有之。总体而言，经济全球化符合经济规律，符合各方利益。同时，经济全球化是一把双刃剑，既为全球发展提供强劲动能，也带来一些新情况新挑战，需要认真面对。新一轮科技和产业革命正孕育兴起，国际分工体系加速演变，全球价值链深度重塑，这些都给经济全球化赋予新的内涵。亚太经合组织成立于经济全球化不断推进的时期，亚太取得的发展成就同经济全球化密不可分。我们要认识和把握自身发展和外部环境的互动变化，捕捉新机遇，定位新角色，创立新优势。同时，全球化也提出需要深入研究的新问题，我们要积极引导经济全球化发展方向，着力解决公平公正问题，让经济全球化进程更有活力、更加包容、更可持续，增强广大民众参与感、获得感、幸福感。, 第二，促进互联互通，实现联动发展。互联互通是释放发展潜力的重要手段，也是实现联动发展的基础前提。我们要推动建立覆盖整个亚太的全方位、复合型互联互通网络。今年，亚太经合组织会议时隔8年重回拉美举行，我们要把握这一契机，推动太平洋两岸互联互通建设彼此对接，在更广范围内辐射和带动实体经济发展。要深入落实北京会议制定的互联互通蓝图，完善基础设施、制度规章、人员交流三位一体的互联互通架构，确保2025年实现全面联接的目标。, 3年前，我提出“一带一路”倡议，就是要以互联互通为着力点，促进生产要素自由便利流动，打造多元合作平台，实现共赢和共享发展。截至目前，共有100多个国家和国际组织积极参与和支持，结成志同道合、互信友好、充满活力的“朋友圈”。亚洲基础设施投资银行开业运营，丝路基金顺利组建，一大批重大项目付诸实施，产生巨大经济社会效益。中国将同各方一道，秉持共商、共建、共享原则，推进政策沟通、道路联通、贸易畅通、货币流通、民心相通，实现发展战略对接，深化互利合作，为区域经济发展和民生改善注入强大动力。我们欢迎各方参与到合作中来，共享机遇，共迎挑战，共谋发展。, 第三，促进改革创新，增强内生动力。亚太发展到今天，每迈出一步都要向改革要动力，向创新要活力。改革创新是好事，也是难事。中国古语说：“遇事无难易，而勇于敢为。”拉美谚语说，“没有比缺乏意志更大的困难”。2014年，亚太经合组织领导人在北京批准《经济创新发展、改革与增长共识》，为亚太地区走创新发展之路指明了方向。今年，二十国集团领导人杭州峰会通过《创新增长蓝图》，强调改革创新的重要意义，制定具体行动计划。, 亚太各成员要落实好这些共识和原则，推进发展方式转变，下决心用改革推进经济结构调整，提高全要素生产率。要加强宏观政策协调，坚定推进结构性改革，强化正面溢出效应。要加快发展理念、模式、路径创新，激发社会创造力和市场活力，推动产业和产品向全球价值链中高端跃升，拓展发展新空间。, 第四，促进合作共赢，深化伙伴关系。伙伴关系是亚太合作的重要纽带，也是共同应对当前挑战的必然选择。大家都认为21世纪是亚太世纪，但幸福不会从天而降。两年前，亚太经合组织领导人回顾25年合作历程，提出构建亚太伙伴关系的指导原则。去年，我们在马尼拉强调，要秉持亚太伙伴关系理念，发扬互信、包容、合作、共赢的精神。, 我们要深化命运共同体意识，让彼此越走越近，而非渐行渐远。要不断提升区域合作的深度和广度，共同搭建平台，共同制定规则，共享发展成果，绝不应该相互拆台、相互排斥。要平等参与、充分协商，要相互帮助、共同发展，全力营造健康稳定的发展环境，不让任何因素干扰亚太发展进程。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 实现亚太共同发展繁荣，需要加强区域层面合作，更需要每一个成员付出行动。作为人口最多的发展中国家，中国保持经济平稳健康发展，有力带动了亚太和全球经济增长。国际金融危机爆发后的几年间，中国为全球经济贡献了接近40%的增量，对世界经济复苏起到重要支撑作用。近年来，在世界经济增长乏力的背景下，中国经济遇到一些困难和挑战。我们坚定信心、主动调整，经济增速仍然位居主要经济体前列，对世界经济增长的贡献率保持在25%以上。, 今年是中国实施“十三五”规划开局之年，我们积极适应和引领经济发展新常态，坚持全面深化改革，坚持创新驱动发展，加快经济发展方式转变和经济结构调整，经济运行在合理区间。前三季度，中国经济增速为6.7%，最终消费支出对国内生产总值增长贡献率达到71%，第三产业增加值占国内生产总值比重上升至52.8%，单位国内生产总值能耗同比下降5.2%，新增城镇就业1067万人，城乡居民收入差距继续缩小。中国经济发展质量和效益不断提升，新动力正在强化，新业态不断出现，很多地区很多产业都在发生可喜变革，有利因素进一步累积。, 中国正处在全面建成小康社会决胜阶段，我们以创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享五大发展理念为指引，以供给侧结构性改革为主线，培育新的经济结构，强化新的发展动能，推动中国经济平稳健康发展。, 当前和今后一个时期，中国将着力从以下方面采取措施推动经济发展。, 第一，着力推进供给侧结构性改革，加快转变经济发展方式。我们将全面深化经济体制改革，努力健全制度体系，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用和更好发挥政府作用。我们在适度扩大总需求的同时，用改革的办法推进结构调整，促进产业优化重组，优化要素配置，增强供给结构对需求变化的适应性和灵活性，为经济持续健康发展提供源源不断的内生动力。, 第二，着力促进创新发展，实现新旧动能转换。我们将坚持创新驱动发展战略，深化科技体制改革，破除思想障碍和制度藩篱，推动科技和经济社会发展深度融合，让一切创新源泉充分涌流。我们将加快产学研深度融合，让机构、人才、市场、资金都充分活跃起来，形成推进创新发展的强大活力。我们将推动新技术、新产业、新业态蓬勃发展，使创新成果转变为实实在在的经济活动，培育发展新动力。, 第三，着力推进高水平双向开放，坚持互利共赢。我多次强调，中国开放的大门永远不会关上，只会越开越大。我们将实行更加积极主动的开放战略，创造更全面、更深入、更多元的对外开放格局。我们将加大放宽外商投资准入，推进国内高水平高标准自由贸易试验区建设，完善法治化、便利化、国际化的营商环境，促进内外资企业一视同仁、公平竞争。我相信，随着一系列重大改革举措的持续推进，中国投资软环境将更开放、更宽松、更透明，为外资企业分享中国发展机遇创造更为有利的条件。我们将鼓励更多企业走出去，扩大对外投资，搭建互利共赢合作新平台。我们将深入参与经济全球化进程，支持多边贸易体制，推进亚太自由贸易区建设，推动区域全面经济伙伴关系协定尽早结束谈判。, 第四，着力实现共享发展、绿色发展，增进人民福祉。中国古语说：“治国有常，而利民为本。”秘鲁谚语说：“人民的声音就是上天的声音。”顺应人民群众对美好生活的向往，就要做到发展成果由人民共享。我们将完善再分配调节机制，在做大蛋糕的同时分好蛋糕，扩大中等收入群体。我们将大力推进脱贫攻坚战，在2020年前确保现行标准下5575万农村贫困人口全部脱贫。我们将深入推进健康中国建设，为人民提供全生命周期的卫生与健康服务。绿水青山就是金山银山，我们将坚持可持续发展战略，推动绿色低碳循环发展，建设天蓝、地绿、水清的美丽中国，让人民切实感受到发展带来的生态效益。, 中国经济发展前景是光明的。中国发展是世界的机遇。预计未来5年，中国进口总额将达到8万亿美元，利用外资总额将达到6000亿美元，对外投资总额将达到7500亿美元，出境旅游将达到7亿人次。这将为世界各国提供更广阔的市场、更充足的资本、更丰富的产品、更宝贵的合作契机。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 25年前，中国正式成为亚太经合组织成员。25年里，中国同各成员风雨同舟，携手走过的是一条聚焦发展、共谋繁荣之路，是一条持续开放、深度融合之路，是一条锐意进取、勇敢创新之路，是一条互敬互助、共同发展之路。中国一步步走向亚太，亚太也一步步走向中国，中国已经成为绝大多数亚太经合组织成员主要贸易伙伴和出口市场。, 大家都知道，拉美是地瓜等薯类作物的原产地。我曾给中国一些企业家举过地瓜的例子。地瓜的藤蔓向四面八方延伸，但它的块茎始终长在根基位置。同样道理，无论发展到什么程度，中国都将扎根亚太、建设亚太、造福亚太。中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，奉行互利共赢的开放战略，在谋求自身发展的同时积极带动亚太国家共同发展，为本地区人民创造更多机遇。, 工商界是全球经济最活跃的力量，是推动改革、发展、创新的主力军。希望大家勇立潮头、积极行动，在合作中实现共赢，在耕耘中收获果实，为亚太乃至全球经济发展作出新贡献。, 最后，我祝愿这次工商领导人峰会取得圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社利马11月19日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年11月21日 03 版）, ]",习近平在亚太经合组织工商领导人峰会上的主旨演讲,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28882468
19,111,"[, On June 21, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Uzbekistan and attending the sixteenth meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, State President Xi Jinping was in Uzbekistan’s People’s Remarks and the “Zahon” news agency website Published a signed article entitled ""Writing the Sino-Ukrainian Friendship Xinhua Chapter"". The article reads as follows:, Writing the Sino-Ukrainian Friendship Xinhua Chapter, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, ""Green Fields and Grass, Empty Mountains, Snow and Silver."" This is a poem written by Chinese officials from the Ming Dynasty to Central Asia more than 600 years ago. The magnificent scenery of Uzbekistan has been known and yearned by the Chinese since ancient times. In September 2013, I visited beautiful Uzbekistan for the first time. I was deeply impressed by the unique natural scenery, thousands of years of history and culture, and hard-working and intelligent people. In this lush season, at the invitation of President Karimov, I will visit Uzbekistan again and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tashkent Summit. I am looking forward to this trip. The Chinese and Ukrainian people are industrious and courageous, honest and upholding their commitments, emphasizing the importance of love and meaning, and they have a similar understanding of their country. More than 2,000 years ago, the ancient Silk Road connected China and Uzbekistan and the peoples of the two countries, and opened the curtain of friendship between the two sides. The works and ideas of Uzbekistan’s historical and cultural celebrities such as Zhang Qian of the Western Han Dynasty, Xuan Zang of the Tang Dynasty, and Chen Cheng of the Ming Dynasty have traveled or passed through Uzbekistan. Navoi, Wulubo, Hualazimi and other Uzbekistan historical and cultural celebrities have spread in China. Chinese and Western cultures blended together in Central Asia, and Uzbekistan played an important role as a bridge. For thousands of years, China has maintained close ties with Uzbekistan and formed an excellent tradition of mutual exchanges, laying a solid foundation for today's good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Ukraine. Uzbekistan is a big country in Central Asia. China has always viewed China-Ukraine relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective. At the beginning of Uzbekistan's independence, China took the lead in establishing diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan. Over the past 24 years, China-Ukraine relations have withstood the test of time and international changes, and maintained a healthy and stable development momentum. The two sides firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests, and cooperation in various fields has achieved fruitful results. Since 2013, President Karimov and I have maintained close exchanges through meetings, telephone conversations, and exchange of letters to establish a good working relationship and deep personal friendship. The two sides signed important documents such as the China-Ukraine Friendship and Cooperation Treaty and the China-Ukraine Strategic Partnership Development Plan from 2014 to 2018. The political and legal basis of the bilateral relationship is stronger. The two sides will jointly build the “Belt and Road”, step up national strategic integration, drive innovation and cooperation, and strengthen international cooperation and security cooperation. The scope of Sino-Ukrainian cooperation is getting wider and wider, the quality of cooperation is getting higher and higher, and bilateral relations have entered a golden period of rapid development. At present, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is the highlight and main line of China-Ukraine cooperation. In terms of policy communication, China and Uzbekistan have signed a cooperation document on the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, and are studying the preparation of an outline for China-Ukraine cooperation planning. China appreciates that Uzbekistan has taken the lead in becoming a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. In 2015, the bilateral trade volume between China and Uzbekistan was US$3.5 billion, which was more than 70 times the initial period of diplomatic relations. China has been Uzbekistan’s largest source of investment and second largest trading partner for three consecutive years. All four pipelines of China-Central Asia Natural Gas Pipeline transit Uzbekistan. The two sides completed the ""Angelen-Pap"" railway tunnel, the longest tunnel in Central Asia, in February this year, becoming a new hub connecting China and Central Asia. Both sides support the construction of the China-Ukraine Railway and are willing to work together with relevant countries to promote negotiations. The two parties jointly implemented the tire plant, polyvinyl chloride plant, alkali plant project, and carried out cotton processing cooperation. The ceramic tile, smartphone, leather, and shoe making projects in Zhongwu Industrial Park have begun to take shape. It can be said that the cooperation between the two sides in building the “Belt and Road” has achieved important early gains. Both China and Ukraine have a long history and splendid culture. Humanistic exchanges have always been an important part of Sino-Ukrainian relations. In recent years, the two sides have made new progress in cooperation in the exchange of foreign students, Chinese language teaching, local exchanges, joint archaeology, and mutual translation studies. Humanistic cooperation has become a bond that unites the emotions of the two peoples. The Tashkent Confucius Institute, which is jointly operated by both sides, is the first Confucius Institute in Central Asia. It has trained more than 3,000 Chinese-Ukrainian envoys in the past 11 years. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Northwestern University and other units have actively carried out joint archaeological and historical site restoration work with Uzbekistan, and have made important efforts to restore the historical features of the Silk Road. Not long ago, Uzbekistan Sinologists translated the famous cat writer Lao She's ""City of the Cat"" into Uzbek and published it. I believe it willkeep it up. Not long ago, Uzbekistan sinologists translated the famous cat writer Lao She's ""City of the Cat"" into Uzbek language and published it. It is believed that it will open a window for Uzbekistan people to understand Chinese literature. China and Uzbekistan are a community of interests and a community of destiny based on equality and mutual benefit, security and common prosperity, and win-win cooperation. At present, the realization of national development and national rejuvenation is the dream of the people of China and Ukraine. In the context of the profound evolution of the current international landscape, the slowdown in the world economic recovery, and countries still facing important development tasks, China and Uzbekistan's comprehensive cooperation is in line with the historical trend and is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples. We hope that the road of common development and prosperity between China and Ukraine will become wider and smoother. -We must enhance mutual political trust and increase mutual support. Confucius, an ancient Chinese thinker, said: ""Make friends with one another and speak with confidence."" Mutual political trust is an important guarantee for the healthy development of Sino-Ukrainian relations. The two sides will continue to support each other firmly on issues related to each other's core sovereignty, security, and development. China firmly supports Uzbekistan's choice of development path based on its own national conditions, understands and respects the measures taken by the Uzbek government to maintain domestic stability and promote economic and social development, and opposes interference by external forces in Uzbekistan's internal affairs. ——We must do a good job of building the “Belt and Road” and open up a broader space for cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results. While strengthening cooperation in energy and resources, expand cooperation in non-resource fields and strive to build a new Sino-Ukrainian economic and trade structure with optimized structure and convenient conditions. Look for points of interest, deepen cooperation in production capacity according to local conditions, and transform complementary economic advantages into more tangible results of cooperation. ——We must carefully build the project of people-to-people communication between China and Uzbekistan, and enhance the pride and self-confidence of China and Uzbekistan as ancient Silk Road countries through deepening cultural, educational, tourism, archaeological and local cooperation. Give play to the link between the two Confucius Institutes, strengthen the exchange of young students, and train more successors in China-Ukraine friendship. Support China's ""Happy Chinese New Year"" and Uzbekistan's ""Oriental Rhythm"" visits and activities, and encourage brand programs and excellent literary and artistic works to penetrate the folk. -We must practice the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept and deepen China-Ukraine law enforcement and security cooperation. Strengthen situation research and information exchange, severely crack down on ""three forces"" and drug trafficking and other transnational organized crimes, jointly create a safe environment for regional peaceful development, and safeguard the lives and property of the people of the two countries. -We must strengthen strategic cooperation in international affairs and deepen coordination and cooperation on the multilateral arena such as the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Resolutely support the constructive international initiatives put forward by the other party, and exchange views on global issues such as global economic governance, energy security, water resources, and regional and hot issues in Afghanistan, West Asia, North Africa, etc., and jointly safeguard the strategic interests of the two countries. China supports Uzbekistan in playing a greater role in international affairs. , Another important agenda for me this time in Uzbekistan is attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tashkent Summit. This year is the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. This summit will be of great significance for summarizing the development experience of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and planning for future cooperation. Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has promoted the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and seeking common development. It has actively advocated a new type of international relationship that is open, inclusive, and win-win cooperation, making important contributions to promoting regional stability and prosperity. . The Shanghai Cooperation Organization signed and implemented documents such as the Shanghai Convention against the ""Three Forces"" and member states’ border defense cooperation agreements, and regularly held joint counter-terrorism exercises, which effectively contained the activities of transnational crime and terrorist extremist organizations in the region and effectively resisted the common challenges faced by member states. Security Risk. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has continuously deepened pragmatic cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, transportation, energy, infrastructure construction, agriculture, and humanities, which has promoted the economic and social development of member countries and deeply rooted the concept of good-neighborly friendship and mutual benefit. As the expansion process started, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's circle of friends continued to expand, covering areas in Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and Southeast Asia. The potential for organizational cooperation has greatly increased, and its international status and influence have continued to increase. Uzbekistan, as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, has made positive contributions to promoting cooperation in various fields and achieving practical results. China is willing to work with Uzbekistan and other member states to take the Tashkent summit as a new starting point and comprehensively improve the level of cooperation so that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization can better benefit the people of the region and other countries. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Uzbekistan’s independence. I congratulate this. Under the leadership of President Karimov, Uzbekistan’s national construction has made remarkable achievements, and its international influence has continued to increase. The Uzbekistan government pursues the purpose of developing and serving the people, and benefits the economic growth more to the general public.Long-term achievements will benefit the general public more, and have implemented special national programs such as the ""Year of Youth"", ""Year of Children's Health"", ""Year of Caring for the Elderly"", and ""Year of Maternal and Infant Health"" to form a continuous improvement in people's livelihood and a good balance between urban and rural development. situation. Uzbekistan has successfully explored a Uzbekistan model that fits its national conditions. China wishes Uzbekistan's national construction cause greater achievements. , Uzbekistan proverb says: ""Only the big trees that bear fruit will attract attention."" All-round cooperation between China and Uzbekistan has yielded fruitful results for the benefit of the two peoples, as well as the support and support of the two peoples. I believe that on the journey of realizing the development and rejuvenation of their respective countries, China and Uzbekistan will be able to go hand in hand and write the China-Ukraine friendship Xinhua chapter.

20,139,"[, Dear President Salgado,, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, friends: Good afternoon, everyone! In the early summer of the southern hemisphere, I am very happy to have the opportunity to visit the beautiful and rich ancient civilization, Peru, and meet with my deputies and friends in Congress. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to convey the sincere greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to all of you, and through you, to the friendly Peruvian people! I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and high respect to people from all walks of life who have long been committed to the friendship between China and Peru. , Just now, President Salgado awarded me the ""Cross Medal of the Congress of Peru"", I feel very honored. This is not only a personal honour to me, but also reflects the high importance that the Peruvian side attaches to the relations between the two countries and the deep friendship of the Peruvian people to the Chinese people. I express my heartfelt thanks for this, and will always cherish this friendship and good memories. , In the 1990s, I visited Peru. After more than 20 years, I set foot on this beautiful land again. I have once again experienced the profound historical background and the rapid development and changes of Peru. I really appreciate the vigorous vitality of the relations between the two countries and the profound friendship of the two peoples. , Peru is the ancient civilization of the world and the birthplace of the Inca civilization. The Inca civilization is profound and brilliant, and it is a bright pearl in the history of human civilization. Machu Picchu’s magnificent architecture and Nazca landscape paintings are fascinating, with advanced ceramics, metallurgy, and textile craftsmanship. Literature, music, and dance are popular. Medicine, astronomy, and calendar skills are superb. The Peruvian people have a tradition of resisting external oppression and grasping their own destiny. History will always remember that in the early 19th century, the brave and fearless Peruvian people made great sacrifices and contributions to the national independence movement in Latin America. In recent years, the Peruvian people have made unremitting efforts and made remarkable achievements on the road of independent development. Peru actively maintains peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean and promotes in-depth development of regional integration. As an important emerging market country in the Pacific Rim, Peru pursues an open strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. It has successfully held two APEC leaders’ informal meetings, actively promoted the process of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, and contributed to enhancing the level of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and promoting regional common prosperity. . , Peru is China's ""neighbor"" across the Pacific. As early as more than 400 years ago, the Chinese and Peruvian people crossed the ocean and opened the prelude to exchanges between the two sides. Over the years, the overseas Chinese living in Peru have worked together with the Peruvian people to share the hardships and endeavors of self-improvement and hard work. They have made important contributions to the local economic and social development. The ""China General Services Administration"" established 130 years ago has made positive contributions to the development of China-Peru relations. I learned that at present, Peru has about 2.5 million Chinese of Chinese descent. In Peru, the Spanish word ""hometown"" is used to refer specifically to Chinese descendants, and the word ""meal"" in Chinese Cantonese has evolved into a general term for Chinese restaurants. The friendship between Chinese and Peruvian relatives has long taken root in the hearts of the two peoples. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! This year is the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Peru. Over the past 45 years, the two sides have treated each other sincerely and friendly, treated each other as equals, and cooperated and developed mutually beneficially. In 2013, China and Peru established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields has been further deepened. , ——China and Peru are good brothers who trust each other. The two sides have frequent exchanges at all levels, in-depth dialogue and broad consensus. China highly appreciates that President Kuchynski took China as the first country to visit after taking office. Mr. President and I have exchanged visits in less than 3 months, which shows a high level of political mutual trust between the two sides. -China and Peru are good partners for common development. Peru is the first Latin American country to sign a free trade agreement with China. It is at the forefront of Latin American countries in developing cooperation with China. In the six years since the implementation of the free trade agreement, the bilateral trade volume has doubled. There are more than 170 Chinese-funded enterprises in Peru with a total investment of 18 billion US dollars. The investment field is becoming more diverse and the cooperation projects are progressing smoothly. , ——China and Peru are good friends who share responsibilities. This year, China and Peru have held the G20 Leaders’ Summit and the APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting to maintain close coordination and cooperation on major topics such as global economic governance, Asia-Pacific regional cooperation, and implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Safeguarding the interests of developing countries has contributed to the recovery of the world economy. , This morning, I exchanged in-depth views with President Kuchynski on deepening China-Peru comprehensive strategic partnership. Mr. President proposed to achieve the goal of ""just, fair and united Peru"" on the 200th anniversary of Peru's independence in 2021. By then, the Chinese people will fully build a well-off society and realizeOn the occasion of the 200th anniversary of its establishment, the goal of ""justice, fairness, and united Peru"" will be achieved. By then, the Chinese people will build a well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first goal of the ""two hundred years"" struggle goals we have determined. We will walk side by side and work together to realize our dreams. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , This is the third time I have stepped on this vast land of Latin America and the Caribbean as the President of China. The friendly exchanges between China and Latin America have a long history. Our ancestors have formed a profound friendship passed down from generation to generation. In the new century, China-Latin America relations have achieved leapfrog development and cooperation in various fields has been comprehensively promoted. In 2014, I held the first collective meeting with leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries to establish a comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Latin America on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and common development. The development of China-Latin America relations has entered a new historical stage and a new development pattern has been initially formed. , Olaya, the hero of the Peruvian War of Independence, said: ""Even if I have a thousand lives, I am willing to dedicate all to my motherland."" This sentence profoundly reflects China's perception of similar historical encounters. A natural sense of identity and a common sense of mission allow us to view each other’s relationship from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, and understand and support each other on core interests and major concerns that involve territorial sovereignty and development rights. We candidly dialogue, expand consensus, firmly grasp the general direction of China-Latin America relations, and provide political guarantee for the sustained and healthy development of China-Latin America relations. China and Latin America have followed the trend of the developing countries in deepening regional cooperation. They have established the China-Latin America and Caribbean Community Forum to push China-Latin America relations into a new phase of overall cooperation and bilateral cooperation. China has become the second largest trading partner of Latin America. Latin America has become the second largest destination for Chinese overseas investment after Asia. China’s direct investment in Latin America has exceeded 150 billion US dollars. Today, I will also join President Kuchynski at the ""Across the World-China Treasure Exhibition"" to mark the end of the splendid China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year. ""Let's know no distance, and thousands of miles are still neighbors."" China and Latin America's emphasis on mutual trust, mutual assistance, mutual benefit, mutual learning and mutual learning is in line with the trend of the times and the fundamental interests of the people of both sides. It is a model of South-South cooperation in the new era. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! ""There will be times when the long winds and the waves will break through, and the sea of ​​wind and wind will be directly linked."" The vast number of developing countries, including China and Latin American countries, are facing rare opportunities to open up sources of growth, expand cooperation space, and achieve higher levels of development. China and Latin America have stood at a new historical starting point. Let us jointly build the great ship of China-Latin America Destiny Community and lead the friendly relations between China and Latin America into a new voyage. To this end, I would like to make the following suggestions. First, hold high the banner of peaceful development and cooperation, and make the ship of the community of shared destiny between China and Latin America stable and long-term. China and Latin America account for one-fifth of the world's area, and the population accounts for nearly one-third of the world, and are the key forces for maintaining world peace and stability. We must strengthen strategic communication and dialogue on global issues, and strive to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. China will always have long-term friendship and solidarity with Latin American countries, firmly support Latin American countries to explore a development path that suits their national conditions, firmly support Latin America to achieve joint self-improvement, development and revitalization, and firmly support Latin America to play a greater role in international and regional affairs. Secondly, promote the integration of development strategies and let the ship of China-Latin America Community of Destiny sail on the wind. China is willing to strengthen the exchange of governance experience with Latin American countries, strengthen macro-policy planning and coordination, and promote the convergence of Chinese development planning with the development strategies of Latin American and Caribbean countries. We also need to connect the development of China-Latin America relations with international and regional development, actively participate in trade and investment arrangements and innovative development in the Asia-Pacific region, integrate into a broader mutually beneficial cooperation network, and use China-Latin America joint development to help the global economy become strong, sustainable, and balanced. The path to inclusive growth. Thirdly, to accelerate the cooperation of shifting gears and make the ship of China-Latin America community of destiny full of prosperity. In order to adapt to the new situation and overcome the new challenges, China-Latin America pragmatic cooperation must achieve a new leap. This process is like sailing against the current. We must continue to take innovation and development as the first driving force, within the new framework of ""1+3+6"" pragmatic cooperation, give full play to our advantages, coordinate actions, enhance the level and level of pragmatic cooperation between China and Latin America, promote new growth through trade, and promote investment through investment New development, providing new support with financial cooperation, stimulating new impetus with industrial connection, creating new opportunities with overall cooperation, firmly advancing the development of the China-Latin America and Caribbean Community Forum, giving play to the overall promotion of pragmatic cooperation, and strengthening cooperation Cooperation between Latin American and Caribbean subregional organizations. Fourth, to achieve the sharing of cooperation achievements and let the ship of China-Latin America community of destiny benefit the people. We want the people of both sides to become promoters, practitioners and beneficiaries of China-Latin America cooperation. China will strengthen cooperation in technology transfer and human resources in Latin America. In the next three years, on the basis of existingIt is the promoter, practitioner and beneficiary of China-Latin America cooperation. China will strengthen cooperation in technology transfer and human resources in Latin America. In the next three years, the number of training places for Latin America will be increased to 10,000 on the existing basis. China will set up a China-Latin America News Exchange Center in China and invite Latin American media reporters to work and study in China. China proposes to hold the China-Latin America Environment and Development Policy Round Table Dialogue in Beijing next year, and welcomes Latin America to actively participate in the meeting. Chinese enterprises should respect the cultural customs of local people, abide by local laws, and shoulder their due social responsibilities in the localization of investment, promotion of local employment and the development of social undertakings. We also need to carry out cultural and cultural exchanges and mutual learning of civilizations, so that China-Latin America cooperation can develop synchronously at the material and spiritual levels. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, the international situation is complex and changeable, and geopolitical factors are intertwined. Regional conflicts and global challenges such as security conflicts and turbulence, refugee crises, climate change, and terrorism cannot be ignored. The world economy is undergoing a tortuous recovery through in-depth adjustment. It is in a critical period of conversion of old and new growth momentum. International trade and investment are sluggish, protectionism is on the rise, and the development of emerging market economies is facing more challenges. At the same time, the international order continues to evolve in a direction that is conducive to peace and development. A new round of scientific and technological and industrial revolutions has spawned and fundamental changes in people's production and lifestyles are brewing. The world pattern is in a historic process of accelerating evolution. The rise of emerging market countries and developing countries has become an irresistible historical trend. ""A trip on the avenue is also a matter of world justice."" In today's world, countries are interdependent and share common ground. We must follow the trend and promote the construction of a new type of international relationship with win-win cooperation as the core and create a community of human destiny. , Chinese people have always been ""sincerity and morality."" ""The benevolent is a world with everything."" China has always advocated that all countries in the world work together to establish a partnership of equality, mutual understanding, mutual understanding, fairness and justice, and a shared and shared security structure, open and innovative, inclusive and mutually beneficial development prospects. Harmonious and eclectic civilization exchanges respect the natural and green development of the ecosystem. We must uphold that all countries in the world are equal, and we must not overwhelm the small, bully the weak, and bully the rich. The right of each country to choose its own social system and development path should be safeguarded. It is necessary to abandon all forms of Cold War thinking, establish a new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security, co-ordinate the response to traditional and non-traditional security threats, and prevent the scourge of war. The situation where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is not only unsustainable, but also contrary to fairness and justice. We must uphold the spirit of openness and promote mutual help and mutual benefit. Different civilizations condense the wisdom and contributions of different peoples, there is no difference between high and low, and there is no distinction between advantages and disadvantages. We must respect all civilizations, treat each other as equals, learn from each other, learn from each other, and learn from each other, so as to promote the creative development of human civilization. The international community should collaborate on the road of global ecological civilization construction, firmly establish the consciousness of respecting nature, adapting to nature and protecting nature, and stick to the road of green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. More than 1.3 billion Chinese people are struggling to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China will always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a maintainer of the international order. It will firmly follow the path of peaceful development. No matter how the international situation changes or how it develops, China will never seek hegemony, never expand, never Seek sphere of influence. China will stick to the path of common development, continue to pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, actively implement the correct concept of justice and benefit, share its own development experience and opportunities with all countries in the world, and welcome all countries to take China’s development “windmill” to achieve common development together . China will continue to stand with the vast number of developing countries and firmly support the increasing representation and voice of developing countries in the international governance system. At present, China is focusing on implementing supply-side structural reforms and accelerating the transformation of the economic development mode, guided by the development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing. China's economic development is generally stable. The growth rate of China's economy in the first three quarters of this year was 6.7%. The market with a population of more than 1.3 billion has immeasurable potential. China’s economic restructuring and industrial optimization and upgrading will generate huge demand. , China's development is an opportunity for the world. It is estimated that in the next five years, China's total imports will reach 8 trillion US dollars, the total amount of foreign investment utilized will reach 600 billion US dollars, the total foreign investment will reach 750 billion US dollars, and outbound tourism will reach 700 million passengers. This will provide countries in the world including Latin America with a broader market, more sufficient capital, richer products, and more valuable opportunities for cooperation. China's economic development prospects are bright and will contribute to global economic growth. At the beginning of September, the G20 Hangzhou Summit was successfully held and achieved a series of important achievements in innovative growth methods, improving global economic and financial governance, promoting international trade and investment, and promoting inclusive and joint development.Held and achieved a series of important results in innovating growth methods, improving global economic and financial governance, promoting international trade and investment, and promoting inclusive and joint development. As the chairman of the G20 this year, China attaches great importance to listening to the opinions and concerns of developing countries, inviting the most developing countries in history to attend the summit, and pushing the G20 to place development issues at the core of the global macro-policy coordination framework. The G20 Hangzhou Summit adopted documents such as the Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is believed to play a positive role in promoting international development cooperation. China is willing to continue to maintain communication and coordination with all parties to jointly promote a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China has an old saying: ""Life is a pleasure in knowing each other."" The people of China and Peru have always been emotionally connected and connected. Here, I would like to mention two Peruvian friends. One is the late Peruvian writer and journalist Antonio Arce. Since the 1960s, he has traveled to China many times to cover reports in order to show the real China to the Latin American people. In 1970, his daughter Mei Mei was born in Beijing, but unfortunately suffered from septicemia. When Premier Zhou Enlai knew about the situation, he immediately instructed medical experts to treat her. The Chinese People's Liberation Army quickly organized the soldiers to rush to the hospital to donate blood, and Mei Mei eventually turned to safety. After growing up, like his father, Mei Mei has long contributed to China-Peru friendship. , The other is Mr. Ji Yemo, a Peruvian Sinologist and translator. He taught Spanish at Nanjing University and University of International Business and Economics from 1979 to 1991 and wrote ""Reports from China"", ""Li Bai Poem Selection"", "" Encyclopedia of Chinese Culture and other works. In addition, he is still a movie star in China, starring in 25 Chinese movies including ""The Great Decisive Battle"" and ""Chongqing Negotiations"", which is loved by Chinese audiences. Now, Mr. Ji Yemo is 87 years old. I heard that he still insists on visiting China every year, and I pay him high respects. There are still many such beautiful fragments and touching stories. They are all vivid portraits of the profound friendship of the Chinese and Peruvian people, and will always be engraved in the annals of friendly exchanges between the two countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Peruvian writer Rivero said: ""True happiness lies in always maintaining the enthusiasm for pioneering."" Let us grasp the pulse of the times, seize the development opportunities, cooperate sincerely on the road to realize the Chinese dream and the Latin American dream, and promote the comprehensive partnership between China and Latin America The relationship has achieved a higher level of development, creating a community of shared destiny between China and Latin America. , Gracias! Thank you! , (Xinhua News Agency, Lima, November 21st), ""People's Daily"" (November 23, 2016, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the Peruvian Congress (full text),5318,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-11-23,"[, 尊敬的萨尔加多主席，, 各位议员朋友，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家下午好！在南半球的初夏时节，有机会访问美丽富饶的文明古国秘鲁，并在国会同各位议员朋友见面，我感到十分高兴。, 首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人名义，向在座各位，并通过你们，向友好的秘鲁人民，转达中国人民的诚挚问候和良好祝愿！向长期致力于中秘、中拉友好的各界人士，表示衷心感谢和崇高敬意！, 刚才，萨尔加多主席授予我“秘鲁国会大十字勋章”，我感到不胜荣幸。这不仅是给予我个人的荣誉，更体现了秘方对两国关系的高度重视，体现了秘鲁人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。我对此表示衷心感谢，并将永远珍藏这份情谊和美好记忆。, 上世纪90年代，我访问过秘鲁。时隔20余年再次踏上这片美丽的土地，我又一次领略到秘鲁深厚的历史底蕴和日新月异的发展变化，由衷体会到两国关系的旺盛活力和两国人民的深厚情谊。, 秘鲁是世界文明古国、印加文明发源地。印加文明博大精深、灿烂夺目，是人类文明史上一颗璀璨的明珠。马丘比丘宏伟建筑、纳斯卡地画令人神往，制陶、冶金、纺织工艺先进，文学、音乐、舞蹈脍炙人口，医药、天文、历法技艺精湛，至今依然闪烁着人类智慧的光芒。, 秘鲁人民素有反抗外来压迫、把握自身命运的传统。历史将永远铭记，19世纪初，英勇无畏的秘鲁人民为拉丁美洲民族独立运动作出了巨大牺牲和贡献。, 近年来，秘鲁人民不懈努力，在独立自主的发展道路上取得了显著成就。秘鲁积极维护拉美和加勒比地区和平稳定，推动地区一体化深入发展。作为环太平洋重要新兴市场国家，秘鲁奉行面向亚太的开放战略，两次成功举办亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议，积极推进亚太自由贸易区进程，为提升亚太经济合作水平、促进区域共同繁荣作出了贡献。, 秘鲁是中国在太平洋对岸的“邻居”。早在400多年前，中秘人民就跨越大洋，拉开了双方交往的序幕。多年来，旅居秘鲁的华侨华人同秘鲁人民一道，同甘共苦，自强不息，艰苦创业，为当地经济社会发展作出了重要贡献。130年前成立的“中华通惠总局”，为促进中秘关系发展作出了积极贡献。我了解到，目前，秘鲁拥有中国血统的华裔约250万人。在秘鲁，西班牙语“老乡”一词用来专指中国后裔，中国广东话“吃饭”一词演变为中餐厅的统称。中秘亲如一家的友好情谊早已在两国人民心中生根发芽。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 今年是中秘建交45周年。45年来，双方真诚友好、平等相待，互利合作、共同发展。2013年中秘建立全面战略伙伴关系，两国各领域合作进一步深化。, ——中秘是相互信任的好兄弟。双方各层级交往频繁，对话深入，共识广泛。中方高度赞赏库琴斯基总统上任后将中国作为首个出访国家。我同总统先生在不到3个月的时间实现互访，显示了双方高水平的政治互信。, ——中秘是共同发展的好伙伴。秘鲁是第一个同中国签署一揽子自由贸易协定的拉美国家，在开展对华合作方面走在拉美国家前列。自由贸易协定实施6年来，双边贸易额翻番，在秘鲁中资企业达170多家，各类投资总额达到180亿美元，投资领域日益多元，合作项目进展顺利。, ——中秘是共担责任的好朋友。今年中国和秘鲁先后举办了二十国集团领导人峰会和亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议，就全球经济治理、亚太区域合作、落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程等重大议题保持密切协调和合作，共同维护发展中国家利益，为世界经济复苏作出了贡献。, 今天上午，我同库琴斯基总统就深化中秘全面战略伙伴关系深入交换意见。总统先生提出，要在2021年秘鲁独立200周年之际，实现“公正、公平、团结的秘鲁”这一奋斗目标。届时，中国人民将全面建成小康社会，实现我们确定的“两个一百年”奋斗目标中的第一个目标。我们将并肩同行、携手圆梦。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 这次是我第三次以中国国家主席身份踏上拉丁美洲和加勒比这片广袤的土地。中拉友好交往源远流长。我们的先辈们结下了世代传承的深厚情谊。进入新世纪，中拉关系实现跨越式发展，各领域合作全面推进。2014年，我同拉美和加勒比国家领导人举行了首次集体会晤，确立了平等互利、共同发展的中拉全面合作伙伴关系，中拉关系发展进入新的历史阶段，新的发展格局已经初步形成。, 秘鲁独立战争英雄奥拉亚说：“纵使我有一千次生命我也愿意全部献给我的祖国。”这句话，深刻反映了中拉对相似历史遭遇的感知。天然的认同感和共同的使命感，让我们能够从战略高度和长远角度看待彼此关系，在涉及领土主权、发展权益等核心利益和重大关切问题上相互理解和支持。我们坦诚对话、扩大共识，牢牢把握中拉关系大方向，为中拉关系持续健康发展提供了政治保障。, 中拉双方顺应发展中国家深化区域整体合作的时代潮流，建立了中国—拉丁美洲和加勒比国家共同体论坛，推动中拉关系进入整体合作和双边合作并行互促新阶段。中国已经成为拉美第二大贸易伙伴国，拉美成为仅次于亚洲的中国海外投资第二大目的地，中国对拉美直接投资已经超过1500亿美元。今天，我还将同库琴斯基总统一道出席“天涯若比邻—华夏瑰宝展”，为异彩纷呈的中拉文化交流年活动画上圆满句号。, “相知无远近，万里尚为邻。”中拉重在互信互助、互利互惠、互学互鉴，符合时代潮流，也符合双方人民根本利益，是新时期南南合作的典范。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。”包括中国和拉美国家在内的广大发展中国家面临着开辟增长源泉、拓展合作空间、实现更高水平发展的难得机遇。中拉已经站在新的历史起点上，让我们共同打造好中拉命运共同体这艘大船，引领中拉友好关系驶入新的航程。为此，我愿提出以下几点建议。, 第一，高举和平发展合作旗帜，让中拉命运共同体之船行稳致远。中国和拉美面积占世界五分之一，人口占世界近三分之一，是维护世界和平稳定的关键力量。我们要加强在全球性问题上的战略沟通和对话，努力提升新兴市场国家和发展中国家的代表性和发言权。中国将始终同拉美国家长期友好、同舟共济，坚定支持拉美国家探索符合国情的发展道路，坚定支持拉美实现联合自强、发展振兴，坚定支持拉美在国际和地区事务中发挥更大作用。, 第二，推动发展战略对接，让中拉命运共同体之船乘风远航。中国愿同拉美国家加强治国理政经验交流，增强宏观政策规划和协调，推动中国发展规划同拉美和加勒比国家发展战略衔接。我们还要将中拉关系发展同国际和区域发展对接，积极参与亚太地区贸易投资安排和创新发展，融入更加广阔的互利合作网络，以中拉共同发展助力全球经济走上强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长之路。, 第三，推进合作换挡加速，让中拉命运共同体之船满载繁荣。为适应新形势、战胜新挑战，中拉务实合作必须实现新飞跃，这一过程如同逆水行舟、不进则退。我们要继续以创新发展为第一动力，在“1+3+6”务实合作新框架内，发挥优势，协同行动，提升中拉务实合作的层次和水平，以贸易拉动新增长，以投资促进新发展，以金融合作提供新支撑，以产业对接催生新动力，以整体合作创造新机遇，坚定推进中国—拉丁美洲和加勒比国家共同体论坛发展，发挥整体合作对务实合作的促进作用，同时加强同拉美和加勒比次区域组织合作。, 第四，实现合作成果共享，让中拉命运共同体之船造福人民。我们要让双方人民成为中拉合作的推动者、实践者、受益者。中方将加强对拉美技术转让和人力资源合作，未来3年，在现有基础上将各类对拉美培训名额增加至1万人。中方将在华设立中拉新闻交流中心，邀请拉美媒体记者赴华工作学习。中方倡议明年在北京举办中拉环境与发展政策圆桌对话会，欢迎拉方积极参会。中国企业要尊重当地人民的文化习俗，遵守当地法律，在投资本地化、促进当地就业和社会事业发展方面担负起应有的社会责任。我们还要开展人文交流和文明互鉴，让中拉合作在物质和精神层面同步发展。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，国际形势复杂多变，地缘政治因素错综交织，安全冲突和动荡、难民危机、气候变化、恐怖主义等地区热点和全球性挑战不容忽视。世界经济在深度调整中曲折复苏，正处于新旧增长动能转换的关键时期，国际贸易和投资低迷，保护主义抬头，新兴市场经济体发展面临更多挑战。同时，国际秩序继续向着有利于和平与发展的方向演变，新一轮科技和产业革命孕育兴起，人们生产生活方式酝酿根本性变化。, 世界格局正处在一个加快演变的历史性进程之中，新兴市场国家和发展中国家崛起已经成为不可阻挡的历史潮流。“大道之行也，天下为公。”当今世界，各国相互依存、休戚与共，我们要顺势而为，推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造人类命运共同体。, 中国人历来“以至诚为道，以至仁为德”。“仁者，以天地万物为一体。”中国一贯主张，世界各国共同努力，建立平等相待、互商互谅的伙伴关系，公道正义、共建共享的安全格局，开放创新、包容互惠的发展前景，和而不同、兼收并蓄的文明交流，尊崇自然、绿色发展的生态体系。要坚持世界各国一律平等，不能以大压小、以强凌弱、以富欺贫，各国自主选择社会制度和发展道路的权利应当得到维护。要摒弃一切形式的冷战思维，树立共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的新观念，统筹应对传统和非传统安全威胁，防战争祸患于未然。富者愈富、穷者愈穷的局面不仅难以持续，也有违公平正义。要秉承开放精神，推进互帮互助、互惠互利。不同文明凝聚着不同民族的智慧和贡献，没有高低之别，更无优劣之分。要尊重各种文明，平等相待，互学互鉴，兼收并蓄，推动人类文明实现创造性发展。国际社会应该共谋全球生态文明建设之路，牢固树立尊重自然、顺应自然、保护自然的意识，坚持走绿色、低碳、循环、可持续发展之路。, 13亿多中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。中国将始终做世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者，坚定走和平发展道路，无论国际形势如何变化，无论自身如何发展，中国永不称霸、永不扩张、永不谋求势力范围。中国将坚持走共同发展道路，继续奉行互利共赢的开放战略，积极践行正确义利观，将自身发展经验和机遇同世界各国分享，欢迎各国搭乘中国发展“顺风车”，一起实现共同发展。中国将继续同广大发展中国家站在一起，坚定支持增加发展中国家在国际治理体系中的代表性和发言权。, 当前，中国正以创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念为指引，着力实施供给侧结构性改革，加快转变经济发展方式。中国经济发展总体平稳，今年前三季度中国经济增速为6.7%。13亿多人口的市场具有不可估量的潜力，中国经济结构调整和产业优化升级将产生巨大需求。, 中国发展是世界的机遇。预计未来5年，中国进口总额将达到8万亿美元，利用外资总额将达到6000亿美元，对外投资总额将达到7500亿美元，出境旅游将达到7亿人次。这将为包括拉美国家在内世界各国提供更广阔的市场、更充足的资本、更丰富的产品、更宝贵的合作契机。中国经济发展前景是光明的，将为全球经济增长作出贡献。, 9月初，二十国集团领导人杭州峰会成功举行，在创新增长方式、完善全球经济金融治理、促进国际贸易和投资、推动包容联动发展方面取得一系列重要成果。作为今年二十国集团主席国，中方高度重视听取发展中国家意见和关切，邀请历史上最多的发展中国家出席峰会，推动二十国集团把发展问题放在全球宏观政策协调框架核心位置。二十国集团领导人杭州峰会通过了《落实2030年可持续发展议程行动计划》等文件，相信将为促进国际发展合作发挥积极作用。中方愿继续同各方保持沟通和协调，共同推动世界经济强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国有句古话：“人生乐在相知心。”中秘两国人民历来感情相连、心灵相通。这里，我想提及两位秘鲁朋友。一位是已故秘鲁作家、记者安东尼奥·阿尔塞，上世纪60年代起，为了向拉美民众展示真实的中国，他多次远赴中国采访报道。1970年，他的女儿梅梅在北京出生，但不幸罹患败血病。周恩来总理知道这一情况后，立即指示医学专家对她进行救治，中国人民解放军迅速组织战士赶往医院献血，梅梅最终转危为安。长大后，同父亲一样，梅梅长期为中秘友好事业贡献自己的力量。, 另一位是秘鲁汉学家和翻译家吉叶墨先生，他1979年至1991年在中国南京大学和对外经贸大学教授西班牙语，撰写了《来自中国的报道》、《李白诗选》、《中国文化百科全书》等著作。此外，他在中国还是一位影星，出演了包括《大决战》、《重庆谈判》等25部中国电影，受到中国观众喜爱。现在，吉叶墨先生已经87岁了，听说他仍然坚持每年访华，我向他致以崇高的敬意。, 这样的美好片段和感人故事还有很多，它们都是中秘人民深情厚谊的生动写照，将永远镌刻在两国友好交往的史册上。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 秘鲁作家里韦罗说：“真正的幸福在于始终保持开拓的热情。”让我们把握时代脉搏、抓住发展机遇，在实现中国梦和拉美梦的道路上精诚合作，推动中拉全面合作伙伴关系实现更高水平发展，铸就携手共进的中拉命运共同体。, 格拉希亚斯！谢谢！, （新华社利马11月21日电） , 《

21,140,"[, Dear President Karimov, Dear Chairman Yurdashev, Dear President Ismoilov, Dear friends and parliamentarians, Ministers, Ladies and gentlemen: Good afternoon! I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to the Legislative Yuan of the Supreme Council of Uzbekistan to meet and exchange with friends in the midsummer season. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to convey to you, and through you, the friendly Uzbekistan people the sincere greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people, and long-term commitment to China-Ukraine friendly cooperation The Uzbekistan Supreme Conference of the cause and friends and parliamentarians sincerely express their heartfelt thanks and high respect! , 3 years ago, I visited Tashkent for the first time and visited the historic city of Samarkand, accompanied by President Karimov. Since then, Uzbekistan’s splendid culture, beautiful scenery, and hard-working and brave people have been lingering in my mind. The famous poet Navoi in your country has a famous saying: ""There is nothing better than living in friendship."" Once again set foot on the beautiful land of your country, and once again personally feel the sincere kindness and hospitality of the people of Uzbekistan, I feel very much kind. , Yesterday, I visited the historical and cultural city of Bukhara, which has the reputation of ""Central Asian City Museum"" and ""Living Fossil on the Silk Road"". The magnificent Jacques Castle, the majestic Kayan Xuanli Tower, and the solemn Mausoleum of Saman gave me a glimpse of the great wisdom and skills of the ancient architects, and I felt the splendid history and culture of the Silk Road. The ancient cities of Tashkent, Bukhara and Samarkand, like the pearls scattered on the Silk Road, connect the historical memories of friendly exchanges between East and West, and learn from each other, and also leave a colorful chapter in the history of world civilization . , The land where Uzbekistan is located has a profound cultural heritage and has spawned many masters and masters who have influenced the world. Buhari's ""Hundred Hadiths"" is well-known throughout the ages. Hua Lazimi's ""Algebra"" is a monument to human wisdom. Ibn Sina's ""Medical Code"" is the masterpiece of world medicine, and his philosophical work ""Therapeutics"" is regarded as the highest model of medieval philosophy. The Uluber Observatory and astronomical watch once led the development of world astronomy. The magnificent poems of Navoi opened a new era of Uzbek national culture. The precious heritage of these historical celebrities is still shining with the truth. , ""Looking at the present and admiring the past, it is possible to look at the past, but history is the present."" History is a mirror that illuminates reality and the future. Only by understanding history and respecting history can we better grasp the present, and take history as a mirror and advance with the times in order to better move towards the future. , 25 years ago, Uzbekistan declared independence, and history turned a new page. Over the past 25 years, under the leadership of President Karimov, the people of Uzbekistan have actively explored and made unremitting efforts to embark on a development path that suits their national conditions, and the country has undergone tremendous changes. Uzbekistan, with its ancient civilization, is full of vitality, and the industrious and intelligent people of Uzbekistan are using both hands to depict a magnificent picture of national development and national revitalization. I sincerely wish Uzbekistan's national construction cause greater results! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , During my visit to Central Asia in 2013, I put forward an initiative to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt, which received wide support and positive response from the international community including Uzbekistan. Since then, I have put forward an initiative to build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Silk Road is a great asset left by history. The “Belt and Road” initiative is a precious inspiration left by the ancient Silk Road, focusing on the common dream of people of all countries in pursuit of peace and development, and providing the world with a common prosperity and development plan full of oriental wisdom. In the past three years, the construction of the “Belt and Road” has been advancing in exploration, improving in development, and growing in cooperation. We take consultation, co-construction and sharing as the principles of the “Belt and Road” construction, guided by the Silk Road spirit of peaceful cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, and mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, and create a community of fortune and a community of interests for cooperation The goal has been widely recognized by the countries along the route. Up to now, a total of more than 70 countries and international organizations have actively participated in the construction of the “Belt and Road”. China has formulated a vision and action documents to promote the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, and has signed a joint construction of the “Belt and Road” with more than 30 countries. Cooperation agreement. Our circle of friends is getting wider and wider, and the construction of the “Belt and Road” has gradually become the common dream of people along the route. , During my last visit, President Karimov said to me that there is a proverb in Uzbekistan that ""empty pockets cannot stand up"". Over the past three years, countries along the route have focused on policiesWhen I visited last time, President Karimov said to me that there is a proverb in Uzbekistan that ""empty pockets cannot stand up"". Over the past three years, the countries along the route have focused on policy communication, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, capital and financial links, and people's hearts. They have continuously deepened cooperation and have achieved positive results in many areas. China has signed production capacity cooperation agreements with 20 countries, and jointly built 46 overseas cooperation zones with 17 countries along the “Belt and Road”. Chinese companies have invested more than US$14 billion in total, creating 60,000 local jobs. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is officially in operation, with 57 countries actively participating in it; the Silk Road Fund, the China-Eurasia Economic Cooperation Fund, and others have been successfully established. China sponsors 10,000 freshmen from countries along the route to study or study in China every year. In 2015, China’s bilateral trade with countries participating in the “Belt and Road” exceeded US$1 trillion, accounting for 25% of China’s total foreign trade. Chinese companies’ direct investment in 49 countries along the “Belt and Road” route reached nearly US$15 billion, a year-on-year increase 18%; ""One Belt One Road"" participating countries' investment in China exceeded US$8.2 billion, a year-on-year increase of 25% The construction and planning of the “Belt and Road” have been initially completed, and they are moving towards the stage of rooting, intensive cultivation and sustainable development. Taken together, the countries along the “Belt and Road” have obvious advantages in terms of market size and resource endowment, strong complementarities, huge potential, and broad prospects. ""Knowledge is worse than it was at the time."" China is willing to work with all parties including Uzbekistan to seize historical opportunities, respond to various risk challenges, and promote the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" to a higher level and wider space. First, build a mutually beneficial cooperation network of the “Belt and Road” initiative. China is willing to work with the countries along the “Belt and Road” to conform to the trend of the times, promote the spirit of the Silk Road, enhance mutual trust, consolidate friendship, deepen cooperation, increase mutual support, and build on the principles of voluntariness, equality and mutual benefit. The mutually beneficial cooperation network of the “Belt and Road” that embraces mutual learning, open innovation, and seeks common development, is jointly committed to revitalizing the global economy. , Second, create a new cooperation model of the “Belt and Road” initiative. China is willing to uphold the principles of mutual consultation, co-construction and sharing, based on the integration of the development plans of the countries along the “Belt and Road”, with trade and investment liberalization and facilitation as the link, with interconnection, production capacity cooperation, cultural and cultural exchanges as the pillar, and financial Mutually beneficial cooperation is an important guarantee. Actively carry out bilateral and regional cooperation and strive to create a new ""One Belt, One Road"" cooperation model. China will continue to increase investment to provide all-round support for the construction of the ""Belt and Road"", so that the results of cooperation will benefit all parties. , Third, to build a “Belt and Road” multiple cooperation platform. China is willing to work together with partner countries to promote various forms of mutually beneficial cooperation among governments, enterprises, social institutions, and civil society, enhance the willingness of enterprises to participate independently, absorb social capital to participate in cooperative projects, and jointly create multi-agents, countries, and countries along the “Belt and Road”. All-round, cross-field new platform for mutually beneficial cooperation. , Fourth, promote the key areas of the “Belt and Road” initiative. China is willing to work with partner countries to vigorously promote the construction of the six major international economic cooperation corridors, establish more industrial clusters and economic and trade cooperation zones, and focus on cooperation in key areas. China will work with partner countries to continue to improve the infrastructure network, jointly identify a number of interconnection projects that can enhance the overall level of regional cooperation, study and carry out large-scale customs clearance cooperation; comprehensively promote international production capacity cooperation, and continue to provide high-quality and environmentally friendly production capacity to countries And advanced technical equipment to help relevant partner countries optimize the industrial layout and improve the level of industrialization; strengthen financial innovation and cooperation, expand the scale and scope of local currency settlement with partner countries, promote the development of offshore RMB businesses in countries along the route, innovate financial products; strengthen cooperation in the field of humanities , In-depth cooperation in the fields of education, science and technology, culture, sports, tourism, health, archaeology, etc., establish a big data exchange platform, and jointly create a ""Belt and Road"" think tank cooperation network. Among them, we must focus on deepening environmental protection cooperation, practise the concept of green development, increase ecological and environmental protection, and work together to create the ""green silk road""; focus on deepening medical and health cooperation, strengthen infectious disease epidemic reporting, disease prevention and control, Mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of medical rescue and traditional medicine to create a ""healthy Silk Road""; focusing on deepening cooperation in talent training, China proposes to establish a ""Belt and Road"" vocational and technical cooperation alliance to train and train all kinds of professionals to build the ""Intelligent Silk Road"" Focus on deepening security cooperation, practice a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asian security concept, promote the establishment of a security governance model with Asian characteristics, and work together to create the ""Peaceful Silk Road"". , Central Asia is a must pass through the ancient Silk Road. In the past three years, Central Asian countries have actively participated in the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative, and have taken the lead in obtaining a series of important early gains, which have played a demonstration role. China and Central Asian countries jointly build the “Belt and Road”Actively participated in the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative and took the lead in obtaining a series of important early gains, which played a role in demonstration. The joint construction of the “Belt and Road” between China and Central Asian countries possesses historical and traditional advantages, geo-cultural advantages, political and legal advantages, and has won wide support and approval from the people of all countries. China regards Central Asia as a key cooperative region and an important partner for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. Both sides should strengthen the docking of development strategies and planning, jointly find the entry point for cooperation, and continuously improve the level of cooperation. We are willing to work with Central Asian countries to promote the construction of the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor. , China will host the “Belt and Road” International Summit Forum in 2017. We hope to use this forum as a platform to communicate frankly with partner countries, brainstorm ideas and build consensus, and discuss the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Both China and Uzbekistan are great countries, and the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Ukrainian peoples have a long history. Since the opening of the Silk Road more than 2000 years ago, China's papermaking, iron smelting, and traditional Chinese medicine have spread to the world through Central Asia. The knowledge of astronomy, geography, and mathematics in Central Asia and West Asia have also been introduced to China, which has promoted the development of both sides' society. Chinese Western Han Dynasty Zhang Qian, Tang Dynasty Xuan Zang, Ming Dynasty Chen Cheng, etc. have all been envoys or through Uzbekistan. In the late 13th century, Bahhara's politician Sai Dian Chi Si Si Ding had served as a government official in Pingzhang, Yunnan Province, China. He cultivates water conservancy, runs schools and develops economy, and is loved by the local people. In the mid-14th century, Wu Ru, an astronomical jurist born in Samarkand, was invited to China to participate in the construction of an observatory in Nanjing and served in Chinese astronomical institutions for 50 years. For more than 2000 years, the Silk Road has documented the people of China and Uzbekistan living together in harmony, becoming a historical witness to the friendship between China and Ukraine for generations. The long history of exchanges, profound cultural accumulation, and common goals of struggle are our inexhaustible sources of power to develop bilateral relations and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation. The Chinese and Ukrainian people are industrious and courageous, honest and upholding their commitments, and emphasizing the importance of love and justice. They have a similar understanding of their country. China was one of the first countries to recognize Uzbekistan's independence and establish diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Uzbekistan have adhered to mutual respect and mutual support, promoted traditional friendship, deepened mutually beneficial cooperation, and promoted the continuous development of bilateral relations and achieved fruitful results. In 2012, China and Uzbekistan established a strategic partnership, the development of bilateral relations has entered a fast track, and political mutual trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, and strategic coordination have been comprehensively promoted. Uzbekistan is a big country in Central Asia. China has always viewed China-Uzbekistan relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective. It regards the creation of a community of shared destiny and interests of equality and mutual benefit, security and common prosperity and win-win cooperation as one of diplomatic priorities. Strengthening comprehensive cooperation between China and Ukraine conforms to the historical trend and serves the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples. , This morning, President Karimov and I decided to promote China-Ukraine relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. This is another milestone in the history of the development of relations between the two countries. We must further explore ideas, deepen cooperation potential, innovate cooperation models, enrich cooperation connotations, work together to build a new multi-level, wide-field, and all-round new pattern of mutually beneficial cooperation, and promote China-Ukraine friendly cooperation to write a new chapter in history. During this visit, I jointly agreed with President Karimov that China and Uzbekistan should continue to increase mutual support on issues concerning territoriality, sovereignty, security and other core interests, and firmly support each other’s chosen development path and jointly maintain Political security and political security; comprehensively deepen pragmatic cooperation, promote the common development of the two countries, strengthen the connection of development strategies, tap the potential of economic and trade cooperation, actively promote cooperation in the fields of production capacity, infrastructure, energy, agriculture, etc., and strive to increase financial cooperation on key cooperation projects Support, expand humanities exchanges, improve the level of security cooperation, strengthen coordination of international affairs, and enrich the connotation of China-Ukraine comprehensive strategic partnership with more pragmatic cooperation results. , The Chinese say ""friends have more ways to go"". The parliament is a gathering place for elites from all walks of life. Members of the parliament are friends of the Chinese people. I hope you will continue to be a promoter of Sino-Ukrainian relations, a supporter of Sino-Ukrainian cooperation, and an inheritor of Sino-Ukrainian friendship. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Another important agenda for me this time in Uzbekistan is attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tashkent Summit. This year is the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has promoted the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and seeking common development. It has actively advocated a new type of international relationship that is open, inclusive, and win-win cooperation, making important contributions to promoting regional stability and prosperity. . With the start of the expansion process, there are already 18 members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization family, covering Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and Southeast Asia. The potential for organizational cooperation has been greatly enhanced, and its international status and international influence have continued to increase. , Uzbekistan, as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,The power is greatly enhanced, and the international status and international influence continue to increase. Uzbekistan, as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, has made positive contributions to promoting the achievements of cooperation in various fields. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Karimov, the Uzbekistan government and people! China is willing to work with Uzbekistan and other member states to take the Tashkent summit as a new starting point and comprehensively improve the level of cooperation so that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization can better benefit the people of the region and other countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Uzbekistan's famous poet Navoi has this poem: ""I hope our people live happily and richly."" This is our common goal and eternal pursuit. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of Uzbekistan and the people of other countries to make unremitting efforts to advance the noble cause of human peace and development! , thank you all!

在万物丰茂的盛夏时节，有机会来到乌兹别克斯坦最高会议立法院，同各位朋友见面和交流，我感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位，并通过你们向友好的乌兹别克斯坦人民，转达中国人民的诚挚问候和良好祝愿，向长期致力于中乌友好合作事业的乌兹别克斯坦最高会议和各位议员朋友们，表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意！, 3年前，我首次访问塔什干，并在卡里莫夫总统亲自陪同下参观了历史名城撒马尔罕。从那时起，乌兹别克斯坦灿烂的文化、秀美的风光、勤劳勇敢的人民就一直在我脑海中萦绕。贵国著名诗人纳沃伊有句名言：“没有比生活在友谊之中更美好的事情。”再次踏上贵国美丽的土地，再次亲身感受乌兹别克斯坦人民的真诚善良和热情好客，我感到十分亲切。, 昨天，我访问了历史文化名城布哈拉，这座城市拥有“中亚城市博物馆”和“丝绸之路上的活化石”美誉。气势恢宏的雅克城堡，巍然屹立的卡扬宣礼楼，庄严肃穆的萨曼陵墓，让我领略了古代建筑大师卓越的智慧和技艺，切身感受到丝绸之路的灿烂历史和文化。塔什干、布哈拉、撒马尔罕这些古老城市，就像散布在丝绸之路上的明珠，串接起东西方友好往来、互学互鉴的历史记忆，也在世界文明史上留下了浓墨重彩的篇章。, 乌兹别克斯坦所在的这片土地，具有深厚的文化底蕴，孕育出众多影响世界的大师巨匠。布哈里的《圣训实录》享誉千古。花拉子米的《代数学》堪称人类智慧的一座丰碑。伊本·西拿的《医典》集世界医学之大成，他的哲学著作《治疗论》被奉为中世纪哲学的最高典范。兀鲁伯天文台和天文表曾经引领了世界天文学的发展。纳沃伊的瑰丽诗篇开启了乌兹别克民族文化的崭新时代。这些历史名人的珍贵遗产，至今仍然闪烁着真理的光辉。, “观今宜鉴古，无古不成今。”历史是一面镜子，它照亮现实，也照亮未来。了解历史、尊重历史才能更好把握当下，以史为鉴、与时俱进才能更好走向未来。, 25年前，乌兹别克斯坦宣告独立，历史翻开了新的一页。25年来，在卡里莫夫总统领导下，乌兹别克斯坦人民积极探索，不懈努力，走出了一条符合本国国情的发展道路，国家面貌发生了巨大变化。拥有古老文明的乌兹别克斯坦焕发出勃勃生机，勤劳智慧的乌兹别克斯坦人民正在用双手描绘国家发展和民族振兴的壮丽画卷。我衷心祝愿乌兹别克斯坦国家建设事业取得更大成果！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 2013年我访问中亚期间，提出共同建设丝绸之路经济带的倡议，得到包括乌兹别克斯坦在内国际社会广泛支持和积极响应。此后，我又提出建设21世纪海上丝绸之路的倡议。, 丝绸之路是历史留给我们的伟大财富。“一带一路”倡议是中国根据古丝绸之路留下的宝贵启示，着眼于各国人民追求和平与发展的共同梦想，为世界提供的一项充满东方智慧的共同繁荣发展的方案。, 3年来，“一带一路”建设在探索中前进、在发展中完善、在合作中成长。我们以共商、共建、共享为“一带一路”建设的原则，以和平合作、开放包容、互学互鉴、互利共赢的丝绸之路精神为指引，以打造命运共同体和利益共同体为合作目标，得到沿线国家广泛认同。截至目前，共有70多个国家和国际组织积极参与“一带一路”建设，中方制定出台了推动共建“一带一路”的愿景与行动文件，并同30多个国家签署了共建“一带一路”的合作协议。我们的朋友圈越来越广，“一带一路”建设逐渐成为沿线各国人民共同的梦想。, 我上次来访时，卡里莫夫总统对我说，乌兹别克斯坦有句谚语叫“空口袋立不起来”。3年来，沿线各国聚焦政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通，不断深化合作，已经在多个方面取得积极成果。中国同20个国家签署了产能合作协议，同“一带一路”沿线17个国家共同建设了46个境外合作区，中国企业累计投资超过140亿美元，为当地创造6万个就业岗位。亚洲基础设施投资银行正式运营，57个国家积极参与其中；丝路基金、中国—欧亚经济合作基金等顺利组建。中国每年资助1万名沿线国家新生来华学习或研修。2015年，中国同“一带一路”参与国双边贸易额突破1万亿美元，占中国外贸总额的25%，中国企业对“一带一路”沿线49个国家的直接投资额近150亿美元、同比增长18%；“一带一路”参与国对华投资额超过82亿美元、同比增长25%。“一带一路”建设已经初步完成规划和布局，正在向落地生根、深耕细作、持久发展的阶段迈进。, 综合起来看，“一带一路”沿线国家市场规模和资源禀赋优势明显，互补性强，潜力巨大，前景广阔。“知者善谋，不如当时。”中方愿同包括乌兹别克斯坦在内的各方一道把握历史机遇，应对各种风险挑战，推动“一带一路”建设向更高水平、更广空间迈进。, 第一，构建“一带一路”互利合作网络。中国愿同“一带一路”沿线国家一道，顺应时代潮流，弘扬丝绸之路精神，增进互信，巩固友好，深化合作，加大相互支持，在自愿、平等、互利原则基础上，携手构建务实进取、包容互鉴、开放创新、共谋发展的“一带一路”互利合作网络，共同致力于重振全球经济。, 第二，共创“一带一路”新型合作模式。中国愿秉持共商、共建、共享原则，以“一带一路”沿线各国发展规划对接为基础，以贸易和投资自由化便利化为纽带，以互联互通、产能合作、人文交流为支柱，以金融互利合作为重要保障，积极开展双边和区域合作，努力开创“一带一路”新型合作模式。中国将不断加大投入，为“一带一路”建设提供全方位支持，使合作成果惠及各方。, 第三，打造“一带一路”多元合作平台。中国愿同伙伴国家携手努力，推动各国政府、企业、社会机构、民间团体开展形式多样的互利合作，增强企业自主参与意愿，吸收社会资本参与合作项目，共同打造“一带一路”沿线国家多主体、全方位、跨领域的互利合作新平台。, 第四，推进“一带一路”重点领域项目。中国愿同伙伴国家一道，大力推进六大国际经济合作走廊建设，开办更多产业集聚区和经贸合作区，抓好重点领域合作。中国将同伙伴国家一道，继续完善基础设施网络，共同确定一批能够提升区域整体合作水平的互联互通项目，研究开展大通关合作；全面推进国际产能合作，继续向各国提供优质和环境友好的产能和先进技术装备，帮助有关伙伴国家优化产业布局、提高工业化水平；加强金融创新和合作，扩大同伙伴国家本币结算规模和范围，促进沿线国家离岸人民币业务发展，创新金融产品；加强人文领域合作，深入开展教育、科技、文化、体育、旅游、卫生、考古等领域合作，建立大数据交流平台，共同打造“一带一路”智库合作网络。, 这其中，我们要着力深化环保合作，践行绿色发展理念，加大生态环境保护力度，携手打造“绿色丝绸之路”；着力深化医疗卫生合作，加强在传染病疫情通报、疾病防控、医疗救援、传统医药领域互利合作，携手打造“健康丝绸之路”；着力深化人才培养合作，中方倡议成立“一带一路”职业技术合作联盟，培养培训各类专业人才，携手打造“智力丝绸之路”；着力深化安保合作，践行共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，推动构建具有亚洲特色的安全治理模式，携手打造“和平丝绸之路”。, 中亚是古丝绸之路必经之地。3年来，中亚国家积极参与“一带一路”建设，率先取得一系列重要早期收获，起到了示范作用。中国同中亚国家共建“一带一路”具备历史传统优势、地缘文化优势、政治法律优势，得到各国人民广泛支持和赞同。中国将中亚地区视为共建“一带一路”的重点合作地区和重要合作伙伴。双方要加强发展战略和规划对接，共同寻找合作切入点，不断提高合作水平。我们愿同中亚国家共同推进中国—中亚—西亚经济走廊建设。, 中国将于2017年举办“一带一路”国际高峰论坛。希望以这一论坛为平台，同伙伴国家坦诚交流，集思广益、凝聚共识，共商“一带一路”建设大计。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国和乌兹别克斯坦都是伟大的国家，中乌两国人民友好交往源远流长。2000多年前丝绸之路开通以后，中国的造纸、冶铁、中医等经中亚传播至世界，中亚、西亚的天文、地理、数学等知识也相继传入中国，促进了双方社会发展。中国西汉张骞、唐代玄奘、明代陈诚等都曾出使或途经乌兹别克斯坦。13世纪晚期，祖籍布哈拉的政治家赛典赤·赡思丁曾担任中国云南行省平章政事。他兴修水利、开办学校、发展经济，受到当地人民爱戴。14世纪中期，出生于撒马尔罕的天文历法学家伍儒应邀前往中国，在南京参与修建天文台，并在中国天文机构任职长达50年。 2000多年来，丝绸之路记载了中乌两国人民和睦相处的点点滴滴，成为中乌世代友好的历史见证。, 悠久的交往历史、深厚的文化积淀、共同的奋斗目标，是我们发展两国关系和深化互利合作的不竭动力源泉。中乌两国人民勤劳勇敢、诚实守诺、重情重义，对家国天下有着相似的理解。中国是最早承认乌兹别克斯坦独立并同乌方建立外交关系的国家之一。建交以来，中乌双方坚持相互尊重、相互支持，弘扬传统友谊，深化互利合作，推动两国关系不断发展，取得丰硕成果。2012年中乌建立战略伙伴关系，两国关系发展进入快车道，政治互信、互利合作、战略协调全面推进。, 乌兹别克斯坦是中亚大国，中国始终从战略高度和长远角度看待中乌关系，把打造平等互利、安危与共、合作共赢的中乌命运共同体和利益共同体作为外交优先方向之一。中乌加强全面合作顺应历史潮流，符合两国和两国人民根本利益。, 今天上午，我同卡里莫夫总统决定，把中乌关系提升为全面战略伙伴关系。这是两国关系发展史上又一座里程碑。我们要进一步开拓思路，深挖合作潜力，创新合作模式，丰富合作内涵，携手构建多层级、宽领域、全方位的互利合作新格局，推动中乌友好合作写下新的历史篇章。, 这次访问中，我同卡里莫夫总统共同商定，中乌两国要继续在领土、主权、安全等涉及核心利益的问题上加大相互支持，坚定支持对方选择的发展道路，共同维护政治安全和政权安全；全面深化务实合作，推动两国共同发展，加强发展战略对接，挖掘经贸合作潜力，积极促进产能、基础设施、能源、农业等领域合作，努力加大对重点合作项目的金融支持，扩大人文交往，提高安全合作水平，加强国际事务协调，用更多务实合作成果丰富中乌全面战略伙伴关系内涵。, 中国人说“朋友多了路好走”。议会是各界精英荟萃之地，各位议员是中国人民的朋友，希望大家登高望远，继续做中乌关系的推动者、中乌合作的支持者、中乌友好的传承者。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 我这次在乌兹别克斯坦的另一项重要日程是出席上海合作组织塔什干峰会。今年是上海合作组织成立15周年。15年来，上海合作组织弘扬互信、互利、平等、协商、尊重多样文明、谋求共同发展的“上海精神”，积极倡导开放包容、合作共赢的新型国际关系，为促进地区稳定和繁荣作出重要贡献。随着扩员进程启动，上海合作组织大家庭成员已经有18个国家，地域涵盖中亚、南亚、西亚、东南亚，组织合作潜力大大增强，国际地位和国际影响力持续提升。, 乌兹别克斯坦作为上海合作组织轮值主席国，为推动组织各领域合作取得实际成果作出了积极贡献，我要向卡里莫夫总统、向乌兹别克斯坦政府和人民表示衷心的感谢！中方愿同乌方及其他成员国一道努力，以塔什干峰会为新起点，全面提高合作水平，使上海合作组织更好造福地区和各国人民。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 乌兹别克斯坦著名诗人纳沃伊有这样一句诗：“但愿我们的人民生活得幸福富有。”这是我们共同的目标和永恒的追求。中国人民愿同乌兹别克斯坦人民和各国人民齐心协力，为推进人类和平与发展的崇高事业而不懈努力！, 谢谢大家！拉赫马特！, （新华社塔什干6月22日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年06月23日 02 版）, ]",习近平：携手共创丝绸之路新辉煌,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28470783
22,141,"[, Dear Secretary-General Arabi, Dear Prime Minister Ismail, Dear Ministers, Dear Embassy of Arab Countries, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Nice to meet Arab friends. This is my first visit to an Arab country since I assumed the presidency of China. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to pay high tribute and good wishes to the Arab countries and people! , ""If you are close without seeing it, you can go; if you haven't forgotten for a long time, you can come."" When I came to the Arab countries, my colleagues and I had a sense of closeness. This is because the two ethnic groups in China and Afghanistan treat each other sincerely, exchange friends with each other on the ancient Silk Road, work together in the struggle for national independence, and help each other on the journey of building the country. This trust is unbreakable and cannot be bought with money. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The Middle East is a fertile land. What grieves us is that so far the war and conflict have not escaped. Where is the Middle East going? This is the ""Question of the Middle East"" that the world has repeatedly mentioned. Less conflict and suffering, more peace and dignity, this is the longing of the people of the Middle East. An Arab poet once said: ""When you face the sun, you will definitely see your own hope."" The Middle East contains hope, and all parties must seek hope on the path of dialogue and development. -The key to resolving differences is to strengthen dialogue. Force is not the way to solve problems, zero-sum thinking cannot bring lasting security. Although the dialogue process is long and may even occur repeatedly, the sequelae are minimal and the results are most sustainable. The parties to the conflict should start a dialogue, find the greatest common divisor, and form a focus on advancing the political settlement. The international community should respect the wishes and roles of the parties, neighboring countries, and regional organizations, rather than impose solutions from the outside, and maintain maximum patience and maximum space for dialogue. -The key to solving difficult problems is to accelerate development. The root cause of turmoil in the Middle East is development, and the way out will ultimately depend on development. Development is about people’s lives and dignity. This is a race at the same time, a contest of hope and disappointment. Only by allowing young people to gain dignity in life in their development, in their hearts, hope can outperform disappointment, consciously reject violence, and stay away from extreme thoughts and terrorism. -The key to choosing a road must be in line with national conditions. Modernization is not a multiple choice question. The diversity of historical conditions determines the diversity of development paths chosen by countries. The Arabic proverb says: ""I know where my itch is."" In the exploration of the development path, copying has no way out, imitation is easy to get lost, and practice can only give you real knowledge. The development path of a country can only be determined by the people of that country, based on their own historical heritage, cultural traditions, and the level of economic and social development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Arab League is a symbol of unity among Arab countries. Safeguarding the legitimate national rights and interests of the Palestinian people is the sacred mission of the Arab League and the common responsibility of the international community. The question of Palestine should not be marginalized, nor should it be forgotten by the world. The question of Palestine is the root issue of peace in the Middle East. The international community decides to stop disputes, not only to promote renegotiations, to implement peace treaties, but also to uphold justice and justice, both of which are indispensable. Without justice, peace can only bring icy peace. The international community should insist on fairness and justice, and correct historical injustice as soon as possible. , I would like to call on the international community to take stronger action to activate the peace talks process politically and advance the reconstruction process economically so that the Palestinian people can see hope as soon as possible. China firmly supports the Middle East peace process and the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital and full sovereignty. We understand the legitimate demands of Palestine to integrate into the international community as a national identity, support the establishment of a new peace promotion mechanism for the Middle East, and support the efforts made by the Arab League and the Islamic Cooperation Organization to this end. In order to improve the livelihood of the Palestinian people, China has decided to provide Pakistan with 50 million yuan in free assistance, and will provide support for the construction of Palestinian solar power plants. The current situation in Syria is unsustainable. There will be no winners in the conflict, but the people in the region will suffer. To resolve hotspot issues, a ceasefire is a top priority, political dialogue is the fundamental way, and humanitarian relief cannot be delayed. This year, China will provide another 230 million yuan in humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, and Yemen. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In June 2014, I proposed at the Beijing-China Ministerial Meeting of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum that the Chinese and Arab Communists will build the “Belt and Road”, with energy cooperation as the main axis and infrastructure construction, trade and investment facilitation as the two wings.It was proposed at the long-term meeting that the China-Arab Republic will build the “Belt and Road”, build on energy cooperation as the main axis, take infrastructure construction, trade and investment facilitation as two wings, and take the three high-tech fields of nuclear energy, aerospace satellite and new energy as breakthroughs. Arab friends responded enthusiastically to the ""1+2+3"" cooperation pattern. Now we have an early harvest. , ——The top-level design is maturing. China and Arab countries have established a political and strategic dialogue mechanism, China has established strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries, and signed a ""Belt and Road"" agreement with six Arab countries. Seven Arab countries have become founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. , ——Pragmatic cooperation shows vitality. China is the second largest trading partner of the Arab countries, and the newly signed contract value of the engineering contract with the Arab countries is US$46.4 billion; the Gulf Arab Cooperation Committee restarted negotiations on the China Free Trade Zone and made substantial progress. The Arab countries established two RMB clearing centers China and Arab States established two joint investment funds; the China-Arab Technology Transfer Center was officially inaugurated, and the two parties reached agreement on the establishment of a peaceful use of nuclear energy training center, a clean energy training center, and the landing of the Beidou satellite navigation system; the second China-Arab Expo signed The cooperation project amounted to 183 billion yuan, which has become an important platform for the construction of the “Belt and Road” between China and Arab countries. , ——Humanities and cultural exchanges are rich and colorful. We held the China-Arab Friendship Year event, signed the first agreement to jointly build a joint university, and launched counterpart cooperation with 100 cultural institutions. The number of Arab students studying in China exceeded 14,000, and the number of Confucius Institutes in Arab countries increased to 11. Weekly flights increased to 183 sorties. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China adheres to the path of peaceful development, pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and implements a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy for opening to the outside world. One of its focuses is to actively participate in global governance, build a pattern of mutually beneficial cooperation, undertake international responsibilities, and expand the convergence of interests with other countries. To build a community of human destiny. , We must seize the key period of the next five years to jointly build the “Belt and Road”, establish the concept of action for peace, innovation, leadership, governance and integration, and be the builder of peace in the Middle East, the promoter of Middle East development, and the boost of industrialization in the Middle East , A supporter of stability in the Middle East, and a partner in the Middle East. China is willing to carry out the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative with Arab countries and promote the rejuvenation of the two major ethnic groups in China and Arab countries. First, hold high the banner of peaceful dialogue and carry out actions to promote stability. The construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative advocates that different nationalities and different cultures should “communicate and communicate” instead of “communicate and evil”. They should demolish more walls and build less walls, and use dialogue as a “golden rule”. Be a neighbor who has come and gone. , Mencius, an ancient Chinese sage, said: ""Establish the right position of the world and follow the road of the world."" China's policy measures towards the Middle East insist on starting from the right and wrong of the matter itself and from the fundamental interests of the people of the Middle East. We are not looking for an agent in the Middle East, but persuading peace and promoting talks; not engaging in sphere of influence, but pushing everyone to join the “Belt and Road” circle of friends; we do not seek to fill a “vacuum”, but weave a mutually beneficial and win-win partnership network . The Chinese have a philosophy of poverty and change for a long time, and the Arabs also say ""there is no constant normality"". We respect Arab countries’ demands for change and support Arab countries’ independent exploration of development paths. It is very important to properly handle the relationship between reform, development and stability. This is like the camel race that Arabs like to see. If they run too fast in the first half, they may overdraw in the second half; if they run too slow in the first half, they may not be able to keep up. Only by balancing speed and endurance can a rider stick to the end. The spread of terrorism and extreme thoughts is a severe test of peace and development. Combating terrorism and extreme forces requires a consensus. Terrorism knows no borders and there is no distinction between good and bad. Anti-terrorism cannot have double standards. Similarly, it is not possible to link terrorism to a specific ethnic religion, as that will only create ethnic and religious barriers. No single policy can be fully effective on its own, and counter-terrorism must adhere to comprehensive measures and cure both the symptoms and the symptoms. To this end, China will establish the China-Arab Reform and Development Research Center; hold a roundtable meeting on dialogue and de-extremism within the framework of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum, organize exchange visits of 100 well-known religious figures; strengthen China-Arab network security cooperation and cut off violence Terrorist audio and video network communication channels, and jointly participated in the formulation of international anti-terrorism conventions in cyberspace; provided US$ 300 million in aid for law enforcement cooperation, police training and other projects to help regional countries strengthen capacity building for maintaining stability. , Second, promote structural adjustment and carry out innovative cooperative actions. The increasingly fierce international development competition requires us to improve the level of cooperation. It is necessary to promote a new model of ""oil and gas +"" cooperation and tap new potential for cooperation. The Chinese side is willing to strengthen cooperation with the Arab side on the upstream, middle and lower reaches of the entire industry chain, renew the long-term oil purchase agreement, and build a mutually beneficial and safeNew models to tap new potential for cooperation. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with the whole upstream and downstream industry chain of Algeria, renew the long-term oil purchase agreement, and build a mutually beneficial, safe, reliable, and long-term friendly Sino-Arab energy strategic cooperation relationship. We must innovate trade and investment mechanisms and expand new spaces for cooperation. , China's foreign investment has entered the fast track, and the sovereign funds of Arab countries are strong. We can sign more local currency swap and mutual investment agreements, expand the scale of RMB settlement business, accelerate the investment facilitation process, and guide the participation of both sides' investment funds and social funds."" ""Belt and Road"" key project. Both sides should strengthen cooperation in high-tech fields and foster new impetus for cooperation. They can rely on the established technology transfer and training centers to speed up the implementation of high-tech, nuclear, aerospace, new energy, genetic engineering and other high-tech projects, and increase the gold content of China-Arab practical cooperation. To this end, China will implement innovative cooperation actions, and is willing to explore a package of cooperation models with ""Oil, Loans, and Engineering"", extend the traditional oil and gas cooperation chain, and cooperate in the development of new and renewable energy sources; China will participate in the construction of the Middle East Industrial Park, Focus on promoting the construction of the Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, and realize the integration of processing, manufacturing, transportation, and export through personnel training, joint planning, and cooperative factory construction; launch the China-Arab Science and Technology Partnership Program to jointly build in modern agriculture, information communication, population health and other fields 10 joint laboratories; holding the China-Arab Beidou Cooperation Forum. Thirdly, promote industrialization in the Middle East and carry out capacity matching activities. Capacity cooperation is in line with the general trend of economic diversification in the Middle East countries and can lead the Middle East countries to embark on a new path of economic, people-oriented and green industrialization. The cost-effectiveness of Chinese equipment, coupled with technology transfer, talent training, and strong financing support, can help Middle Eastern countries spend less money to build urgently needed industries such as steel, nonferrous metals, building materials, glass, automobile manufacturing, power plants, etc. to fill the gaps in the industry To foster new comparative advantages. The combination of China’s superior production capacity and the Middle East’s human resources can create more and better job opportunities. , This morning, I attended the unveiling ceremony of the second phase of the China-Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone. This project will introduce more than 100 enterprises such as textile and clothing, petroleum equipment, motorcycles, and solar energy, which can create more than 10,000 jobs for Egypt. In order to promote the process of industrialization in the Middle East, China will work with Arab countries to jointly implement capacity matching actions, including the establishment of a $15 billion special loan for Middle East industrialization for capacity cooperation and infrastructure construction projects carried out with countries in the region, while providing them to Middle East countries. US$10 billion in commercial loans to support capacity cooperation; provide US$10 billion in preferential loans and increase preferential loan concessions; set up a total of US$20 billion in joint investment funds with the UAE and Qatar, mainly investing in traditional energy, infrastructure construction in the Middle East, High-end manufacturing, etc. . Fourth, advocate civilization exchanges and mutual learning, and carry out actions to enhance friendship. Civilization has diversity, just like the diversity of species in nature, together constituting the source of life on our planet. The Middle East is the meeting place of ancient civilizations of mankind, with colorful civilizations and cultural diversity. China will continue to unwaveringly support the Middle East and Arab countries in safeguarding their national cultural traditions and oppose all discrimination and prejudice against specific ethnic religions. The Chinese civilization and the Arab civilization each have their own systems and characteristics, but they all contain common ideas and common pursuits accumulated by human development and progress. They all value the values ​​of peace, loyalty, self-discipline, etc. We should launch a dialogue of civilizations, advocate tolerance and mutual learning, and explore together the resonant points of the way of actively living in the national cultural traditions with the current era. The extension of the “Belt and Road” is a place where people-to-people exchanges gather and flourish. People's hearts and minds need to work hard for a long time. Yesterday, I met with 10 old Arab friends who won the ""China-Arab Friendship Outstanding Contribution Award"". It is precisely because of the hard work of generation after generation of friendly people that the big trees of China-Arab friendship can flourish and become evergreen. , In order to allow talents and ideas to flow on the ""Belt and Road"", we will implement the ""One Million"" project to promote friendship, including the implementation of the ""Silk Book Fragrance"" concept, and carry out the translation of 100 Chinese-Arabic books; strengthen the connection of think tanks, invite 100 experts and scholars exchange visits; provide 1,000 Arab youth leader training places, invite 1500 Arab political party leaders to visit China, cultivate China-Arab friendship young envoys and political leaders; provide 10,000 scholarship places and 10,000 training Quota, the implementation of 10,000 Chinese and Arab artists exchange visits. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The Egyptian proverb says: ""Pyramid is more timeless than time."" In my opinion, the most timeless is the great spirit of the Egyptian people who advocate change and pursue freedom. Today’s Egypt carries the hope of inheriting civilization and shoulders the mission of exploring the path of revival. China firmly supports the efforts of the Egyptian government and people and looks forward to Egypt. Today’s Egypt carries the hope of inheriting civilization and shoulders the mission of exploring the path of revival. China firmly supports the efforts of the Egyptian government and people and looks forward to Egypt becoming the pillar of regional stability and the benchmark for development. On the road to dream recovery of national rejuvenation, you will inevitably experience twists and turns, but as long as the road is right, you are not afraid of being far away. China and the Arab countries should join hands and climb side by side, working hard to deepen China-Arab friendly cooperation! Work together for the noble cause of human peace and development! , Shukla! Thank you! , (Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 21st), ""People's Daily"" (edition on January 22, 2016 03),]",Xi Jinping: jointly create a bright future for China-Arab relations,4659,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2016-01-22,"[, 尊敬的阿拉比秘书长，, 尊敬的伊斯梅尔总理，, 尊敬的各位部长，, 各位阿拉伯国家使节，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴同阿拉伯朋友见面。这是我担任中国国家主席后首次出访阿拉伯国家。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向阿拉伯国家和人民，致以崇高的敬意和良好的祝愿！, “未之见而亲焉，可以往矣；久而不忘焉，可以来矣。”来到阿拉伯国家，我和我的同事们都有一种亲近感。这是因为，在穿越时空的往来中，中阿两个民族彼此真诚相待，在古丝绸之路上出入相友，在争取民族独立的斗争中甘苦与共，在建设国家的征程上守望相助。这份信任牢不可破，是金钱买不到的。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中东是一块富饶的土地。让我们感到痛心的是，这里迄今仍未摆脱战争和冲突。中东向何处去？这是世界屡屡提及的“中东之问”。少一些冲突和苦难，多一点安宁和尊严，这是中东人民的向往。, 有一位阿拉伯诗人曾说：“当你面向太阳的时候，你定会看到自己的希望。”中东蕴含希望，各方要在追求对话和发展的道路上寻找希望。, ——化解分歧，关键要加强对话。武力不是解决问题之道，零和思维无法带来持久安全。对话过程虽然漫长，甚至可能出现反复，但后遗症最小，结果也最可持续。冲突各方应该开启对话，把最大公约数找出来，在推进政治解决上形成聚焦。国际社会应该尊重当事方、周边国家、地区组织意愿和作用，而非从外部强加解决方案，要为对话保持最大耐心，留出最大空间。, ——破解难题，关键要加快发展。中东动荡，根源出在发展，出路最终也要靠发展。发展事关人民生活和尊严。这是一场同时间的赛跑，是希望和失望的较量。只有让青年人在发展中获得生活的尊严，在他们的心中，希望才能跑赢失望，才会自觉拒绝暴力，远离极端思潮和恐怖主义。, ——道路选择，关键要符合国情。现代化不是单选题。历史条件的多样性，决定了各国选择发展道路的多样性。阿拉伯谚语讲：“自己的指甲才知道哪里痒”。在发展道路的探索上，照搬没有出路，模仿容易迷失，实践才出真知。一个国家的发展道路，只能由这个国家的人民，依据自己的历史传承、文化传统、经济社会发展水平来决定。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 阿盟是阿拉伯国家团结的象征。维护巴勒斯坦人民合法民族权益是阿盟的神圣使命，也是国际社会的共同责任。巴勒斯坦问题不应被边缘化，更不应被世界遗忘。巴勒斯坦问题是中东和平的根源性问题。国际社会定分止争，既要推动复谈、落实和约，也要主持公道、伸张正义，二者缺一不可。没有公道，和约只能带来冰冷的和平。国际社会应该坚持以公道为念、以正义为基，尽快纠正历史不公。, 我愿在此呼吁，国际社会采取更强有力行动，在政治上激活和谈进程，在经济上推进重建进程，让巴勒斯坦人民早日看到希望。中国坚定支持中东和平进程，支持建立以1967年边界为基础、以东耶路撒冷为首都、享有完全主权的巴勒斯坦国。我们理解巴勒斯坦以国家身份融入国际社会的正当诉求，支持建立新的中东问题促和机制，支持阿盟、伊斯兰合作组织为此作出的努力。为改善巴勒斯坦民生，中国决定向巴方提供5000万元人民币无偿援助，并将为巴勒斯坦太阳能电站建设项目提供支持。, 叙利亚现状不可持续，冲突不会有赢家，受苦的是地区人民。解决热点问题，停火是当务之急，政治对话是根本之道，人道主义救援刻不容缓。中方今年将再向叙利亚、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、也门人民提供2.3亿元人民币人道主义援助。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 2014年6月，我在中阿合作论坛北京部长级会议上提出，中阿共建“一带一路”，构建以能源合作为主轴，以基础设施建设、贸易和投资便利化为两翼，以核能、航天卫星、新能源三大高新领域为突破口的“1+2+3”合作格局，阿拉伯朋友热烈响应。现在，我们已经有了早期收获。, ——顶层设计日臻成熟。中阿建立了政治战略对话机制，中国同8个阿拉伯国家建立了战略伙伴关系，同6个阿拉伯国家签署了共建“一带一路”协议，7个阿拉伯国家成为亚洲基础设施投资银行创始成员。, ——务实合作显露活力。中国是阿拉伯国家第二大贸易伙伴，新签对阿拉伯国家工程承包合同额464亿美元；海湾阿拉伯国家合作委员会重启对华自由贸易区谈判并取得实质性进展，阿拉伯国家建立了两家人民币清算中心，中阿双方成立两个共同投资基金；中阿技术转移中心正式揭牌成立，双方就建立和平利用核能培训中心、清洁能源培训中心、北斗卫星导航系统落地等达成一致；第二届中阿博览会签署合作项目金额1830亿元人民币，成为中阿共建“一带一路”的重要平台。, ——人文交流丰富多彩。我们举办了中阿友好年活动，签署了第一个共建联合大学协议，启动了百家文化机构对口合作，在华阿拉伯留学生突破14000人，在阿拉伯国家孔子学院增至11所，中阿每周往来航班增至183架次。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国坚持走和平发展道路，奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，实行互利共赢的对外开放战略，着力点之一就是积极主动参与全球治理，构建互利合作格局，承担国际责任义务，扩大同各国利益汇合，打造人类命运共同体。, 我们要抓住未来5年的关键时期共建“一带一路”，确立和平、创新、引领、治理、交融的行动理念，做中东和平的建设者、中东发展的推动者、中东工业化的助推者、中东稳定的支持者、中东民心交融的合作伙伴。, 中方愿同阿拉伯国家开展共建“一带一路”行动，推动中阿两大民族复兴形成更多交汇。, 第一，高举和平对话旗帜，开展促进稳定行动。“一带一路”建设，倡导不同民族、不同文化要“交而通”，而不是“交而恶”，彼此要多拆墙、少筑墙，把对话当作“黄金法则”用起来，大家一起做有来有往的邻居。, 中国古代圣贤孟子说：“立天下之正位，行天下之大道。”中国对中东的政策举措坚持从事情本身的是非曲直出发，坚持从中东人民根本利益出发。我们在中东不找代理人，而是劝和促谈；不搞势力范围，而是推动大家一起加入“一带一路”朋友圈；不谋求填补“真空”，而是编织互利共赢的合作伙伴网络。, 中国人有穷变通久的哲学，阿拉伯人也说“没有不变的常态”。我们尊重阿拉伯国家的变革诉求，支持阿拉伯国家自主探索发展道路。处理好改革发展稳定关系十分重要。这就好比阿拉伯喜闻乐见的赛骆驼，前半程跑得太快，后半程就可能体力透支；前半程跑得太慢，后半程又可能跟不上。骑手只有平衡好速度和耐力，才能够坚持到最后。, 恐怖主义和极端思潮泛滥，是对和平与发展的严峻考验。打击恐怖主义和极端势力，需要凝聚共识。恐怖主义不分国界，也没有好坏之分，反恐不能搞双重标准。同样，也不能把恐怖主义同特定民族宗教挂钩，那样只会制造民族宗教隔阂。没有哪一项政策能够单独完全奏效，反恐必须坚持综合施策、标本兼治。, 为此，中方将建立中阿改革发展研究中心；在中阿合作论坛框架内召开文明对话与去极端化圆桌会议，组织100名宗教界知名人士互访；加强中阿网络安全合作，切断暴力恐怖音视频网络传播渠道，共同参与制定网络空间国际反恐公约；提供3亿美元援助用于执法合作、警察培训等项目，帮助地区国家加强维护稳定能力建设。, 第二，推进结构调整，开展创新合作行动。日趋激烈的国际发展竞争，需要我们提高合作档次。要推进“油气+”合作新模式，挖掘合作新潜力。中方愿同阿方加强上中下游全产业链合作，续签长期购油协议，构建互惠互利、安全可靠、长期友好的中阿能源战略合作关系。要创新贸易和投资机制，拓展合作新空间。, 中国对外投资已经进入快车道，阿拉伯国家主权基金实力雄厚，我们可以更多签署本币互换、相互投资协议，扩大人民币结算业务规模，加快投资便利化进程，引导双方投资基金和社会资金参与“一带一路”重点项目。双方要加强高新领域合作、培育合作新动力，可以依托已经成立的技术转移、培训中心等，加快高铁、核能、航天、新能源、基因工程等高新技术落地进程，提高中阿务实合作含金量。, 为此，中方将实施创新合作行动，愿同阿方探索“石油、贷款、工程”一揽子合作模式，延伸传统油气合作链条，合作开发新能源、可再生能源；中方将参与中东工业园区建设，重点推进苏伊士经贸合作区建设，通过人员培训、共同规划、合作建厂等方式，实现加工制造、运输出口一体化；启动中阿科技伙伴计划，在现代农业、信息通信、人口健康等领域共建10个联合实验室；举办中阿北斗合作论坛。, 第三，促进中东工业化，开展产能对接行动。产能合作契合中东国家经济多元化大趋势，可以引领中东国家走出一条经济、民本、绿色的工业化新路。, 中国装备性价比高，加上技术转让、人才培训、强有力融资支持，可以帮助中东国家花较少的钱建立起钢铁、有色金属、建材、玻璃、汽车制造、电厂等急需产业，填补产业空白，培育新的比较优势。中方优势产能和中东人力资源相结合，可以创造更多更好的就业机会。, 今天上午，我出席了中埃苏伊士经贸合作区二期揭牌仪式，这一项目将引进纺织服装、石油装备、摩托、太阳能等100多家企业，可以为埃及创造1万多个就业机会。, 为促进中东工业化进程，中国将联合阿拉伯国家，共同实施产能对接行动，包括设立150亿美元的中东工业化专项贷款，用于同地区国家开展的产能合作、基础设施建设项目，同时向中东国家提供100亿美元商业性贷款，支持开展产能合作；提供100亿美元优惠性质贷款，并提高优惠贷款优惠度；同阿联酋、卡塔尔设立共计200亿美元共同投资基金，主要投资中东传统能源、基础设施建设、高端制造业等。, 第四，倡导文明交流互鉴，开展增进友好行动。文明具有多样性，就如同自然界物种的多样性一样，一同构成我们这个星球的生命本源。中东是人类古老文明的交汇之地，有着色彩斑斓的文明和文化多样性。中国将继续毫不动摇支持中东、阿拉伯国家维护民族文化传统，反对一切针对特定民族宗教的歧视和偏见。, 中华文明与阿拉伯文明各成体系、各具特色，但都包含有人类发展进步所积淀的共同理念和共同追求，都重视中道平和、忠恕宽容、自我约束等价值观念。我们应该开展文明对话，倡导包容互鉴，一起挖掘民族文化传统中积极处世之道同当今时代的共鸣点。, “一带一路”延伸之处，是人文交流聚集活跃之地。民心交融要绵绵用力，久久为功。昨天，我会见了获得“中阿友好杰出贡献奖”的10位阿拉伯老朋友。正是有一代接一代的友好人士辛勤耕耘，中阿友好的大树才能枝繁叶茂、四季常青。, 为了让人才和思想在“一带一路”上流动起来，我们将实施增进友好“百千万”工程，包括落实“丝路书香”设想，开展100部中阿典籍互译；加强智库对接，邀请100名专家学者互访；提供1000个阿拉伯青年领袖培训名额，邀请1500名阿拉伯政党领导人来华考察，培育中阿友好的青年使者和政治领军人物；提供1万个奖学金名额和1万个培训名额，落实1万名中阿艺术家互访。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 埃及谚语说：“比时间永恒的是金字塔。”在我看来，最永恒的是埃及人民崇尚变革、追求自由的伟大精神。今天的埃及承载着传承文明的希望，肩负着探索复兴道路的使命。中国坚定支持埃及政府和人民的努力，期待埃及成为地区稳定支柱和发展标杆。, 民族复兴的追梦路上，难免会经历曲折和痛苦，但只要路走对了，就不怕遥远。中国和阿拉伯国家要心手相连、并肩攀登，为深化中阿友好合作而努力！为人类和平与发展的崇高事业而共同奋斗！, 舒克拉！谢谢！, （新华社开罗1月21日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2016年01月22日 03 版）, ]",习近平：共同开创中阿关系的美好未来,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/28075098
