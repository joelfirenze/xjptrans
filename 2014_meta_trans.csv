The article is as follows:, sincere friends, partners in development, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, the Maldives is picturesque and has simple folk customs. Seeing is better than seeing it. I look forward to visiting this beautiful Indian Ocean island country. , China and Maldives have a long history of friendly exchanges. As early as the Ming Dynasty in China, Chinese navigator Zheng He led the fleet to the Maldives twice. Maldivian King Yusuf also sent messengers to China three times. Today, the National Museum of Male displays ancient Chinese porcelain and coins unearthed there, becoming a historical witness to the friendly exchanges between the two countries. , In 1972, China and Malaysia formally established diplomatic relations. For more than 40 years, the two sides have always respected each other, trusted each other, and supported each other. The relationship between the two countries can be regarded as a model of equal treatment, friendly relations, and mutually beneficial cooperation between large and small countries. In recent years, exchanges between China and Malaysia in various fields have become more frequent, and pragmatic cooperation has been continuously deepened. Bilateral trade maintained a rapid growth momentum, and tourism cooperation developed rapidly. China has been the largest source of tourists in the Maldives for four consecutive years. The Maldives has become a holiday destination and romantic paradise in the minds of the Chinese people, especially young people. China has provided the Maldives with support within its ability to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. Facts have proved that China and Malaysia are not only friends of sincere mutual trust and mutual help, but also partners for joint development and common prosperity. , ""The tide level is wide on both sides of the strait, and the wind is sailing."" At present, China-Malaysia relations are in a new upswing and face important development opportunities. We must seize the opportunity, take advantage of the momentum, consolidate the traditional friendship between China and Malaysia, deepen cooperation in various fields, and push China-Malaysia relations to a new level. Therefore, China and Malaysia should strengthen political mutual trust. China thanks the Maldives government for adhering to the one-China policy, and has consistently given China valuable support on issues involving China's core interests. China has always advocated that the country is equal regardless of its size, and will, as always, respect the Maldivian people's choice of political system and development path according to their own national conditions. , China and Malaysia should deepen pragmatic cooperation. China actively advocates building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Maldives is located in the main road of the Indian Ocean and is an important post on the ancient Maritime Silk Road. China welcomes Malaysia to give full play to its own advantages and actively participate in the construction of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. China is willing to work together with Malaysia to promote the vision of this cooperative initiative to be turned into reality as soon as possible, and drive the development and prosperity of all countries and the overall revitalization of Asia. , China and Malaysia should closely communicate with each other. After the broadcast of ""Charming Maldives"" filmed by China Central Television, more Chinese tourists came to Maldives to experience the charming scenery of coconut trees and clear waters. China also welcomes more Maldivian citizens to travel and study in China. China encourages the governments of the two countries to increase the convenience of personnel exchanges, and the airlines of the two countries open up more flights to truly ensure that China and Malaysia ""have no distance between each other, and thousands of miles are still neighbors."" , China and Malaysia should strengthen multilateral coordination. China regards the Maldives as an important partner in South Asia and the Indian Ocean and is willing to continue close cooperation with Malaysia in the fields of climate change and human rights. China is happy to see the Maldives make more voices in international and regional affairs and play a unique role. The China-Malaysia Friendship Boat has set sail. I believe that with the joint efforts of both parties, it will ride the wind and waves to a better tomorrow.

Five years ago, I visited Fiji through the border. The picturesque tropical scenery and hospitable people left me with an unforgettable impression and pleasant memories. Today, 5 years later, I will set foot on this beautiful land again. I am pleased to learn that Fiji’s economy continues to improve, social undertakings develop steadily, people’s lives continue to improve, and international exchanges become more active, showing a prosperous scene. Not long ago, Fiji successfully held a general election.

During this visit, I also have an important agenda for inviting leaders of Pacific island countries that have established diplomatic relations with China to meet in Fiji to discuss the development of China-Island relations and draw up a blueprint for friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides. Pacific island countries are important members of the Asia-Pacific family and an important part of developing countries.

3,83,"[, People's Daily Online, Beijing, November 19th] On November 19th, during a state visit to New Zealand, President Xi Jinping published the signature of ""New Zealand Herald"" in New Zealand entitled ""Commonly Depicting a Better Future of China-New Zealand Relations"" article. The article is as follows:, to jointly portray a better future for China-Singapore relations, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, on November 19, I will bring the Chinese people’s friendship to the people of New Zealand, and I look forward to developing China-New Zealand friendly relations. To expand my first visit to New Zealand since I assumed the presidency of the People’s Republic of China. , New Zealand is a dazzling pearl in the Pacific Ocean. There are hard-working, courageous and hospitable people. There is a fascinating natural scenery like a paradise, and there are rich products that are widely favored in the world market. This will be the third time I set foot on this beautiful land, and I am looking forward to this trip. , When it comes to China-Singapore relations, two moving pictures will always appear in my mind. In May 2008, a massive Sichuan earthquake occurred in Sichuan Province, China. In order to help the people in the disaster-stricken areas overcome difficulties, in Christchurch, New Zealand's South Island, a group of lovely children organized themselves to play the violin in the streets of the Southern Hemisphere in winter to raise money. In February 2011, the city of Christchurch also suffered an earthquake disaster. Hearing this unfortunate news, the China International Rescue Team rushed to participate in the rescue work and contributed to the search and rescue of the trapped people. At the critical moment, despite the distance between the oceans, the hearts of the people of the two countries are always connected, which is the epitome and vivid expression of the friendship between China and Singapore. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1972, China-Singapore relations have achieved historic development, and the two countries have achieved unprecedented breadth and depth in practical exchanges and cooperation in various fields. China and New Zealand have created many ""firsts"" in China's relations with developed countries. China has become New Zealand's largest trading partner and the largest source of foreign students, especially New Zealand is the first to sign and implement bilateral relations with China. Developed countries with free trade agreements. It can be said that from more high-quality and cheaper goods services to more jobs, from more convenient personnel to better learning opportunities, China-Singapore friendly cooperation has brought more and more attention to the two countries and peoples Benefits that can be seen and touched. The history of China-Singapore relations shows that mutual respect and equal treatment are the solid foundation for the healthy and stable development of relations between the two countries; complementary advantages and mutually beneficial and win-win results are a powerful driving force for the rapid expansion of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries; It is an inexhaustible source of bilateral relations that has always been at the forefront of relations between China and developed countries. The development of China-Singapore relations has gone beyond the bilateral scope, providing an example for countries to explore successful ways of getting along with each other. At present, both China and New Zealand are blowing the wind of reform and development. The Chinese people are striving for the realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. They are comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, and comprehensively advancing the rule of law. New Zealand is also focusing on enhancing international competitiveness, increasing infrastructure construction, increasing investment in technological innovation, and optimizing the economic structure. It can be said that the interests of China and New Zealand are constantly increasing. If we effectively link up our respective development strategies, the two sides will face rare opportunities to strengthen all-round cooperation and have very broad prospects. The new situation has given China and Singapore a new mission of friendship and cooperation. In order to better realize their respective development and prosperity, our two countries should join hands and jointly build a bright future for bilateral relations. , ——Efforts to create a new pattern of blending interests. China and Singapore should continue to promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields and build a community of interests in depth. Both sides should consolidate the foundation for cooperation in traditional fields such as agriculture and animal husbandry, while constantly creating new highlights of cooperation. China is in the field of infrastructure construction and manufacturing, and New Zealand has outstanding advantages in the fields of agricultural science and technology, information technology, and clean energy. The two countries can learn from each other and use each other's strengths. Both sides should insist on mutual benefit and win-win, keep the market open, and create a more friendly and fair environment for their respective companies to expand their markets and invest in other countries. , ——Efforts to create a new situation in cultural exchanges. The governments of China and Singapore should create more convenient conditions for expanding people's exchanges. More and more Chinese film and television works have chosen overseas shooting locations in New Zealand. The beautiful natural scenery and simple folk customs leave a good impression on Chinese audiences. I believe it will drive more Chinese people to travel to New Zealand. China and Singapore are negotiating a TV co-production agreement. The signing of this agreement will inject new impetus into the cultural exchanges between the two countries. , ——Efforts to promote a new level of multilateral coordination. Both China and Singapore are participants and builders of the current international system, and the two sides should strengthen cooperation. I congratulate New Zealand on its successful election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2015-2016, which reflects the international communityFang should strengthen cooperation. I congratulate New Zealand on its successful election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2015-2016, which reflects the importance the international community attaches to New Zealand’s international status and influence. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with New Zealand in international and regional mechanisms such as the United Nations, APEC, and Pacific Island Forum, promote the common interests of both sides, and work with the international community to maintain regional and world peace and stability. , Maori people have a famous saying: ""Happiness is in our own hands."" Sino-Singapore cooperation is about to start a new journey, and the future of China-Singapore relations is also in our own hands. During this visit, I look forward to discussing with the New Zealand government and all sectors of society on the two countries’ cooperation plan and jointly planning a blueprint for the development of bilateral relations.

4,84,"[, Dear Prime Minister Abbot, Dear Colleagues,: The G20 is the main forum for international economic cooperation and has an important mission to promote the stability and growth of the world economy. In the past few years, with our joint efforts, the world economy has gradually come out of the trough and has been developing in a good direction. At the same time, we must also see that the strength of economic recovery is not strong, there are risks in financial markets, and international trade is still hovering at a low level. International organizations predict that the world economy will grow by 3.3% this year and international trade will grow by 3.1%, both below the level before the international financial crisis. , Sailing against the current, retreating if not advancing. Our current primary task is to coordinate macroeconomic policies, jointly solve development problems, reduce economic risks, and achieve economic prosperity, financial stability, trade development, employment, and improvement of people's livelihood. , Not long ago, APEC made plans to promote growth in the Asia-Pacific region. I am pleased to see that the G20 is also making efforts to formulate a comprehensive growth strategy and set a target of an additional 2% growth on the existing policy level in the next five years, which is of great significance. To implement a comprehensive growth strategy, it is important to discover and nurture the driving force for sustained growth, and form a new situation in which countries develop and innovate, integrate interests, and link growth. To this end, I suggest the G20 to make efforts in the following three aspects. , First, innovative development methods. In response to the international financial crisis, we counteracted the cyclical stimulus policy to smooth out economic fluctuations. The short-term effect was obvious, but this is mostly a temporary solution. We must innovate development concepts, policies, and methods, and pay more attention to the quality and efficiency of growth, especially through structural reforms in the areas of finance, taxation, finance, investment, competition, trade, employment, and the combination of macroeconomic policies and social policies to create wealth. The dynamism of the economy burst out, allowing market forces to be fully released and pushing the economy from cyclic recovery to sustainable growth. In this regard, we must also pay attention to the pulling effect of infrastructure construction on the economy. During the hosting of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting, China made interconnection one of its core issues, with the goal of opening up new growth points. We support the establishment of the Global Infrastructure Center by the G20 and the establishment of the Global Infrastructure Fund by the World Bank. We will build the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, etc. Contribute to global infrastructure investment. Second, build an open world economy. World trade has expanded and all countries have benefited. The shrinking world market is not good for all countries. We must continue to be the standard bearer of global free trade, maintain the multilateral trading system, build a mutually beneficial and win-win global value chain, and cultivate global markets. We must continue to oppose trade and investment protectionism and promote the Doha Round negotiations. It is necessary to promote various free trade agreements to be open, inclusive, transparent, and non-discriminatory, and to avoid market fragmentation and trade system differentiation. , Third, improve global economic governance. This year is the 70th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Conference. All parties are summing up the experience of the Bretton Woods system to further improve global economic governance. We should take this opportunity to build a fair, just, inclusive and orderly international financial system, improve the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries, and ensure that all countries have equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal rules in international economic cooperation. It is necessary to accelerate and effectively implement the reform plan of the International Monetary Fund and strengthen the global financial safety net. The BRICS countries announced the establishment of development banks and emergency reserve arrangements, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank initiated by more than 20 countries in Asia is a useful supplement to the international financial system. , Colleagues! , China's economic growth is an important driving force for world economic growth. According to estimates by international organizations, China is one of the largest contributors to the comprehensive growth strategy of the G20. Such contributions stem from China's own policy measures to stabilize growth, adjust structure, promote reform, and benefit people's livelihood. China's growth strategy submitted to the G20 includes 134 such policy measures, which fully demonstrates China's determination, philosophy and actions to promote growth through reform. The Chinese economy will continue to maintain strong, sustainable, and balanced growth, with an annual increase equivalent to the economic scale of a moderately developed country. In the next five years, we will import more than US$10 trillion in commodities, and our foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion. These will provide more demand for the world economy and create more market opportunities, investment opportunities, and growth opportunities. As the host country of the G20 Leaders Summit in 2016, China is willing to make greater contributions and play a greater role in promoting world economic growth. , Taking this opportunity, I would like to announce that China will adopt the special standards for IMF data publication. ,Chang made greater contributions and played a greater role. , Taking this opportunity, I would like to announce that China will adopt the special standards for IMF data publication. , Colleagues! , Travel alone and travel far. Facing the various risks and challenges facing the world economy, G20 members should establish a sense of interest community and community of destiny, insist on being good friends and good partners, actively coordinate macroeconomic policies, and strive to form cooperation that promotes growth and complements each other. Win-win situation. Through such efforts, we will make the G20 go better and farther, and truly become a stabilizer of the world economy, a catalyst for global growth, and a propeller for global economic governance, so as to better benefit the people of all countries. , thank you all! , (Xinhua News Agency, Brisbane, Australia, November 15th), ""People's Daily"" (November 16, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Promote the development of innovation and achieve linked growth,1731,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-11-16,"[, 尊敬的阿博特总理，, 各位同事：, 二十国集团是开展国际经济合作的主要论坛，在促进世界经济稳定和增长方面肩负着重要使命。过去几年，在我们共同努力下，世界经济逐步走出低谷，不断朝好的方向发展。同时，我们也要看到，经济复苏之力并不强劲，金融市场还存在风险，国际贸易仍然在低位徘徊。国际组织预测今年世界经济增长3.3%，国际贸易增长3.1%，都低于国际金融危机前的水平。, 逆水行舟，不进则退。我们当前的首要任务，就是协调宏观经济政策，共同破解发展难题，减少经济风险，实现经济繁荣、金融稳定、贸易发展、就业和民生改善。, 不久前，亚太经合组织就推动亚太地区增长作出了规划。我高兴地看到，二十国集团也在作出努力，制定了全面增长战略，确立了未来5年在现有政策水平上额外增长2%的目标，这具有重要意义。, 落实全面增长战略，重要的是发掘和培育持久增长的动力，形成各国发展创新、利益融合、增长联动的新局面。为此，我建议二十国集团从以下3方面作出努力。, 第一，创新发展方式。应对国际金融危机期间，我们通过逆周期的刺激政策，熨平经济波动，短期效果明显，但这多是治标不治本。我们必须创新发展理念、政策、方式，更加重视增长质量和效益，特别是通过财税、金融、投资、竞争、贸易、就业等领域的结构改革，通过宏观经济政策和社会政策的结合，让创造财富的活力竞相迸发，让市场力量充分释放，推动经济从周期性复苏走向可持续性增长。, 在这方面，我们也要重视基础设施建设对经济的拉动效应。中方在主办亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议期间，将互联互通作为核心议题之一，目的就是开辟新的增长点。我们支持二十国集团成立全球基础设施中心，支持世界银行成立全球基础设施基金，并将通过建设丝绸之路经济带、21世纪海上丝绸之路、亚洲基础设施投资银行、丝路基金等途径，为全球基础设施投资作出贡献。, 第二，建设开放型世界经济。世界贸易扩大了，各国都受益。世界市场缩小了，对各国都没有好处。我们要继续做全球自由贸易的旗手，维护多边贸易体制，构建互利共赢的全球价值链，培育全球大市场。要继续反对贸易和投资保护主义，推动多哈回合谈判。要推动各种自由贸易协定做到开放、包容、透明、非歧视，避免市场分割和贸易体系分化。, 第三，完善全球经济治理。今年是布雷顿森林会议70周年，各方都在总结布雷顿森林体系的经验，进一步完善全球经济治理。我们要以此为契机，建设公平公正、包容有序的国际金融体系，提高新兴市场国家和发展中国家的代表性和发言权，确保各国在国际经济合作中权利平等、机会平等、规则平等。要加快并切实落实国际货币基金组织改革方案，加强全球金融安全网。金砖国家宣布成立开发银行和应急储备安排，亚洲二十多个国家发起建立的亚洲基础设施投资银行，这是对国际金融体系的有益补充。, 各位同事！, 中国经济增长是世界经济增长的重要动力。根据国际组织测算，中国是二十国集团全面增长战略的最大贡献者之一。这样的贡献，源自中国自身稳增长、调结构、促改革、惠民生的政策措施。中国向二十国集团提交的增长战略包括了134项这样的政策措施，充分展示了中国以改革促增长的决心、理念和行动。, 中国经济将继续保持强劲、可持续、平衡增长势头，每年增量相当于贡献了一个中等发达国家的经济规模。未来5年，我们将进口超过10万亿美元商品，对外投资超过5000亿美元。这些将为世界经济提供更多需求，创造更多市场机遇、投资机遇、增长机遇。作为2016年二十国集团领导人峰会主办国，中国愿意为推动世界经济增长作出更大贡献、发挥更大作用。, 借此机会，我愿宣布，中国将采纳国际货币基金组织数据公布特殊标准。, 各位同事！, 独行快，众行远。面对世界经济面临的各种风险和挑战，二十国集团成员要树立利益共同体和命运共同体意识，坚持做好朋友、好伙伴，积极协调宏观经济政策，努力形成各国增长相互促进、相得益彰的合作共赢格局。我们要通过这样的努力，让二十国集团走得更好更远，真正成为世界经济的稳定器、全球增长的催化器、全球经济治理的推进器，更好造福各国人民。, 谢谢大家！, （新华社澳大利亚布里斯班11月15日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年11月16日 02 版）, ]",习近平：推动创新发展  实现联动增长,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/26032955
5,85,"[, November 14th, on the occasion of going to Brisbane, Australia to attend the ninth summit of the leaders of the Group of Twenty and to pay a state visit to Australia, President Xi Jinping published the title of ""Creating China"" in the Australian Financial Review A signed article on ""A New Chapter in Australian Relations."" The article is as follows:, creating a more exciting new chapter in China-Australia relations, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, Australia, this magical continent has a beautiful and unique scenery, a booming economy, a vibrant people, a diverse symbiotic culture, deep It attracts the eyes of the world. , Since 1988, I have visited Australia 4 times. Every visit made me refreshed, and made me deeply feel the profound friendship between the people of China and Australia. I look forward to setting foot on this land for the fifth time, paying a state visit to Australia, and attending the ninth summit of the G20 leaders in Brisbane. , ""Aspirants, don't take mountains and seas as far away as possible."" Although China and Australia are far away from each other across the ocean, the bond between history and reality connects us closely. In the 42 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China-Australia relations have gone through an extraordinary process. The two countries have become good friends and strategic partners, and the people of the two countries have benefited a lot from it. The high-level exchanges between China and Australia and at all levels are close, and mutual political trust is constantly deepening. China and Australia have established an annual regular meeting mechanism for the Prime Minister, as well as more than 30 pairs of intergovernmental consultation mechanisms such as diplomacy and strategic dialogue, and strategic economic dialogue. Parliament, political parties, and military exchanges are active, and good communication and coordination are maintained in multilateral affairs. , China-Australia economic and trade and other pragmatic cooperation have achieved fruitful results, and the integration of interests has continued to deepen. Over the past 42 years, the scale of bilateral trade between China and Australia has increased by more than 1,500 times. China is Australia's largest trading partner, largest export market, and largest source of imports. For every 100 tons of iron ore imported by China, 54 tons come from Australia. For every AUD 3 of Australian export income, 1 AUD comes from China. Australia’s high-quality milk, meat products, and wine are also increasingly on the Chinese people’s tables. , Sino-Australian humanities exchanges are flourishing, and the friendship is deepening. China and Australia have successfully hosted each other's cultural year, and the ""Australia Fever"" and ""China Fever"" continue to heat up in both countries. China is Australia's largest source of tourism revenue, and Australia is firmly ranked as China's second largest overseas study destination. In 2013, the personnel exchanges between the two countries exceeded 1.5 million, and more than 200,000 Chinese students studied in Australia. During the development of China-Australia relations, many stories of friendly exchanges between the two countries have been left behind. In 1991, the Australian ophthalmology doctor Graham, known as the ""ambassador of light,"" visited China to perform surgery on many patients with eye diseases, so that they could see the light again. In 2009 and 2013, when severe mountain fires occurred in Victoria, New South Wales, and other places in Australia, China quickly provided Australia with satellite data on fire sites to assist the disaster relief operations. It was the people of the two countries who played one after another touching notes that brought together today's China-Australia friendship. , ""The elders who seek wood must fix their roots; those who desire to flow far must dredge their fountains."" China and Australia are located in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively, and belong to Eastern and Western cultures. The relationship between the two countries can reach today's heights. The important experience is that the two sides follow the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, enhance mutual trust through dialogue, achieve win-win through cooperation, and build friendship through exchanges. This is the right path for the development of China-Australia relations. It has been tested by history and recognized by the people of both countries. At present, China is comprehensively deepening reform and expanding opening up, comprehensively advancing the rule of law, and making unremitting efforts to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Australia is also accelerating economic restructuring and industrial upgrading to build a more powerful and prosperous country. On international and regional issues, the exchanges between the two countries have continued to expand and consensus has continued to increase. It can be said that China-Australia cooperation has sufficient endogenous power, outstanding strategic connotation, profound practical foundation and broad development prospects. , I look forward to this visit, to have in-depth exchanges with Australian leaders and friends from all walks of life, tap the potential for cooperation, build friendship, and join hands to open a more exciting new chapter in China-Australia relations. , We must enhance mutual understanding and consolidate the bond of mutual trust. To increase mutual trust between China and Australia, we must achieve harmony and differences, seek common ground while reserving differences, and set an example for peaceful coexistence and cooperation and win-win cooperation between countries with different cultural traditions, political systems, and stages of development. , We must deepen pragmatic cooperation and consolidate the bond of interests. China and Australia should give full play to their complementary economic advantages, open up new prospects for cooperation in traditional fields such as energy and resources, and create new growth points for cooperation in finance, infrastructure, agriculture, and animal husbandry to better serve their respective development and improve people's livelihood. , We want to encourage non-governmentalCreate new growth points for cooperation in finance, infrastructure, agriculture and animal husbandry to better serve the respective development of the two countries and the improvement of people's livelihood. , We must encourage people-to-people exchanges and consolidate humanities. We must continue to expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of education, culture, tourism, youth, and other fields of the two countries, tell Chinese stories and Australian stories, and allow China-Australia friendship to take root in the hearts of the two peoples. , We must strengthen strategic communication and consolidate the bonds of multilateral cooperation. China is willing to work with Australia to strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional mechanisms, work together to address various traditional and non-traditional security issues, and jointly maintain and promote peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. , Another important agenda for my visit to Australia this time is to attend the ninth summit of the G20 leaders in Brisbane. This November, China and Australia are the focus of attention of the international community. During the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting, China, together with Australia and other member economies, promoted regional economic integration, promoted economic innovation and development, centered on the theme of ""building a future-oriented Asia-Pacific partnership"". Reform, growth, strengthening of all-round infrastructure and interconnection construction have achieved positive results. , I look forward to continuing the good momentum of China-Australia cooperation, working with Prime Minister Abbott and other leaders of the G-20 member states to formulate a comprehensive growth strategy for the G20, through economic reform, infrastructure investment, and building an open world Economic and other measures to tap new growth points and promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. In the southern hemisphere in November, the sun is shining, and the Australian continent is full of vitality. China-Australia friendly cooperation has embarked on a new journey. As long as we work side by side and redouble our efforts, China-Australia relations will surely be more exciting in the future!

6,86,"[, On November 11, the 22nd APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting was held at the Yanqi Lake International Conference Center in Huairou, Beijing. President Xi Jinping chaired the meeting. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lan Hongguang, colleagues: I am very happy to meet you at the shore of Yanqi Lake in Beijing. First of all, I would like to express my warm welcome to all colleagues! Every year in spring and autumn, there are flocks of wild geese coming here, so Yanqi Lake gets its name. The 21 members of APEC are like 21 geese. ""Thousands of white waves are blowing in the wind, and the blue sky is the line of geese."" Today, we gathered at Yanqi Lake to strengthen cooperation, spread our wings, and write a new vision for Asia-Pacific development. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of APEC. The 25 years of APEC is also the 25 years of Asia-Pacific development and prosperity. APEC has witnessed the historical achievements of Asia-Pacific development, and Asia-Pacific development has also given APEC a new mission. At present, the world economic recovery is still faced with many unstable and uncertain factors, and the development of the Asia-Pacific region has also entered a new stage, with both opportunities and challenges. How to crack the fragmentation risk of regional economic cooperation? How to seek new growth drivers during the post-international financial crisis? How to solve the financing bottleneck that the interconnection construction faces? All these require us to think deeply and respond actively. Faced with the new situation, we should further promote regional economic integration and create an open pattern that is conducive to long-term development. APEC should play a leading and coordinating role, break down all kinds of shackles, and usher in a new round of large-scale opening-up, exchanges, and integration in the Asia-Pacific region on a larger scale, higher level, and deeper level. It is necessary to break the closed door within the Asia-Pacific and open the door to the world. While advancing the Bogor goal, we must vigorously advance the process of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, clarify the goal, direction, and road map, turn the vision into reality as soon as possible, and realize a highly open integration arrangement across the Pacific Ocean. Faced with the new situation, we should fully promote reform and innovation, tap new growth points and driving forces, and create a strong and sustainable growth pattern. During the post-international financial crisis, where did the growth driver come from? There is no doubt that motivation can only come from reform, innovation and adjustment. We need to innovate the development concept, change from the traditional factor-driven and export-driven to innovation-driven and reform-driven, and release endogenous power through structural adjustment. We must change the market management model so that the market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government. We must promote technological innovation, drive the energy revolution and consumption revolution, and promote the Asia-Pacific region to take the lead in realizing the new technology revolution in the world. This year, we promoted cooperation in the Internet economy, urbanization, blue economy and other fields, discussed the issue of crossing the ""middle income trap"", seized major and cutting-edge international economic issues, and made a good start. Faced with the new situation, we should speed up the improvement of infrastructure construction and create an all-round interconnection pattern. Connectivity is the road to our feet. No matter it is a road, railway, airway or network, wherever the road leads, our cooperation is where it is. Interconnection is a road of rules. With more coordination and cooperation and fewer rule obstacles, our logistics will be smoother and more convenient. Connectivity is a spiritual path. If you understand me and I understand you, the truth will become clearer and the things will become easier to handle. To achieve all-round connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region is to connect all members of the two sides of the Pacific with the road to the feet, the road to the rules, and the road to the soul, to overcome the bottlenecks of expensive financing and difficult financing. , Colleagues! APEC is a big family, and it is in the common interest of all members to create an open Asia-Pacific economic structure with development, innovation, growth linkage and integration of interests. In order to achieve the above goals, Asia-Pacific economies need to jointly build an Asia-Pacific partnership of mutual trust, inclusiveness, cooperation, and win-win results, and add momentum to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world. , First, jointly plan the development vision. The future development of the Asia-Pacific region is of interest to every member. We have reached an important consensus on starting the process of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, advancing interconnection, and seeking innovative development. We must translate the consensus into action, plan the development blueprint for the next 5, 10, or even 25 years, and move forward step by step. . , Second, jointly address global challenges. In the post-international financial crisis period, we must not only seize the core of economic growth, strengthen macro-policy coordination, but also properly respond to global issues such as epidemic diseases, food security, and energy security, and enhance mutual understanding through information sharing and exchange of experience. Share best practices, promote collective action through communication and coordination, and deepen regional cooperation with mutual help. , Third, commonEnhance mutual understanding, share best practices through experience exchange, promote collective action through communication and coordination, and deepen regional cooperation with mutual assistance. , Third, jointly build a cooperation platform. A partner means one hero and three gangs, doing good things together and doing big things together. We should build APEC into an institutional platform to promote integration, a policy platform to strengthen experience exchange, an open platform against trade protectionism, a development platform for deepening economic and technological cooperation, and a platform for interconnection. The development and growth of APEC depends on the joint support of everyone. , I would like to announce here that China will donate US$10 million to support the APEC mechanism and capacity building and carry out pragmatic cooperation in various fields. Fourth, seek joint development together. Partnership means win-win cooperation and mutual learning. At present, some Asia-Pacific developing economies are facing more difficulties. Without their development, Asia-Pacific development will not be sustainable. We must increase financial and technical support to developing members, give full play to the distinctive characteristics of Asia-Pacific economies, complement each other's strengths, expand linkage effects, and achieve common development. In the next three years, the Chinese government will provide 1500 training places for APEC developing members for capacity building projects in trade and investment. , Colleagues! , Under the theme of ""Building a Future-oriented Asia-Pacific Partnership"", we will focus on ""promoting regional economic integration"", ""promoting economic innovation and development, reform and growth"", and ""strengthening comprehensive infrastructure and interconnection construction"" Discuss key issues. I look forward to and believe that this meeting will inject new vitality into Asia-Pacific development. , One flower is not spring, so lone goose is difficult to travel.

This is a substantial step towards the realization of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, marking the official start of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area process and reflecting the confidence and determination of APEC members to promote regional economic integration. This achievement will raise the level of regional economic integration to a new height, and will also benefit the economies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, injecting new vitality into Asia-Pacific economic growth and the common development of all members. - We have also approved important cooperation initiatives in areas such as global value chains, supply chains, and capacity building, and we have issued a strong call to support the multilateral trading system and promote the early conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations. ——We recognize that the world economy has entered the stage of in-depth adjustment after the post-international financial crisis. The Asia-Pacific region must seize opportunities, face challenges, accelerate innovation and reform, and tap new driving forces and competitiveness for the development of the Asia-Pacific economy. We adopted the ""APEC Economic Innovation Development, Reform and Growth Consensus"" and decided to take economic reform, new economy, innovative growth, inclusive support, and urbanization as the five pillars, strengthen policy coordination and dialogue, promote pragmatic cooperation, experience sharing, Capacity building to achieve a virtuous cycle among innovation, reform, and growth, and further consolidate the status of the Asia-Pacific global economic engine. -We are determined to jointly explore the development path and development model suitable for our own reality, strengthen exchanges and mutual learning, enrich new ideas and ideas for Asia-Pacific development, and form a diversified development that goes hand in hand.

We appreciate the positive results achieved in the fields of blue economy, green economy, sustainable energy, SMEs, health, forestry, mining, food security, tourism, women and economy. -We all agree that strengthening all-round infrastructure and interconnection will help to open up a new source of economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and enhance competitiveness, which is in line with the common interests of all members and the needs of long-term development.

We will increase investment in accordance with the blueprint concept, build a comprehensive and multi-level composite Asia-Pacific interconnection network, and lay a solid foundation for the long-term development of the Asia-Pacific. -We decided to expand pragmatic cooperation in the field of infrastructure investment and financing, promote the public-private partnership model, and help the region solve the bottleneck in interconnection construction funds. We highly affirm the fundamental role of human mobility in interconnection, and decided to implement new initiatives such as cross-border education, business travel cards, and cross-border tourism to benefit more ordinary people on both sides of the Pacific. , ——We decided to jointly deal with large-scale epidemic, Business travel cards, cross-border tourism and other new initiatives to benefit more ordinary people on both sides of the Pacific. -We decided to jointly address global challenges such as pandemic diseases, terrorism, natural disasters, and climate change.

The article is as follows:, Working Together to Create a Prosperous and Prosperous Asian Century, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, 17 years ago, I visited India for the first time as an ancient and magical country. At that time, India was pursuing economic reforms, and economic development began to show new vitality. Mumbai, a commercial center, is prosperous, Bangalore, the ""Silicon Valley of India,"" has gained fame, and Bollywood movies and yoga are popular all over the world. The Indian people are full of longing for the future, and the ancient civilization has regained its youthful vitality. 17 years later, I am about to set foot on this beautiful land that I yearn for. Today, India has become a high-profile emerging market country and a major developing country, Asia’s third largest economy, the world’s second largest software exporter, and agricultural exporter. India is a member of organizations such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS countries. It plays an increasingly important role on the international and regional stage. The ""Indian Story"" is talkative. With the new government in power, India is blowing a strong new trend of development and reform. The confidence of the Indian people has multiplied, and the international community is looking forward to Indian opportunities. Since the beginning of the new century, China-India relations have developed tremendously. The two countries have established a strategic cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity. China has become India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade volume increasing from less than US$3 billion at the beginning of this century to nearly US$70 billion. Last year, the number of personnel exchanges between the two countries reached 820,000. The two sides have closely coordinated and cooperated on global issues such as climate change, food security, and energy security to effectively safeguard the common interests of the two countries and developing countries. Positive progress has been made in the border negotiations between the two countries, and the two sides have jointly maintained border areas and peace and tranquility. China-India relations have become one of the most dynamic and potential bilateral relations in the 21st century. , China-India relations can have today's situation, thanks to our insistence on intersecting with faith, constantly strengthening strategic communication, and enhancing mutual political trust; adhering to the integration of benefits, constantly expanding the scope of cooperation, and expanding the common interest cake; Encourage people-to-people exchanges and build a foundation for public relations between the two countries; insist on treating each other with sincerity, respect each other and take care of each other's concerns, and properly manage and handle problems and differences. At present, both China and India are at a critical stage of reform and development. The Chinese people are striving to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China is comprehensively deepening reforms, proposing the overall goal of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, advancing the modernization of the country’s governance system and governance capabilities, and has identified more than 330 important reform initiatives in 15 areas, which are being comprehensively promoted. The new Indian government led by Prime Minister Modi has established ten priorities such as reforming the bureaucracy and improving infrastructure, and is committed to building a united, strong and modern “outstanding India”. The Indian people are making every effort to achieve the development goals of the new era. Both China and India are faced with historic opportunities for development, and the dreams of national revival between China and India are in harmony. We must connect the development strategies of the two countries more closely and work together to pursue our common dream of strengthening the country and enriching the people. ——As emerging countries with various advantages, we should be closer development partners, learn from each other's strengths and develop together. China has rich experience in infrastructure construction and manufacturing, and is willing to play a role in the development of India in these fields. India’s information and pharmaceutical industries are well developed. We welcome Indian companies to explore the market in China and seek business opportunities. The combination of ""World Factory"" and ""World Office"" will form the most competitive production base and the most attractive consumer market. ——As the two major engines of the Asian economy, we should be partners in leading growth. I believe that ""Chinese energy"" and ""Indian wisdom"" will unleash great potential. We will jointly promote the construction of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, discuss the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative, and lead the sustainable growth of the Asian economy. ——As two important forces in the process of world multi-polarization, we should be global partners in strategic cooperation. Prime Minister Modi believes that China and India are ""two bodies and one spirit."" I agree with this. Although ""Chinese Dragon"" and ""Indian Elephant"" each have their own characteristics, they both advocate peace, fairness and justice. We must work together to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, improve and optimize international governance mechanisms and rules, and make it better adapt to the development of the times and the common needs of the international community. , As Mr. Deng Xiaoping said: The real ""Asian Century"" is to wait for the development of China, India and other neighboring countriesCommon needs with the international community. As Mr. Deng Xiaoping said: The real ""Asian Century"" will not arrive until China, India and other neighboring countries have developed. We are willing to shoulder the mission entrusted by the times and be an active promoter of China-India friendship. I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with Indian leaders on Sino-Indian relations during my visit, injecting new impetus into the strategic partnership of cooperation between China and India for peace and prosperity. , I believe that as long as China and India work together, a prosperous and revitalized Asian century will surely come soon!

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 57 years ago, China-Sri Lanka relations have been developing healthily and steadily, becoming a model of friendly cooperation and mutual benefit between large and small countries. Bilateral trade volume has increased more than 10 times in the past 10 years. China has become Sri Lanka's second largest trading partner and second largest source of imports. The number of personnel exchanges between the two countries exceeded 110,000 last year and will continue to increase substantially in the coming years. Chinese enterprises have actively participated in the construction of a series of infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, making positive contributions to Sri Lanka's economic development and improvement of people's livelihood. , Last year, China and Sri Lanka established a strategic partnership of sincere mutual assistance and friendship from generation to generation, marking a new stage of development in relations between the two countries. China-Sri Lanka relations are at the best period in history and are facing new opportunities for development. Through this visit, I look forward to in-depth exchanges of views on bilateral relations and issues of common interest with President Rajapaksa, other leaders of Sri Lanka, and people from all walks of life, to consolidate the strategic partnership of cooperation between the two countries and work together for common development and a better future. , ——We must connect development strategies and be dream partners in the same boat. The ""Mahinda Vision"" shows Sri Lanka's dream of becoming a strong country and enriching the people, and is closely linked to the Chinese dream of the Chinese people pursuing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Sri Lanka wants to build five major centers of maritime, aviation, commercial, energy, and knowledge, which coincides with China's initiative to build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It is often said in Buddhism that everything is based on ""wishes"", the greater the ""wishes"", the greater the power. Both China and Slovakia should turn their wishes into motivation, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the fields of ocean, economy and trade, infrastructure construction, defense, tourism, and jointly promote the renaissance of the Maritime Silk Road and benefit both countries and peoples. -We must consolidate good-neighborly friendship and be a mutually beneficial development partner. Sri Lankan proverb says that teaching people to learn how to fish will keep them from hunger forever. China will implement the surrounding diplomatic concept of pro-honesty, sincerity, benefit and tolerance in all areas of cooperation with Sri Lanka, and strive to make China's development better for the people of Sri Lanka. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity for Sri Lanka's economic and social development, and promote the development of Sri Lanka's industry and the improvement of people's lives. The Hambantota port and Putram coal-fired power station undertaken by Chinese companies in Sri Lanka will help Sri Lanka enhance its development capabilities. -We must strengthen strategic cooperation and provide strong backing for mutual support. Both China and Slovakia need to strive for a peaceful, stable and friendly international environment for domestic construction. China will adhere to and promote the five principles of peaceful coexistence, strengthen coordination and cooperation with Sri Lanka in international and regional affairs, and safeguard the common interests of the two countries and developing countries. China thanks Sri Lanka for its valuable support on issues involving China's core interests, firmly supports Sri Lanka's development path in line with its own national conditions, firmly supports Sri Lanka's efforts to safeguard national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly opposes any country's interference in Sri Lanka under any pretext. internal affairs. , ——We must build a bridge of friendship and be true friends who know each other. As the old Chinese saying goes: ""People know each other, but they should know each other."" Since ancient times, the people of China and Slovakia have friendly exchanges and support each other, leaving many historical stories. In recent years, more and more people with eye diseases in China have accepted corneal donations from Sri Lanka's eye bank. The Chinese people's sincere friendship towards the people of Sri Lanka is in their hearts. Recently, ""Charming Sri Lanka"" co-produced by China Central Television and the Sri Lanka Tourism Bureau is being broadcast in China. More and more Chinese people will embark on this beautiful""Charming Sri Lanka"" co-produced by China Central Television and the Sri Lanka Tourism Bureau is being broadcast in China, and more and more Chinese people will set foot on this beautiful land. We must continue to explore the profound historical and cultural accumulation of the two countries, continuously expand exchanges and cooperation in culture, education, religion, youth, women, and localities, and promote the cultural integration and popular communication between the two countries. , ""The sea is wide by leaps and bounds, and the sky is high and the birds fly."" I believe that the boat of friendship and cooperation between China and Slovakia is bound to ride the wind and waves on the magnificent 21st century Maritime Silk Road and pursue the dream of national development.

10,90,"[, August 21st, on the occasion of a state visit to Mongolia, President Xi Jinping published at the same time in Mongolia’s ""Daily News"", ""Today"", ""Century News"", ""National Post"", Mongolia News Network website The signed article entitled ""Cerma runs towards a better tomorrow in China-Mongolia relations"". The article is as follows:, Zema runs towards a better tomorrow for China-Mongolia relations, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, for the friendly neighboring Mongolia, people naturally think of ""the sky is vast, the wilderness is vast, the wind and the grass is low, and the cattle and sheep are low"" Magnificence and vastness are the industriousness and bravery of the horseback people, and the wonderful competition and singing and dancing at the Nadam Conference. In 2008, I visited Mongolia and left a very good impression. , After a lapse of 6 years, at the invitation of President Erbegdorj, I will pay a state visit to Mongolia and set foot on this beautiful land again. I am very happy and looking forward to this visit of relatives. I hope that this visit will serve as an important opportunity to push bilateral relations to a new level. This year is the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia, the 20th anniversary of the revision of the China-Mongolia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and the year of China-Mongolia friendship and exchange. It has special significance for both countries and peoples. , ""A good horse is not afraid of Lu Yuan, and good friends are not afraid of difficulties."" Looking back on the 65-year history of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, friendship and cooperation are the main theme of Sino-Mongolian relations. In particular, since the 1990s, the development of relations between the two countries has entered a fast track, high-level visits between the two sides have been frequent, political mutual trust has continued to deepen, and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have continued to expand. China has maintained Mongolia's status as the largest trading partner and the largest source of investment for many years. In 2013, there were about 1.3 million people exchanges between the two countries, of which Mongolian citizens came to China more than 1 million. The deepening of strategic mutual trust, the continued close integration of interests, and the ever-closer national feelings are the precious wealth accumulated by the joint efforts of the people of China and Mongolia over the past 65 years. Today, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, and the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is even stronger. China has established its future development goals, that is, to build a well-off society in an all-round way by 2020, and to build a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The people of Mongolia are also struggling on the road of reform and development, and the country's development is showing a prosperous scene. Under such a general environment, it can be said that it is a matter of time, location and harmony to continue to deepen the development of Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation. Tianshi is a strategic fit between China and Mongolia. China puts forward the concept of developing friendly relations with neighboring countries, such as closeness, honesty, benefit and tolerance, and emphasizes that China should benefit neighboring countries including Mongolia. In recent years, Mongolia has reached a broad consensus on the development of relations with China, and regards the development of Sino-Mongolian relations as the priority direction of its foreign policy. Geographical location is the geographical proximity and economic complementarity between China and Mongolia. Mongolia is rich in resources and rich in resources. China's rapid development and strong capital and technology can provide Mongolia with all-round support in capital, technology, channels and markets. There is a broad space for cooperation between the two sides. ""Peace and harmony"" means that the friendship between the two peoples has a long history and deep feelings. In recent years, people-to-people and cultural exchanges have continued to expand, the peoples of the two countries have become closer to each other, and look forward to the future of bilateral relations. , Distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. China and Mongolia have a border of more than 4,700 kilometers, which is the longest land border between China and neighboring countries. Such a close geographical relationship provides unique conditions for Sino-Mongolian cooperation. The strong support of the governments and peoples of the two countries has injected momentum into the development of Sino-Mongolian relations. I think that China and Mongolia are not only geographically close neighbors, but also good neighbors in action and friendly neighbors in emotion. Now, China-Mongolia relations are standing at a new historical starting point. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share my four-point vision for China-Mongolia relations. -China and Mongolia should become reliable and responsible strategic partners. The development of Sino-Mongolian relations to today's level is hard-won and deserves our cherish. Both sides should grasp the general direction of bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective. Since last year, I have met with President Lebegdorj, Chairman Enkhbold and Prime Minister Altan Huyag. When I met Mongolian friends, I always emphasized that China respects Mongolia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. China adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs and will not impose its will on others. China sincerely hopes to work with Mongolia, based on respect for each other’s development path and support for each other’s core interests, to work hand in hand to stabilize the path of peaceful development. -China and Mongolia should be mutually beneficial partners that can be shared and seek win-win results. The highly complementary economies of China and Mongolia determine that mutual benefit is the basic feature of bilateral cooperation. inChina and Mongolia should be mutually beneficial partners that can share and seek win-win results. The highly complementary economies of China and Mongolia determine that mutual benefit is the basic feature of bilateral cooperation. When cooperating with the Mongolian side, China will always insist on a win-win situation, and never let me win you and lose, and I will lose more. Only by insisting on mutual benefit can cooperation last for a long time, and can there be an impetus for further development. This is the advantage of China-Mongolia cooperation. China hopes to promote China-Mongolia cooperation on railways, highway interconnection construction, mineral development and deep processing projects, as soon as possible to transform the advantages of cooperation into economic benefits, so that the two peoples can get more benefits. I am happy to see that the projects such as the Heping Bridge and the department store aided by China have played an important role in the Mongolian economy and society. In the future, China will continue to provide support to Mongolia's development under its ability. ——China and Mongolia should be friendly friends who can communicate with each other. The closer the relatives are, the deeper the friends. The people of China and Mongolia have always spoken of friendship and valued feelings. We should deepen mutual understanding and friendly feelings between the two peoples. This year is the year of friendly exchanges between China and Mongolia. The two countries will hold cultural weeks and hold a variety of activities such as China-Mongolia friendship exchange knowledge contest, China-Mongolia song singing contest, Chinese character calligraphy contest, and sports events. We look forward to more exchanges between the two peoples China keeps narrowing the distance between heart and heart. China is willing to continue to strengthen cooperation with Mongolia in various fields such as media, tourism, environmental protection, and Chinese language teaching. We also welcome more Mongolian friends to visit and take a look at China. -China and Mongolia should be partners that can work together to promote peace. Both China and Mongolia are developing countries and have the same or similar positions on many international and regional issues. China supports Mongolia to play a more active role in international and regional affairs, maintain regional peace and stability, and promote common development. China supports Mongolia’s accession to APEC and is willing to strengthen cooperation with Mongolia within the framework of international and regional organizations such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asia-Europe Meeting, the AsiaInfo Conference, and the Big Picture Initiative. China attaches great importance to the ""Ulaanbaatar Dialogue"" initiative of Northeast Asia security proposed by Mongolia and is willing to maintain communication with Mongolia on this. Historically, the ""Prairie Silk Road"" and ""Tea Road"" have passed through Mongolia. China has proposed initiatives to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and both parties can jointly study how to cooperate. During the visit, I will fully exchange views with Mongolian leaders such as President Erbegdorj on issues of common concern, jointly plan the future development of relations between the two countries, and push the relations between the two countries to a new level. We have reason and confidence to look forward to a better tomorrow for the development of China-Mongolia relations, let holy Hada pass on the friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia for generations, and let the vast grasslands carry the dream of common development between China and Mongolia.

11,91,"[, Dear President Rousseff, Dear President Solis, Dear Colleagues, Hello everyone! I am very happy to be here with you to discuss the development of China-Latin America relations. Thank you President Rousseff for his warm speech. I am very happy to see so many new and old friends from Latin America and the Caribbean. This afternoon is ""China-Latin America time"". The fact that so many leaders of China and Latin America can come together is a historical event with world influence. On this occasion, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to you and through you to the people of Latin America and the Caribbean! , Colleagues! This is the second time in more than a year that I have served as the President of China, I have visited relatives and friends in Latin America and the Caribbean, and participated in the first China-Latin America and Caribbean countries leaders meeting. China's proposal to hold this meeting is to strengthen dialogue, build consensus, and push China-Latin America relations to a higher level from the highest level. This is not only in line with the real and long-term interests of our two sides, but also conducive to promoting South-South cooperation. , Thanks to President Rousseff and the Brazilian government, while hosting the World Cup and the BRICS leaders’ meeting, they attached great importance to and carefully planned this important meeting. The member states of the Latin American ""troika"" have done a lot of coordination work before, and colleagues came to attend the meeting, which fully embodies the support for strengthening China-Latin America relations and promoting overall cooperation. I am deeply appreciative and grateful for this. , Colleagues! , ""Aspirants, don't take mountains and seas as far away as possible."" China and Latin America are far apart, but the people of both sides have a natural sense of closeness. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, with the joint efforts of several generations, China-Latin America relations have gone step by step, and have gone through a glorious course of more than 60 years. Since the new century, China-Latin America relations have shown a good momentum of comprehensive and rapid development. In particular, after the outbreak of the international financial crisis in 2008, China and Latin America have exerted their respective advantages and worked together to overcome the difficulties. The relationship between the two sides has achieved leapfrog development. At present, China-Latin America relations are at the best period in history and they are standing at a new historical starting point. China and Latin America face better opportunities, better foundations and better conditions for deepening all-round mutually beneficial cooperation. There is every reason to achieve greater development. Here, I propose that through this meeting, we will jointly announce the establishment of equality, mutual benefit and common development of a comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Latin America, and strive to build sincere political mutual trust, win-win cooperation in economic and trade cooperation, mutual learning in humanities, and international affairs. The five-in-one new pattern of Sino-Latin American relations with China's close cooperation, overall cooperation and mutual promotion of bilateral relations. To this end, I make the following five suggestions. First, insist on treating each other as equals and always help each other sincerely. Road determines fate. China and Latin America should firmly support each other on the development path that suits their respective national conditions, strengthen the exchange of governance experience, deepen strategic mutual trust, and continue to understand and support each other on core interests and major concerns involving national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and stable development. China reiterates its support for Latin America to promote regional integration, achieve joint self-improvement, and play a greater role in regional and international affairs. Second, adhere to mutually beneficial cooperation and promote common development. China and Latin America have strong economic complementarities, their development strategies are compatible, and strengthening cooperation has natural advantages. China proposes that both parties jointly build a new ""1+3+6"" cooperation framework to promote the comprehensive and in-depth development of China-Latin America pragmatic cooperation on the fast lane. , ""1"" is ""one plan"", that is, to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development as the goal, formulate ""China and Latin American and Caribbean countries cooperation plan (2015-2019)"", to achieve their respective development strategies. ""3"" is the ""three engines"", that is, to promote the comprehensive development of pragmatic cooperation between China and Latin America with trade, investment and financial cooperation as the driving force. Both sides should give play to the important role of trade in promoting the economic growth of China and Latin America, optimize the trade structure, promote the export of traditional superior products and high value-added products of Latin American countries to China, and expand cooperation in service trade, e-commerce, and strive to achieve China within 10 years. The scale of the Latin American trade reached 500 billion US dollars. , Both sides should expand mutual investment, promote investment diversification, and guide more capital to flow into productive fields. The Chinese government encourages and supports more Chinese companies to invest in Latin America, and strives to achieve a US$250 billion investment stock in Latin America within 10 years. The two sides should strengthen financial cooperation, support close coordination and cooperation between the central banks, promote the expansion of bilateral currency settlement and exchange of local currencies, and encourage banks of both sides to set up branches. ""6"" is the ""six major areas"", that is, to focus on cooperation in energy resources, infrastructure construction, agriculture, manufacturing, scientific and technological innovation, and information technology, to promote China-Latin America industrial docking and promote the in-depth development of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America. , To promote doubleAgriculture, manufacturing, scientific and technological innovation, and information technology are the key points of cooperation, promoting the integration of Chinese and Latin American industries and promoting the in-depth development of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America. In order to promote mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties in the above-mentioned fields, I would like to announce here that China will formally implement a US$10 billion special loan for China-Latin America infrastructure, and on this basis will increase the special loan amount to US$20 billion. China will also provide US$10 billion in preferential loans to Latin American and Caribbean countries, fully launch the China-Latin America Cooperation Fund and pledge to invest US$5 billion, mainly for energy resources, agriculture, manufacturing, high-tech, sustainable development and other fields of cooperation . China will also formally implement a US$50 million special fund for China-Latin America agricultural cooperation, establish the ""China-Latin America Science and Technology Partnership Program"" and ""China-Latin America Young Scientist Exchange Program"", and hold the first China-Latin America Science and Technology Innovation Forum in due course. Thirdly, insist on exchanges and mutual learning to consolidate friendship between generations. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date. China is willing to strengthen exchanges with the Latin American countries in government, legislative bodies, political parties, and localities, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in education, culture, sports, news, tourism, and other fields, and carry out civilized dialogues, so that the two peoples can appreciate each other culturally, and be close to each other. China-Latin America relations will develop the basis of public opinion in the long run. , I'd like to announce here that in the next five years, China will provide 6,000 government scholarships, 6,000 training places to China and 400 in-service master's places to Latin American and Caribbean countries, and invite 1,000 political leaders from Latin American and Caribbean countries China visited and exchanged and launched the “Bridge of the Future” training program for thousands of young leaders of China and Latin America in 2015. China proposes to hold the ""China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year"" in 2016. Fourth, adhere to international cooperation and safeguard common interests. Strengthening coordination and cooperation in global affairs between China and Latin America is of great significance to promoting the democratization of international relations and the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.

12,92,"[, On July 15, President Xi Jinping attended the sixth meeting of BRICS leaders in Fortaleza, Brazil, and delivered an important speech. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lan Hongguang, distinguished President Rousseff, President Putin, Prime Minister Modi, President Zuma,, ladies and gentlemen, friends:, very happy to be with you in the beautiful seaport city of Fortaleza meeting. Thank you President Rousseff and the Brazilian government for their thoughtful arrangements for today's meeting. Prime Minister Modi is welcome to attend the BRICS leaders' meeting. Congratulations to Brazil for hosting a successful and exciting World Cup football match. In the five years since the first meeting of the leaders of the BRICS countries, the BRICS countries have jointly voiced and contributed to many major international and regional issues, and are committed to promoting world economic growth, improving global economic governance, and promoting the democratization of international relations to become international relations. An important force in China and an active builder of the international system. Over the past five years, the BRICS countries have fully cooperated in all fields, covering many fields such as economy, finance, trade, society, humanities, science and technology, and brought tangible benefits to the people of all countries. The foundation for cooperation has become more solid. Five years of practice have proved that although our five countries are far apart, we have the same voice and the same desire, and we have the ambition to live in the mountains. , Colleagues! , BRICS cooperation is a historical process of continuous progress. We must plan a new blueprint for cooperation on the basis of summing up experience. In my opinion, this blueprint is to develop a closer, more comprehensive and stronger partnership among BRICS countries. , This requires us to carry forward the unique cooperative spirit of the BRICS countries. We should adhere to the spirit of openness, give play to our respective comparative advantages, strengthen mutual economic cooperation, cultivate a large global market, improve the global value chain, and be a builder of an open world economy. We should adhere to the spirit of tolerance, promote the mutual tolerance of different social systems, the mutual learning of different cultures and civilizations, and the mutual benefits of different development models, and be practitioners of the democratization of international relations. We should uphold the spirit of cooperation, continue to strengthen unity, take care of each other’s concerns, deepen pragmatic cooperation, join hands for the growth of the economies of all countries, and provide impetus for the improvement of global governance. We should adhere to a win-win spirit, take into account the interests of other countries while pursuing the interests of our own country, benefit the country and benefit the world, and promote a path of win-win cooperation and benign interaction between major powers. , Specifically, we should make efforts in the following aspects. First, unswervingly promote sustainable economic growth. The economic growth of the BRICS countries has slowed down recently, which is not only related to external factors, but also an objective result of countries' economic restructuring. Next, we should strengthen the endogenous power through necessary economic reforms to maintain stable economic growth. We should adhere to the concept of inclusive growth, use social policies to support macroeconomic policies, weave a social safety net, and promote economic growth from quantitative growth to qualitative improvement. We should coordinate economic development, social development, and environmental protection, and expand more space for economic development. Second, unswervingly carry out all-round economic cooperation. The resource endowments and industrial structure of the BRICS countries are diverse and complementary, and the cooperation potential is huge. We should establish a closer economic partnership, explore the establishment of a large integrated market in the field of trade and investment, build multi-level and large circulation in the field of currency and finance, form a land, sea and air connection in the field of infrastructure construction, and promote the exchanges between peoples in the humanities field. We should solidly promote pragmatic cooperation, promote emergency reserve arrangements to be put into operation as soon as possible, give full play to the role of the Business Council and the Think Tank Council, strive for cooperation in various fields to obtain more early harvest results, and bring tangible benefits to people of all countries. With the joint efforts of all parties, we reached a consensus today on the establishment of the BRICS Development Bank. This is an important and far-reaching achievement in the BRICS cooperation process, and reflects the BRICS’s political will to unite, cooperate and develop together, which not only helps to increase the BRICS’ voice in international financial affairs, but also more important What can benefit us and the people of developing countries. Thank you all for supporting the BRICS Development Bank in Shanghai, China. We are willing to work closely with all parties and make full preparations to ensure that the bank starts as soon as possible. Third, unswervingly shape the favorable external development environment. The world economy has gradually stepped out of the trough, providing better external conditions for the development of BRICS countries. At the same time, the world economy is still not completely free from the impact of the international financial crisis, and the international community expects the BRICS countries to continue to maintain their development momentum. We should push the BRICS countries to continue to increase their share of the global economy, foreign trade, and international investment, and drive strong, sustainable, and balanced growth worldwide. We should promote the improvement of global economic governance and implement relevant consensus and decisions to increase the representation and voice of developing countries,Continued and balanced growth. We should promote the improvement of global economic governance, implement relevant consensus and decisions to increase the representativeness and voice of developing countries, and ensure that countries have equal opportunities, rules, and rights in international economic cooperation. We should promote the strengthening of global macroeconomic policy coordination and prevent changes in the economic policies of major economies from causing negative spillover effects to the BRICS countries. , Fourth, unswervingly improve moral appeal. BRICS countries are responsible for upholding justice, promoting justice, and committing to building a fair and just world, which is a positive energy in international relations. We should amplify this positive energy, jointly propose a plan in international affairs, extend justice, and practice equality. We should actively participate in the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, jointly safeguard international justice, and never allow any force to reverse the history of aggression. We should promote the establishment of a global partnership for development and allow the world’s poor to change their lives. As long as the people of the BRICS countries work hand in hand with the peoples of other countries in the world, the road of BRICS cooperation, South-South cooperation and human development will become wider and wider. , A Brazilian friend told me that there is a best-selling book called ""Brazil: The Country of the Future"", which contains good hopes for human civilization. I look forward to the BRICS countries becoming as prosperous, prosperous, democratic, and civilized as the countries envisioned in the book, and creating a better future with more diverse world economic growth and more democratic international relations. , Colleagues! , China is comprehensively deepening reforms, giving play to the decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources, better playing the role of the government, and striving to build a new open economic system. In 2013, China became the largest trading partner of 128 countries in the world, with annual imports of goods approaching US$ 2 trillion, foreign non-financial investment exceeding US$ 90 billion, and nearly 100 million outbound travels. These figures are still expanding and will create more demand and opportunities for world economic growth. , China's diplomacy has principles, values ​​friendship, morality and justice. With regard to relations between major powers, China advocates no conflict or confrontation, mutual respect, win-win cooperation, and jointly pursues the path of peaceful development. We value the cooperation of the BRICS countries as a priority in diplomacy and insist on being friends, brothers and partners with the BRICS countries. , I believe that a China with better development quality, more inclusive and sustainable, a China that promotes peace, development, cooperation and win-win in international relations, and a China that actively participates in the cooperation of BRICS countries will surely Continue to make greater contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting common development. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Fortaleza, Brazil, July 15th), ""People's Daily"" (July 17, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the sixth meeting of leaders of BRICS countries,2317,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-07-17,"[, 7月15日，国家主席习近平在巴西福塔莱萨出席金砖国家领导人第六次会晤并发表重要讲话。　　新华社记者 兰红光摄, 尊敬的罗塞夫总统，普京总统，莫迪总理，祖马总统，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴在美丽的海港城市福塔莱萨同大家会晤。感谢罗塞夫总统和巴西政府为今天会晤所作的周到安排。欢迎莫迪总理出席金砖国家领导人会晤。祝贺巴西举办了一届成功精彩的世界杯足球赛。, 金砖国家领导人首次举行会晤5年来，金砖国家在许多重大国际和地区问题上共同发声、贡献力量，致力于推动世界经济增长、完善全球经济治理、推动国际关系民主化，成为国际关系中的重要力量和国际体系的积极建设者。, 5年来，金砖国家各领域合作全面展开，涵盖经济、金融、贸易、社会、人文、科技等诸多领域，给各国人民带来实实在在的好处，合作基础更加坚实。, 5年的实践证明，我们五国虽相距遥远，但同声相应、同气相求，志之所趋，穷山距海不能限。, 各位同事！, 金砖国家合作是不断前进的历史进程。我们要在总结经验的基础上，规划新的合作蓝图。我认为，这个蓝图就是发展金砖国家更紧密、更全面、更牢固的伙伴关系。, 这要求我们发扬金砖国家独特的合作伙伴精神。我们应该坚持开放精神，发挥各自比较优势，加强相互经济合作，培育全球大市场，完善全球价值链，做开放型世界经济的建设者。我们应该坚持包容精神，推动不同社会制度互容、不同文化文明互鉴、不同发展模式互惠，做国际关系民主化的实践者。我们应该坚持合作精神，继续加强团结，照顾彼此关切，深化务实合作，携手为各国经济谋求增长，为完善全球治理提供动力。我们应该坚持共赢精神，在追求本国利益的同时兼顾别国利益，做到惠本国、利天下，推动走出一条大国合作共赢、良性互动的路子。, 具体说来，我们应该在以下几个方面作出努力。, 第一，坚定不移推动经济可持续增长。金砖国家经济增长近来有所放缓，这既同外部因素有关，也是各国调整经济结构的客观结果。下一步，我们应该通过必要的经济改革，增强内生动力，保持经济稳定增长。我们应该坚持包容性增长理念，用社会政策托底宏观经济政策，织牢社会安全网，推动经济从量的增长转向质的提升。我们应该协调经济发展、社会发展、环境保护，拓展更大经济发展空间。, 第二，坚定不移开展全方位经济合作。金砖国家资源禀赋、产业结构具有多样性和互补性，合作潜力巨大。我们应该建立更紧密经济伙伴关系，在贸易和投资领域探索建立一体化大市场，在货币金融方面构建多层次大流通，在基础设施建设领域形成陆海空大联通，在人文领域推动各国人民大交流。我们应该扎实推动务实合作，推动应急储备安排尽早投入运作，更多发挥工商理事会、智库理事会作用，争取各领域合作取得更多早期收获成果，给各国人民带来实实在在的好处。, 在各方共同努力下，我们今天就建立金砖国家开发银行达成共识。这是金砖国家合作进程中具有重要和深远意义的成果，体现了金砖国家团结合作、共同发展的政治意愿，不但有助于提高金砖国家在国际金融事务中的话语权，而且更重要的是能够造福我们和发展中国家人民。感谢大家支持金砖国家开发银行落户中国上海。我们愿同各方密切合作，做好充分准备，确保银行尽快启动。, 第三，坚定不移塑造有利外部发展环境。世界经济逐步走出低谷，为金砖国家发展提供了更好外部条件。同时，世界经济仍未完全摆脱国际金融危机影响，国际社会期待金砖国家继续保持发展势头。我们应该推动金砖国家在经济总量、对外贸易、国际投资等方面占全球比重继续上升，带动全球范围内的强劲、可持续、平衡增长。我们应该推动完善全球经济治理，把增加发展中国家代表性和发言权的有关共识和决定落到实处，确保各国在国际经济合作中机会平等、规则平等、权利平等。我们应该推动加强全球宏观经济政策协调，防范主要经济体经济政策变动给金砖国家带来负面外溢效应。, 第四，坚定不移提高道义感召力。金砖国家主持公道、弘扬正义，致力于建设公平公正的美好世界，是国际关系中的正能量。我们应该放大这种正能量，在国际事务中共同提出方案，伸张正义，践行平等。我们应该积极参与世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年纪念活动，共同维护国际公理，决不允许任何势力为侵略历史翻案。我们应该推动建立全球发展伙伴关系，让世界上的贫困人口改变生活面貌。只要金砖国家人民同世界各国人民携手同心，金砖合作、南南合作和人类发展之路就会越走越宽广。, 巴西朋友告诉我，有一本畅销书叫做《巴西：未来之国》，书中寄托了对人类文明的美好希望。我期待着金砖国家能够像书中憧憬的那样，共同成为繁荣、富强、民主、文明的未来之国，开创世界经济增长更加多元、国际关系更加民主的美好未来。, 各位同事！, 中国正在全面深化改革，发挥市场在资源配置中的决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，努力建设开放型经济新体制。2013年，中国成为全球128个国家的最大贸易伙伴，年货物进口额接近2万亿美元，对外非金融类投资超过900亿美元，出境旅游近1亿人次。这些数字还在扩大，将为世界经济增长创造更多需求和机会。, 中国外交有原则、重情谊、讲道义、谋公正。对大国关系，中国主张不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢，共同走和平发展之路。对金砖国家合作，我们尤为珍视，列为外交优先领域，坚持同金砖国家做好朋友、好兄弟、好伙伴。, 我相信，一个发展质量更好、更具包容性、更可持续的中国，一个在国际关系中倡导和平、发展、合作、共赢的中国，一个积极参与金砖国家合作的中国，必将继续为维护世界和平、促进共同发展作出更大贡献。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社巴西福塔莱萨7月15日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年07月17日 02 版）, ]",习近平在金砖国家领导人第六次会晤上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25291163
13,93,"[, Secretary of State Kerry, Finance Minister Jacob Lu,, guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends: Beijing in July, Liu Ye Cui Qing, Huai Hua Xiang Xiang. In this beautiful season, the sixth round of China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the fifth round of high-level consultations on Sino-US humanities exchanges opened in Beijing. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet you all. First of all, I would like to extend a warm welcome to American friends who came from afar! My sincere thanks to people from all walks of life in the two countries who have long cared for and supported the development of Sino-US relations! The Diaoyutai State Guesthouse where we are today has witnessed a series of major historical events in Sino-US relations. Kissinger’s secret visit to China, Nixon’s historic visit to China, and negotiations on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States are all closely related. The establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and the United States in 1979 was a major event that caused a sensation in the world at that time. It not only changed the pattern of international relations, but also opened a new era of exchanges and cooperation between the people of China and the United States. In the past 35 years, although Sino-US relations have gone through ups and downs, but overall it has moved forward and has achieved historic development. The two countries have established more than 90 intergovernmental dialogue mechanisms. The bilateral trade volume has increased more than 200 times, reaching more than 520 billion US dollars last year. The two-way investment stock has exceeded 100 billion US dollars. The two countries have established 41 pairs of friendly provinces and states and 202 pairs of friendly cities. The personnel exchanges between the two countries exceed 4 million people every year. Sino-US cooperation not only benefits the peoples of China and the United States, but also promotes peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. As early as 1979, Mr. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The interests of the two peoples and the interests of world peace require us to look at China-US relations from a long-term strategic point of view of the overall situation of the international situation. Today, China and the United States account for one third of the world's total economy, one quarter of the world's population, and one fifth of the world's total trade. Moreover, the interests of China and the United States are deeply intertwined. Both history and reality show that cooperation between China and the United States is beneficial to both sides, and fighting is hurting both. Sino-US cooperation can be a major event beneficial to the two countries and the world. The confrontation between China and the United States is definitely a disaster for the two countries and the world. In such a situation, both of us should ascend to the horizon, strengthen cooperation, persist in cooperation, and avoid confrontation, which will benefit both countries and help the world. Nearly 1,000 years ago, Chinese writer Su Shi of the Song Dynasty said: ""You can't be lost if you are here, and you can't be lost when you are here."" The development of Sino-US relations should keep pace with the times and keep pace with the times. Over the past 35 years, despite profound changes in the international environment and the respective national conditions of our two countries, Sino-US relations can overcome difficulties and keep moving forward. The reason is that generations of leaders of the two countries have accurately grasped the pulse of the times and have constantly given new Connotation and motivation. Today, both of us should review the situation, change our thinking, innovate our thinking, and constantly create a new situation of cooperation between the two countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Last summer, President Obama and I held a historic meeting at the Annaberg Manor in California, USA, and reached an important consensus on working together to build a new type of relationship between China and the United States. Since then, when I met with President Obama in St. Petersburg and The Hague, I reconfirmed this consensus. The establishment of a new type of relationship between major powers is a major strategic choice jointly made by the two parties on the basis of summing up historical experience, starting from the national conditions of the two countries and the world situation. Traditional law and political responsibility to create a new model for the development of relations between major powers. Over the past year, new progress has been made in the construction of new-style relations between China and the United States. The two countries continue to work together to cope with the impact of the international financial crisis and strive to promote the recovery of the world economy. The two countries have carried out close coordination on relevant international and regional issues as well as global issues, and have worked together to address challenges that are critical to the future and destiny of humanity. The two countries have deepened bilateral practical exchanges and cooperation in various fields to ensure that the two peoples continue to benefit from it. The construction of a new type of great power relationship between China and the United States is an unprecedented cause and a newcomer's cause. There is no ready-made experience and model to copy it. It is not surprising that some difficulties and even twists and turns appear. It’s not terrible to have a problem. The key is that we should solve the problem together without being led by the problem. Looking forward to a period in the future, I would like to make a few comments and suggestions. , First, increase mutual trust and grasp the direction. How China and the United States judge each other's strategic intentions will directly affect what policies the two sides adopt and what kind of relationship they develop. You cannot make mistakes on this fundamental issue, otherwise you will make all mistakes. China has put forward the goal of ""two hundred years"" and is working hard to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. More than ever, a peaceful and stable external environment is needed. The Chinese people cherish peace, advocate ""peace is precious"", and advocate ""do not do what you don't want to do to others."" China will unswervingly remove peaceful developmentExternal environment. The Chinese people cherish peace, advocate ""peace is precious"", and advocate ""do not do what you don't want to do to others."" China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, firmly adhere to the surrounding diplomatic concept of pro, sincerity, benefit and tolerance, and is firmly committed to developing friendly relations with the region and other countries in the world. , ""The sky is high, the birds fly, the sea is wide and the fish jumps."" I always think that the broad Pacific has enough space to accommodate the two great powers of China and the United States. Both China and the United States should strengthen dialogue, increase trust and dispel doubts, promote cooperation, and ensure that Sino-US relations will never deviate from the track of building a new type of major power relationship. , Second, respect each other, gather together and alienate. China and the United States have different historical and cultural traditions, social systems, and ideologies. They have different levels of economic development. The two sides have different views, differences, and frictions on some issues. China and the United States are two countries with different characteristics. There must be differences in many aspects. Only when there are differences, communication and cooperation are necessary. Our two sides should insist on focusing on the big picture, grasp the overall goal of building a new type of major power relationship, and recognize that the common interests of the two countries far outweigh the differences; we should treat each other with equality, respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and respect each other’s choice of development path Do not impose your will and model on the other party; you should be good at managing contradictions and frictions, and insist on enhancing understanding and expanding consensus in a constructive way through dialogue and consultation. As long as both of us insist on mutual respect, assimilation and diversification, and maintain strategic patience, not to be confused by one thing or to be disturbed by one word, the overall situation of Sino-US relations will be able to sit on the Diaoyutai safely. , Third, equality and mutual benefit, and deepening cooperation. Under the new situation, China and the United States should cooperate and have wider fields of cooperation. Opportunities need to be created, and innovations have opportunities. As the saying goes, ""the smart people listen to silence, and the bright see the unseen."" Both China and the United States are creative nations. In advancing the development of relations between the two countries, they need to innovate in line with the development of the times. Both of us should innovate thinking, constantly tap the potential of cooperation, and cultivate highlights of cooperation. We should speed up the negotiation of bilateral investment agreements, strive for an early high-level, two-way balanced agreement, and promote the construction of Sino-US economic relations; we should deepen the dialogue between the two armed forces, improve the communication and cooperation mechanism, and promote the construction of Sino-US military relations; Strengthen dialogue and cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and jointly combat all forms of terrorism; we should give play to our respective advantages and assume our respective obligations and jointly address the global challenge of climate change; we should strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional issues to Make greater contributions to maintaining and promoting world peace, stability and prosperity. , Fourth, focus on the people and deepen friendship. The people of China and the United States have a simple and friendly feeling towards each other. The foundation of Sino-US friendship lies in the people, and hope in youth. I have visited the United States many times, and I have been a guest in the homes of ordinary Americans. I am deeply moved by the sincere hospitality of the American people. In today's era, economic globalization and social informatization are developing rapidly, but telephones and the Internet can never replace face-to-face communication and exchange. Friendship rooted in people's hearts is unbreakable. We must encourage and expand friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries, broaden exchange channels between the two localities, think tanks, media, youth, and all sectors of society, and continually strengthen the foundation of a friendly society and people between China and the United States. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Strategic and economic dialogues and high-level consultations on people-to-people exchanges are important platforms for the largest number of participating departments and widest discussion topics between China and the United States. This round of dialogues and consultations was held at an important moment when new changes have taken place in the international political and economic situation and China-US relations are facing new opportunities and new challenges. It is hoped that the two sides will be based on reality, focus on the long-term, communicate in depth, and move towards each other, injecting more positive energy into building a new relationship between China and the United States. , China has a proverb: ""As long as the skill is deep, the iron pestle will grind into a needle."" American poet Moore said: ""Victory will not come to me, I must go to victory myself."" Building a new relationship between China and the United States is a mission and responsibility. ""The tree of unity is born at the end; the nine-story platform starts from tired soil."" Let us use the spirit of building up mountains and mountains, step by step, work together to promote the construction of a new type of great power relationship, and strive to create a better tomorrow for Sino-US relations! , Thank you. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 9th), ""People's Daily"" (July 10, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Efforts to build a new Sino-US relationship,2851,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-07-10,"[, 克里国务卿，, 雅各布·卢财长，, 各位来宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　7月的北京，柳叶翠青，槐花馨香。在这个美好的季节里，第六轮中美战略与经济对话和第五轮中美人文交流高层磋商在北京开幕了，很高兴有机会同各位朋友见面。首先，我谨对远道而来的美国朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎！对长期以来关心和支持中美关系发展的两国各界人士，表示诚挚的感谢！, 　　我们今天所在的钓鱼台国宾馆，见证了中美关系一系列重大历史事件，基辛格秘密访华、尼克松对中国的历史性访问、中美建交谈判等都同这里有密切关系。1979年中美建立正式外交关系是当时轰动世界的大事件，不但改变了国际关系大格局，也开启了中美两国人民交流合作新时期。, 　　35年来，中美关系虽然历经风风雨雨，但总体是向前的，得到了历史性发展。两国建立了90多个政府间对话机制。双边贸易额增长了200多倍，去年达到5200多亿美元。双向投资存量已经超过1000亿美元。两国建立了41对友好省州和202对友好城市。两国人员往来每年超过400万人次。中美合作不仅造福中美两国人民，而且促进了亚太地区和世界和平、稳定、繁荣。, 　　早在1979年，邓小平先生就指出：两国人民的利益和世界和平的利益要求我们从国际形势的全局，用长远的战略观点来看待中美关系。今天，中美两国经济总量占世界三分之一、人口占世界四分之一、贸易总量占世界五分之一。而且，中美两国利益深度交融，历史和现实都表明，中美两国合则两利，斗则俱伤。中美合作可以办成有利于两国和世界的大事，中美对抗对两国和世界肯定是灾难。在这样的形势下，我们双方更应该登高望远，加强合作，坚持合作，避免对抗，既造福两国，又兼济天下。, 　　近1000年前，中国宋代文学家苏轼说过：“来而不可失者，时也；蹈而不可失者，机也。”发展中美关系要顺时应势、与时俱进。35年来，尽管国际环境和我们两国各自国情都发生了深刻变化，但中美关系能克服困难、不断前行，其原因就是两国几代领导人准确把握时代脉搏，不断赋予中美关系新的内涵和动力。今天，我们双方更应该审时度势，转变思路、创新思维，不断开创两国合作新局面。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　去年夏天，我同奥巴马总统在美国加州安纳伯格庄园举行了历史性会晤，达成共同努力构建中美新型大国关系的重要共识。此后，我同奥巴马总统在圣彼得堡和海牙会晤时，再次确认了这一共识。, 　　构建新型大国关系是双方在总结历史经验基础上，从两国国情和世界形势出发，共同作出的重大战略抉择，符合两国人民和各国人民根本利益，也体现了双方决心打破大国冲突对抗的传统规律、开创大国关系发展新模式的政治担当。, 　　一年来，中美新型大国关系建设取得了新的进展。两国继续携手应对国际金融危机影响，努力推动世界经济复苏。两国围绕有关国际和地区问题以及全球性问题开展密切协调，合力应对攸关人类前途命运的挑战。两国深化双边各领域务实交流合作，确保两国人民从中不断受益。, 　　构建中美新型大国关系是一项前无古人、后启来者的事业，没有现成经验和模式可以照搬，出现一些困难甚至波折不足为怪。有问题并不可怕，关键是我们要共同解决问题，而不能被问题牵着鼻子走。展望今后一个时期，我愿意谈几点看法和主张。, 　　第一，增进互信，把握方向。中美两国如何判断彼此战略意图，将直接影响双方采取什么样的政策、发展什么样的关系。不能在这个根本问题上犯错误，否则就会一错皆错。中国提出了“两个一百年”奋斗目标，正在努力实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，比以往任何时候都更需要一个和平稳定的外部环境。中国人民珍爱和平，崇尚“和为贵”，主张“己所不欲，勿施于人”。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，坚定奉行亲、诚、惠、容的周边外交理念，坚定致力于同本地区以及世界各国发展友好关系。, 　　“天高任鸟飞，海阔凭鱼跃。”我始终认为，宽广的太平洋有足够的空间容纳中美两个大国。中美双方应该加强对话，增信释疑，促进合作，确保中美关系始终不偏离构建新型大国关系的轨道。, 　　第二，相互尊重，聚同化异。中美两国历史文化传统、社会制度、意识形态不同，经济发展水平各异，双方存在不同看法、在一些问题上存在分歧和摩擦在所难免。中美是两个各具特色的国家，在很多方面肯定有差别，有差别才需要沟通和合作。我们双方应该坚持从大处着眼，把握构建新型大国关系总目标，认清两国共同利益远远大于分歧；应该相互尊重、平等相待，尊重彼此主权和领土完整，尊重彼此对发展道路的选择，不把自己的意志和模式强加于对方；应该善于管控矛盾和摩擦，坚持通过对话协商、以建设性方式增进理解、扩大共识。只要我们双方坚持相互尊重、聚同化异，保持战略耐心，不为一事所惑，不为一言所扰，中美关系大局就能任凭风浪起、稳坐钓鱼台。, 　　第三，平等互利，深化合作。新形势下，中美应该合作、能够合作的领域更加宽广。机会需要创造，创新才有机会，正所谓“聪者听于无声，明者见于未形”。中美都是富有创造力的民族，在推进两国关系发展上，尤其需要顺应时代发展而创新。我们双方应该创新思维，不断挖掘合作潜力、培育合作亮点。我们应该加快双边投资协定谈判，争取早日谈成一个高水平、双向平衡的协议，推进中美经济关系建设；应该深化两军对话，完善沟通和合作机制，推进中美军事关系建设；应该在双向和互利基础上加强对话合作，共同打击一切形式的恐怖主义；应该发挥各自优势、承担各自义务，共同应对气候变化这一全球性挑战；应该加强在重大国际和地区问题上的沟通和协调，为维护和促进世界和平、稳定、繁荣作出更大贡献。, 　　第四，着眼民众，加深友谊。中美两国人民对彼此都怀有淳朴友好的感情。中美友好的根基在民众，希望在青年。我曾多次访问美国，也去过普通美国人家中做客，美国民众的真诚好客让我深受感动。, 　　当今时代，经济全球化、社会信息化快速发展，但电话、网络永远不能取代人与人面对面的沟通和交流。植根于人心的友情，才是牢不可破的。我们要鼓励和扩大两国人民友好往来，拓宽两国地方、智库、媒体、青年、社会各界交流渠道，不断夯实中美友好的社会和民众基础。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　战略与经济对话和人文交流高层磋商是中美之间参与部门最多、讨论议题最广的重要平台。本轮对话和磋商是在国际政治经济形势出现新变化、中美关系面临新机遇新挑战的重要时刻举行的。希望双方立足现实、着眼长远、深入沟通、相向而行，为构建中美新型大国关系注入更多正能量。, 　　中国有句谚语：“只要功夫深，铁杵磨成针。”美国诗人摩尔说：“胜利不会向我走来，我必须自己走向胜利。”构建中美新型大国关系是一种使命和责任。“合抱之木，生于毫末；九层之台，起于累土。”让我们用积土成山的精神，一步一个脚印，携手推进新型大国关系建设，努力开创中美关系更加美好的明天！, 　　谢谢各位。, 　　（新华社北京7月9日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2014年07月10日 02 版）, ]",习近平：努力构建中美新型大国关系,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25261696
14,94,"[, On July 3, on a state visit to South Korea, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Feng Hao Zheng Yang Fan"" in the Korea Daily News, Central Daily News, and East Asia Daily. The article is as follows:, the wind is good and the sail is sailing, —— signed articles in Korea’s “Korea Daily”, “Central Daily”, and “East Asia Daily”, the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, there is a saying in South Korea: “Three copper plates buy houses, thousands Two golds buy neighbors."" The people of China and South Korea have been good neighbors since ancient times. With friendly feelings for good neighbors, I will soon pay a state visit to beautiful South Korea. This year is the 22nd anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea. Over the past 22 years, with the joint efforts of both sides, China-ROK cooperation in various fields has achieved tremendous achievements. China has become South Korea's largest trading partner, largest export market, largest source of imports, largest country for foreign investment, largest source of foreign students, and largest destination for overseas travel. The bilateral trade volume between China and South Korea exceeds the sum of the trade volume of South Korea, the United States, South Korea, Japan, South Korea and Europe, and the two countries become a veritable community of interests. There are more than 800 flights between China and South Korea every week, building an air bridge connecting the two peoples. Last year, there were 8.22 million person-to-person exchanges between China and South Korea. Within two years, we are expected to welcome 10 million person-to-person exchanges annually. The two sides have cooperated closely in international and regional affairs, and have made positive contributions to maintaining regional peace and stability, promoting the rejuvenation and development of Asia, and especially promoting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The rapid development of China-ROK relations, the wide scope of fields, and the profound influence have set an example for the development of national relations for the international community. , When President Park Geun-hye visited China last year, I presented her with a piece of Chinese calligraphy: ""I want to be a thousand miles away and go to the next level."" This is also my expectation for the development of China-ROK relations. At present, China-ROK relations are facing great opportunities for development. Injecting new impetus into the development of bilateral relations is a common issue facing both sides and the main task of my visit. Looking at the past, there are many good experiences in the development of China-ROK relations that are worth summarizing, inheriting, and developing. I think the most important thing is to do 4 persistence. , —— Adhere to good-neighborliness and friendship and enhance mutual trust. ""Faith"" has an important position in Oriental values. ""No faith is not standing"" is a philosophy that the people of China and South Korea abide by. The exchange of trust between China and South Korea has ensured a solid foundation for the long-term and healthy development of relations between the two countries. The two sides should strengthen high-level exchanges in various fields like visiting relatives, attach importance to each other's core interests and concerns, and exchange views on issues of common concern in a timely manner. , ——Insist on mutually beneficial cooperation and strengthen the integration of interests. Economic and trade relations have always been the highlight of China-ROK relations. China is willing to work with South Korea to accelerate the free trade zone negotiation process, deepen cooperation in the financial field, strengthen macro-policy coordination, and continue to make a big profit cake. ""One flower alone is not spring, all flowers bloom in the spring."" When the deep-seated impact of the international financial crisis has not been completely eliminated, China and South Korea should also work together and work together to lead the regional development and contribute to the prosperity and revitalization of Asia. , ——Insist on peace and stability and protect the common homeland. China and South Korea live side by side, deciding that China and South Korea not only share the development opportunities brought about by the peace and stability in the surrounding areas, but also jointly face the challenges of the complex security environment. In the event of turmoil, no country in the region can protect itself. Therefore, any action that detracts from the overall stability of the region should be opposed. I have exchanged views with President Park Geun-hye on this issue many times and believe that China and South Korea should take responsibility and jointly play a constructive role in achieving long-term stability in the region. , ——Insist on people-to-people exchanges and build a bridge of friendship. The cultures of China and South Korea have been integrated into each other's people's lives. The mutual recognition and understanding of the two peoples is an important foundation for the development of relations between the two countries. China will, as always, encourage and support non-governmental diplomatic and cultural exchanges between China and South Korea, forge good ties, tolerate and learn from each other, and write a new chapter of friendship between the people of China and South Korea. At present, China-Korea relations are standing at a new starting point. During the two-day visit, I will fully exchange views with President Park Geun-hye on issues of common concern, and have extensive contacts with friends from all walks of life in South Korea. I believe the two sides will reach a series of new consensuses to add momentum to the development of bilateral relations. At present, China is comprehensively deepening reform and expanding opening up, and the Chinese people are working hard to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. South Korea is also creating the ""Second Hanjiang Miracle."" For this, we all need a peaceful external environment. The people of China and South Korea are peace-loving, hard-working, and courageous people. I believe that China-South Korea cooperation will not only become an accelerator for the development of the two countries, but also a stabilizer for regional and even world peace. , The wind is sailing. I look forward to this visit becoming Syrian friendship, cooperation, development,Speed, and will become a stabilizer of regional and even world peace. , The wind is sailing. I look forward to this visit becoming a visit to Syrian friendship, cooperation on words, development and peacekeeping, which will allow China and South Korea friendly ships to sail forward and break the waves. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd), ""People's Daily"" (July 04, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes a signed article in the Korean media: The wind is good,1570,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-07-04,"[, 7月3日，在对韩国进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平在韩国《朝鲜日报》、《中央日报》、《东亚日报》同时发表题为《风好正扬帆》的署名文章。文章如下：, 风好正扬帆, ——在韩国《朝鲜日报》、《中央日报》、《东亚日报》的署名文章, 中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 韩国有句俗语：“三个铜板买房屋，千两黄金买邻居。”中韩两国人民自古就是好邻居。带着对善邻的友好感情，我即将对美丽的韩国进行国事访问。, 今年是中韩建交22周年。22年来，在双方共同努力下，中韩各领域合作取得巨大成就。中国已经成为韩国最大贸易伙伴、最大出口市场、最大进口来源国、最大海外投资对象国、最大留学生来源国、最大海外旅行目的地国。中韩双边贸易额超过了韩美、韩日、韩欧贸易额的总和，两国成为名副其实的利益共同体。每周往返于中韩之间的航班达800多个，架起连接两国人民的空中桥梁。去年，中韩人员往来达822万人次，不出两年，我们就有望迎来年度人员往来千万人次。双方在国际和地区事务中密切配合，为维护地区和平稳定、促进亚洲振兴发展，特别是为推进朝鲜半岛无核化进程作出了积极贡献。, 中韩关系发展速度之快、领域之广、影响之深，为国际社会树立了国家关系发展的典范。, 去年朴槿惠总统访华时，我赠送给她一幅中国书法：“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”。这也是我对中韩关系发展的期许。当前，中韩关系正面临大发展的机遇，给两国关系发展注入新动力是双方面临的共同课题，也是我这次访问的主要任务。, 观往知来，中韩关系发展有许多好经验值得总结、继承、发扬。我认为最重要的是做到4个坚持。, ——坚持睦邻友好，增强相互信任。“信”在东方价值观中具有重要地位，“无信不立”是中韩两国人民共同恪守的理念。中韩以信相交，确保了两国关系长期健康发展的牢固基础。双方应该像走亲戚一样加强高层和各领域交往，重视相互核心利益和关切，及时就共同关心的问题交换意见。, ——坚持互利合作，强化利益融合。经贸关系一直是中韩关系的亮点。中方愿意同韩方一道，加快自由贸易区谈判进程，深化金融领域合作，强化宏观政策协调，不断做大利益蛋糕。“一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园”。在国际金融危机深层次影响尚未完全消除的情况下，中韩还应该同舟共济、携手努力，共同引领地区发展，为亚洲繁荣和振兴作出贡献。, ——坚持和平稳定，守护共同家园。中韩两国毗邻而居，决定了中韩既共享周边和平稳定带来的发展机遇，又共同面对安全环境复杂的挑战。一旦发生动荡，域内国家没有谁能独善其身，因此，任何有损地区稳定大局的行为都应该受到反对。我同朴槿惠总统就这个问题多次交换意见，认为中韩两国应该担当责任，共同为实现本地区长治久安发挥建设性作用。, ——坚持人文交流，搭建友谊桥梁。中韩两国文化已经相互融入对方国家人民生活。两国人民相互认同和理解，是两国关系发展的重要基础。中国将一如既往鼓励和支持中韩民间外交和人文交流，广结善缘，包容互鉴，谱写中韩两国人民友好新篇章。, 当前，中韩关系正站在新的起点上。在两天的访问中，我将同朴槿惠总统就共同关心的问题充分交换意见，同韩国各界朋友广泛接触，相信双方将达成一系列新共识，为两国关系发展增添动力。, 当前，中国正在全面深化改革和扩大开放，中国人民正在为实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而努力奋斗。韩国也在创造“第二汉江奇迹”。为此，我们都需要和平外部环境。中韩两国人民都是热爱和平、吃苦耐劳、勇于进取的人民，相信中韩合作不仅会成为两国自身发展的加速器，而且会成为地区乃至世界和平的稳定器。, 风好正扬帆。我期待这次访问成为叙友好、话合作、谋发展、维和平的访问，让中韩友好航船高扬风帆、破浪前进。, （新华社北京7月3日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年07月04日 02 版）, ]",习近平在韩国媒体发表署名文章：风好正扬帆,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25236664
15,95,"[, On March 29, on the eve of a state visit to Belgium and the headquarters of the European Union, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""China-EU Friendship and Cooperation: Making Life Better"" in the Belgian Evening News. The article is as follows:, Sino-European Friendship and Cooperation: Making Life Better, ——A signed article in the Belgian “Evening News”, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, I have seen two stories: There is a Belgian from 2004 , Has been instructing local farmers to grow coffee beans out of poverty in the southwestern border of China. A Chinese came to Belgium in 1990 and used superb medical skills to help many patients get rid of the disease. There are many more stories like this, which made me feel the powerful force of China-EU friendship and cooperation. This kind of power came from the ancient Silk Road 2000 years ago, letting people with different skin colors, different languages ​​and different faiths on the Eurasian continent join hands to lead a better life together. This is the Chinese people and the peoples of Europe Common wish. It is with this desire that I paid a state visit to Belgium and the headquarters of the European Union. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Belgium in the past 43 years, the relations between the two countries have made great progress. Bilateral trade has increased more than 1,000 times since the beginning of diplomatic relations, and Belgium has become China's sixth largest trading partner in the EU. In recent years, mutual investment between the two countries has continued to grow. In the past five years, China’s direct investment in Belgium has increased nearly 10 times, creating a lot of local employment. The two sides successfully held a series of cultural exchange activities such as the ""Europa-China Art Festival"" and the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Belgium, and the friendship between the two peoples has been further deepened. Since the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe, the trade volume between China and Europe has quadrupled in 10 years, reaching US$559.1 billion in 2013. Now, there are more than 5.5 million person-to-person exchanges and more than 270,000 international students exchanged each other. Behind these figures is that the friendship and cooperation between China and Europe has brought richer commodities, more jobs and better learning opportunities to the people of both sides. , I look forward to deepening the mutually beneficial and win-win China-EU relations through this visit, so that China-EU friendship and cooperation will bring more well-being to the peoples of China and Europe. Today, both China and Europe are at a critical stage of their development. The Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a strategic plan to comprehensively deepen reform. Concrete implementation measures for more than 330 reform initiatives in 15 areas have been or are being introduced. The 1.3 billion Chinese people are making every effort to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Europe is also struggling on the road of reform and development. The EU has carried out drastic structural reforms, the people of European countries have made arduous efforts, and the spring of recovery has begun to disperse the cold winter of the European economy. The new situation gives China-EU friendship and cooperation new development opportunities. China and Europe are a community of interests on the road to development. China will continue to view Europe from a strategic perspective and support the construction of European integration. It is believed that the people of all European countries will also support the Chinese people to follow their own development path that suits China's national conditions. , In November last year, the two sides published the ""China-EU Cooperation 2020 Strategic Plan"". China is willing to work with Europe and do a blueprint to the end, with the implementation of the ""Planning"" as the main line, comprehensively strengthen exchanges and cooperation in trade, investment, finance, high technology, new energy, new urbanization and other fields, so that China-EU friendship and cooperation can develop for each Providing stronger assistance also brings more benefits to the people of both sides. The new situation gives China-EU friendship and cooperation a new strategic connotation. The population and total economic volume of China and Europe account for one-quarter and one-third of the world, respectively. With the vigorous development of economic globalization, world multi-polarization, and social informationization, the influence of China-EU relations has surpassed that of the Global strategic significance. -China and Europe are the two major forces that safeguard world peace. China is the country with the largest number of peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The EU is the world's largest foreign aid provider. The two sides have conducted effective cooperation on Iran's nuclear, Middle East, and anti-piracy issues. We must join hands to build a peaceful home for the earth with all peace-loving people around the world. -China and Europe are two major markets that promote common development. As the largest developing country, China's economic growth has contributed nearly 30% to world economic growth. As the largest economy, the EU's GDP reached 16.7 trillion US dollars. China and the EU should jointly uphold mutual benefit and win-win results, open up the market, commit themselves to the development of an open world economy, and provide a strong impetus for a strong, sustainable, and balanced growth of the global economy. -China and Europe are the two major civilizations that promote human progress. Both China and Europe are important birthplaces of Eastern and Western culturesGrowth provides strong motivation. -China and Europe are the two major civilizations that promote human progress. Both China and Europe are important birthplaces and outstanding representatives of Eastern and Western cultures. They have promoted each other for thousands of years. We must jointly uphold the diversity of civilizations, lead the world trend of mutual tolerance, mutual learning and mutual communication, and contribute to the common progress of human civilization. Under the new situation, Sino-European friendship and cooperation more need equal dialogue and exchanges. China and Europe have different national conditions and stages of development, and the people of China and Europe cannot agree on all issues. What we are in is not only an era of solidarity, but also an era of individuality, an era of unprecedented opportunities and an era of unprecedented challenges. , ""The wise seek common ground, the fool seeks difference."" China and the EU should strengthen dialogue and communication with mutual respect, treat each other as equals, seek common ground while reserving differences, and seek win-win cooperation. Dangerous beaches and reefs cannot stop the rivers that are rushing into the sea. I believe that problems and differences cannot stop the way forward of China-EU friendship and cooperation. , Belgium is the headquarters of the European Union and is called the ""heart of Europe"". The more powerful the ""heart"" pulsation, the more blood can be imported for China-EU cooperation. China-EU friendship and cooperation are the choice of the times and the choice of 1.8 billion people of China and Europe.

16,96,"[, On March 28, on a state visit to Germany, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Sino-Germany Working Together for the Benefit of China and Europe and the World"" in the ""Frankfurt Report"" in Germany. The article is as follows:, China and Germany work together to benefit China and Europe and the world, ——The signed article in the German “Frankfurt Report”, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, I am very happy to come to Germany again in the early spring of the recovery of everything. , 5 years ago, I visited Germany. At that time, Europe was under the haze of the international financial crisis, and the European debt problem was emerging, and the voice of declining Europe was very loud. China did not hesitate to choose to strengthen cooperation with Germany and Europe, overcome the difficulties together, and always maintain confidence in the euro, as always, firmly support European integration. Today, five years later, the European debt problem tends to ease, the euro is still strong, and new progress has been made in the European integration process. Germany, as the ""engine"" and ""stability anchor"" of the European economy, is leading Europe to accelerate the pace of recovery. This not only proves the correctness of our original judgment, but also confirms the depth of mutual trust and solid foundation of cooperation between the two countries. , Sino-German cooperation has a deep and solid foundation, this is because: ——Sino-German cooperation is an exchange and dialogue between the two civilizations. China and Germany are located on both ends of the Eurasian continent and are outstanding representatives of the two civilizations of the East and the West. The countless sages, profound philosophies, and rich literature and art of the two countries are inexhaustible sources of wisdom for mutual learning, mutual learning, exchange and cooperation. ——Sino-German cooperation is the mutual learning of two great nations. Although the historical traditions and development trajectories of China and Germany are different, the two ethnic groups share many common qualities, such as hard work, modesty, hard work, and innovation. This provides unique conditions for the two peoples to understand each other, respect each other, and learn from each other. ——Sino-German cooperation is the hand in hand of the two economic miracle creators. As the world's two largest trading nations and two major economies, China and Germany have already developed between you and me, and you and me. Regardless of the level of industrial development, market size, or the pattern of demand, Sino-German economic complementarity is very prominent, and the cooperation space is extremely broad. In recent years, Sino-German cooperation has been leading China-EU cooperation. Nearly one-third of the 1.5 billion US dollars of goods that travel between China and the EU each day belong to China and Germany. Every week, more than 70 flights connect more than 10 cities in both countries. Among the three intermodal trains that have been opened between China and Europe, two lead to Duisburg and Hamburg in Germany. More than 1 million tourists travel between China and Germany every year. Not only have the two countries become the largest trading partners of each other's countries in their respective regions, but they have also become the most important destinations for enterprises to invest in their businesses. To date, more than 8,200 German companies have settled in Hua'an, and more than 2,000 Chinese companies have established a foothold in Germany. More than 60 dialogues and cooperation mechanisms between the two governments, including government consultations, strategic dialogues, and dialogues between countries under the rule of law, operate smoothly, providing a strong guarantee for the continuous progress of Sino-German relations. The two countries are also increasingly communicating and cooperating on major international issues such as maintaining world peace, regional security, coping with climate change, food security, and promoting sustainable development. At present, a new round of global scientific and technological and industrial revolutions is just around the corner, and countries around the world are competing to adjust and adapt, and pay close attention to implementing the necessary reforms. China is determined to follow the trend of the times, comprehensively deepen reforms, and seize the historical opportunity to realize national modernization and national rejuvenation. In November last year, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made an overall plan for comprehensively deepening reforms, proposing a reform roadmap and timetable, involving 15 areas and more than 330 major reform initiatives. Among them, the focus is on deepening the reform of the economic system, building a unified and open market system with orderly competition, and letting the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government. We will deepen system reforms in all aspects and comprehensively promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities. , Germany launched the ""Industry 4.0"" strategy, actively promote energy transformation, and lead Europe to consolidate finances, implement structural reforms, vigorously implement the measures proposed in the ""Europe 2020"" strategy, and promote European integration. Sino-German cooperation will have more points of cooperation and gain new impetus. Sino-German relations will also enter a new stage of precise running-in and deep docking based on the existing high level. The foundation of China-Germany cooperation is to serve their respective domestic development and improve people's livelihood. The future of Sino-German cooperation still lies in whether it can bring tangible benefits to the two peoples. The combination of the Chinese market and German technology will undoubtedly greatly promote the economic and social development of China and Europe, and bring many benefits to the lives of ordinary people. The combination of Chinese speed and German quality will create tremendous room for growth in Central Europe and the world economySocial development has brought many benefits to the lives of ordinary people. The combination of Chinese speed and German quality will create tremendous room for growth in Central Europe and the world economy. As the most important economic entities in Asia and Europe, the strengthening of Sino-German economic integration will mean the strong growth of Asia and Europe. This will greatly promote the formation of a large Asia-Europe market, drive the growth of the entire Asia-Europe continent, and have a profound impact on the world economy and trade pattern. To strengthen cooperation between China and Germany, which adheres to the path of peaceful development, will be conducive to multi-polar development in the world and safeguard and promote world peace, stability and prosperity. , Friendship is based on respect, trust, and tolerance, as is national exchange. At present, what is lacking in comprehensively deepening Sino-German relations is not the fit of interests and common goals, but courage, open mind, and vision. , Let us understand and respect the basic system and development path chosen by the other people and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns. Let us go beyond simple trading relationships and give more strategic connotations to Sino-German cooperation with a more innovative and open mind. Let us properly handle differences through equal dialogue and friendly consultations, and plan a blueprint for the development of bilateral relations with a more macro and long-term perspective. Let us work together to improve and perfect international mechanisms and rules so that it can be more just and reasonable, better adapt to the development of the times and the common needs of the international community. Only in this way will the wheels of Sino-German cooperation turn faster and faster, and the better. , ""People's Daily"" (March 29, 2014, 02 edition),]","Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in Germany's ""Frankfurt Report""",1941,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-03-29,"[, 3月28日，在对德国进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平在德国《法兰克福汇报》发表题为《中德携手合作造福中欧和世界》的署名文章。文章如下：, 　　中德携手合作造福中欧和世界, 　　——在德国《法兰克福汇报》的署名文章, 　　中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 我很高兴在万物复苏的早春时节再次来到德国。, 5年前，我曾经访问德国。那时，欧洲正处于国际金融危机阴霾之下，欧债问题初露端倪，唱衰欧洲之声甚嚣尘上。中国毫不迟疑选择同德国和欧洲加强合作，共克时艰，始终对欧元保持信心，一如既往坚定支持欧洲一体化。, 5年后的今天，欧债问题趋于缓解，欧元依然坚挺，欧洲一体化进程取得了新进展。德国作为欧洲经济的“发动机”和“稳定锚”，正在引领欧洲加快复苏步伐。这些不仅证明了我们当初判断的正确性，更印证了两国互信之深和合作基础之牢。, 中德合作有着深厚而坚实的基础，这是因为：, ——中德合作是两大文明的交流对话。中国和德国分处亚欧大陆两端，是东西方两大文明杰出代表。两国数不尽的先贤哲人、深邃的思想哲理、丰富的文学艺术，是双方互学互鉴、交流合作取之不尽、用之不竭的智慧源泉。, ——中德合作是两个伟大民族的相互学习。尽管中德历史传统和发展轨迹不尽相同，但两个民族拥有很多共同的优良品质，比如勤恳耐劳、谦虚认真、踏实苦干、勇于创新。这为两国人民相互理解、相亲相敬、取长补短提供了得天独厚的条件。, ——中德合作是两个经济奇迹创造者的携手并进。作为全球两大贸易国和两大经济体，中德两国发展早已你中有我、我中有你，谁也离不开谁。无论从产业发展水平、市场规模，还是从需求格局看，中德经济互补性十分突出，合作空间极其广阔。, 近年来，中德合作一直领跑中欧合作。每天往返于中国和欧盟之间的15亿美元商品中，近1/3属于中德。每周，70多个航班连接着两国10多个城市。中欧之间已经开通的3条联运班列中，有2条通往德国的杜伊斯堡和汉堡。每年有超过100万游客来往于中德之间。两国不仅已经成为对方国家在各自地区的最大贸易伙伴，更成为企业投资兴业的最重要目的地。迄今有8200多家德国企业在华安家落户，超过2000家中国企业在德国站稳脚跟。政府磋商、战略对话、法治国家对话等两国政府的60多个对话、合作机制运行顺畅，为中德关系不断取得新进展提供了有力保障。在维护世界和平、地区安全，应对气候变化、粮食安全，推动可持续发展等重大国际问题上，两国也日益紧密地开展沟通和合作。, 当前，全球新一轮科技和产业革命呼之欲出，世界各国争相调整、适应，抓紧实施必要改革。中国决心顺应时代潮流，全面深化改革，抓住实现国家现代化、实现民族复兴的历史机遇。, 去年11月，中共十八届三中全会就全面深化改革作出总体部署，提出了改革路线图和时间表，涉及15个领域、330多项较大的改革举措。其中，重点是深化经济体制改革，建设统一开放、竞争有序的市场体系，让市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用。我们将深化各方面体制改革，全面推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化。, 德国推出了“工业4.0”战略，积极推行能源转型，并引领欧洲整固财政，实施结构改革，大力落实“欧洲2020”战略提出的举措，推进欧洲一体化。中德合作将会有更多契合点，获得新动力。中德关系也将在现有高水平基础上，进入一个精确磨合和深度对接的新阶段。, 中德合作的根本在于服务各自国内发展和改善民生。中德合作的未来仍然在于能否为两国人民带来实实在在好处。中国市场和德国技术的结合，无疑将极大促进中欧经济社会发展，给普通百姓生活带来诸多实惠。中国速度和德国质量的联手，将为中欧乃至世界经济创造巨大增长空间。, 作为亚洲和欧洲最主要的经济实体，中德经济加强融合，将意味着亚欧两大增长极的强强联手。这将极大促进亚欧大市场的形成，带动整个亚欧大陆的增长，并对世界经济和贸易格局产生深远影响。, 坚持走和平发展道路的中国同德国加强合作，将有利于世界多极化发展，维护和促进世界和平、稳定、繁荣。, 友谊建立在尊重、信任、包容基础上，国家交往亦是如此。当前，全面深化中德关系，缺的不是利益契合和共同目标，而是勇气、胸襟、视野。, 让我们理解和尊重对方人民选择的基本制度和发展道路，照顾彼此核心利益和重大关切。让我们超越简单的买卖关系，以更加创新和开放的思维，赋予中德合作更多战略内涵。让我们通过平等对话和友好协商妥善处理分歧，以更加宏观和长远的眼光为两国关系发展谋划蓝图。让我们共同致力于国际机制和规则的改进和完善，使其更加公正合理、更好适应时代发展和国际社会共同需求。, 只有这样，中德合作的车轮才会越转越快、越转越好。, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年03月29日 02 版）, ]",习近平在德国《法兰克福汇报》发表署名文章 ,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24770827
17,97,"[, On March 25th, on a state visit to France, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Special Friends and Win-win Partners"" in the French newspaper Le Figaro. The article is as follows:, special friends, win-win partners-signed article in the French newspaper ""Le Figaro"", President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping, from today, I will pay a three-day state visit to France. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. I chose this opportunity to visit France in order to summarize the past, pass on friendship, and build on the past, and push China-France relations to a higher level. 50 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong and General Charles de Gaulle, with their excellent strategic vision and extraordinary political courage, pushed the two great countries of China and France to achieve a handshake, and set an example of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation for countries with different social systems for the international community. The significant and far-reaching impact of the international strategic pattern continues to this day. -In the past 50 years, the leaders of the two countries have adhered to a global perspective, uphold the spirit of independence and autonomy, and prioritize the development of Sino-French relations in their respective foreign relations. France is the first Western power to establish ambassadorial diplomatic relations with New China and the first Western power to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership and institutional strategic dialogue with China. -Over the past 50 years, the two countries have carried out a number of pioneering cooperations to continuously enrich the strategic connotation of Sino-French relations. France is the first Western country to develop civil nuclear energy cooperation with China, the first Western country to sign an intergovernmental scientific and technological cooperation agreement with China, and the first Western country to open direct flights with China. Now, there are nearly 60 flights between the two countries every week. ——In the past 50 years, the humanities exchanges between the two countries have been uninterrupted, which has promoted the exchanges and mutual learning between the two splendid civilizations of China and France, and has brought the hearts and minds of the two peoples closer. France is the first country to host a cultural year with China and establish a cultural center with each other, and it is also the first major Western country to conduct youth exchanges with China. There are 100,000 young people in China learning French. There are also more and more people learning Chinese in France, and there are currently 45,000. This number is still growing. , Confucius said: ""Fifty knows the destiny."" The 50-year history of Sino-French relations has accumulated many beneficial experiences and enlightenment for both sides to maintain a special friendship and take a win-win path. Both sides believe that mutual respect, mutual trust and honesty are necessary prerequisites for the healthy and stable development of China-France relations. Dare to take the lead and advance with the times is an important magic weapon for China-France relations to always be at the forefront of China-Western relations. Mutual benefit and mutual benefit are the fundamental starting points for Sino-French relations to benefit the people of the two countries in the long term. Independence, seeking common ground while reserving differences are the spiritual basis for China and France to achieve coordination and cooperation in international affairs. Working together in the same boat and facing the world is China and France's unremitting pursuit of the cause of peace and development of mankind. The Chinese speak of ""integration of knowledge and action"", and the French speak of ""making iron to become a blacksmith"", all emphasizing the need to transform ideas into actions. During the three-day visit, I will fully exchange views with French leaders such as President Hollande, and will jointly issue a new joint statement and a medium- and long-term cooperation plan. I believe that we will be able to reach a new important consensus. I believe that as a comprehensive strategic partner, China and France must respect and trust each other, cooperate and innovate, and continue to lead the development of China-EU relations and China-Western relations. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, both China and France shoulder the historical mission of maintaining world peace and promoting common development. In order to promote world multi-polarization and democratization of international relations, promote the integration of international hotspot issues into a peaceful solution, and work together to tackle global challenges such as terrorism and climate change, both parties have the ability and wisdom to propose good initiatives and programs. As the two major economies in the world, China and France have many points of interest and strong complementarities. The two sides should fully unleash the potential for cooperation, through joint R&D, joint investment, and joint development of third-country markets, etc., to deepen the integration of interests in traditional cooperation fields such as nuclear energy, aviation, aerospace, and automobile between the two countries, and create new areas such as agriculture, food, finance, and digital New highlights of cooperation. Both China and France advocate an inclusive approach. Both sides will actively explore new ways to improve the level of cultural exchanges between the two countries and deepen mutual understanding between the two peoples. The two sides will continue to hold activities that the people like to hear about to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, expand the exchange of international students and tourists, and take new measures to facilitate personnel exchanges. At present, China has entered a new stage of comprehensive deepening of reform and expansion of opening up. It is working to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by advancing new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization. Chinese dream. France is also actively promoting structural reformsNow we are striving for the goal of ""two hundred years"" to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. France is also actively promoting structural reforms and is committed to maintaining growth, improving competitiveness, expanding employment, and realizing the new French dream. Both China and France are nations with a spirit of reform. As long as both sides seize the opportunity and support each other, the road of cooperation will surely become wider and wider, and the relationship between China and France will surely move towards a glorious 50 years. Before I came to France, I have visited the Netherlands, and I will also visit the headquarters of Germany, Belgium and the European Union. I took 11 days to visit Europe on the occasion of the Spring Festival this year because I attach great importance to EU and China-EU relations and firmly support the construction of European integration. At present, both China and Europe are at a critical stage of their development, and China-EU relations are facing new opportunities for development. Both sides should continue to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of finance, infrastructure construction, new urbanization, new energy, technological innovation, energy conservation and environmental protection, and accelerate the pace of negotiation of the China-EU Investment Agreement. At the same time, we must respect each other's development path, insist on properly handling trade disputes through equal dialogue and friendly consultation, and realize the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations. This will not only benefit the people of China and Europe, but also promote world peace and prosperity, and exert an important influence that transcends China and Europe and has greater global significance. , Friends are getting closer and closer, good words are getting closer and closer. I look forward to in-depth exchanges with the French government and friends from all walks of life, seeking a win-win situation.

18,98,"[, Dear Prime Minister Rutte, Dear Colleagues,: Today, it is of great significance for us to gather in The Hague to discuss countermeasures to strengthen nuclear safety. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Rutte and the Dutch government for their active efforts and thoughtful arrangements for this summit! In the last century, the discovery of atoms and the development and utilization of nuclear energy have brought new impetus to human development and greatly enhanced our ability to understand and transform the world. At the same time, the development of nuclear energy is also accompanied by nuclear safety risks and challenges. For human beings to make better use of nuclear energy and achieve greater development, they must deal with various nuclear safety challenges and maintain the safety of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. , Colleagues! , Strengthening nuclear safety is an ongoing process. The development of the nuclear energy industry has not stopped, and efforts to strengthen nuclear safety cannot be stopped. From Washington in 2010, to Seoul in 2012, and to The Hague today, the Nuclear Security Summit carries the important mission of consolidating the consensus of all countries and deepening nuclear security efforts. We must adhere to a rational, coordinated, and progressive nuclear safety concept and put the nuclear safety process on the track of healthy and sustainable development. First, we must attach equal importance to development and safety, and develop nuclear energy under the premise of ensuring safety. As an important way to ensure energy security and respond to climate change, the cause of peaceful use of nuclear energy, like the fire that Prometheus brought to the world, ignited the fire of hope for human development and expanded the bright prospects. At the same time, if the safety of nuclear energy cannot be effectively guaranteed and the potential safety risks of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities cannot be properly dealt with, this bright prospect will be overshadowed and even brought disaster. If the fire of hope for the development of the nuclear energy industry will never go out, we must firmly adhere to the principle of safety first. , We must uphold the concept of seeking safety for development and promoting development with safety, so that the two goals of development and safety can be organically integrated, so that governments and nuclear energy companies of all countries can realize that any nuclear energy development at the expense of safety is difficult to sustain. Real development. Only by taking practical measures can we truly manage and control risks; and only by achieving safety guarantees can nuclear energy continue to develop. Second, equal rights and obligations, and promote the international nuclear safety process based on respect for the rights and interests of all countries. No rules, no standards. All countries should earnestly fulfill their obligations under international legal instruments on nuclear safety, fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions, consolidate and develop the existing nuclear safety legal framework, and provide institutional guarantees and universally followed guiding principles for international nuclear safety efforts. China calls on more countries to actively consider ratifying the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendments and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Different countries have different national conditions, the nuclear energy industry is at different stages of development, and nuclear security challenges are also different. A key opens a lock. While emphasizing the fulfillment of relevant international obligations by all countries, it is also necessary to respect the right of each country to adopt its own nuclear safety policies and measures in accordance with its national conditions, respect the rights of all countries to protect nuclear safety sensitive information, adhere to the principle of fairness, in a pragmatic spirit, and actively Steady advancement of the international nuclear safety process. Thirdly, both autonomy and collaboration are equally important, and universal nuclear safety is sought through mutual benefit and win-win results. Nuclear safety is first and foremost a national issue, and the primary responsibility should be borne by governments of various countries. Governments of various countries should be aware of their responsibilities and responsibilities, strengthen their nuclear safety awareness, cultivate a nuclear safety culture, strengthen mechanism building, and upgrade their technical level. This is both responsible for yourself and the world. , Nuclear safety is also a global issue. The water holding capacity of a wooden barrel is determined by the shortest board. If a country's nuclear material is lost, the world will face threats. Achieving universal nuclear safety requires the joint efforts of all countries. We want to attract more countries to join the international nuclear security process, so that all countries can benefit from it and contribute to it, and strive to globalize the nuclear security process. We need to strengthen exchanges and learn from each other. The relevant multilateral mechanisms and initiatives must coordinate, coordinate and work together so that even if they do not start on the same starting line, one partner will not be left behind. Fourthly, we should treat both the symptoms and the root cause, with the goal of eliminating root causes, and comprehensively promote nuclear safety efforts. Nuclear safety involves different levels, including the implementation of scientific and effective management, the development of advanced safe nuclear energy technology, and the proper response to nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. Improving nuclear security policy measures, developing modern and low-risk nuclear energy technologies, adhering to the balance between supply and demand of nuclear materials, strengthening non-proliferation export control, and deepening international cooperation in combating nuclear terrorism are direct and effective ways to eliminate hidden nuclear safety hazards and nuclear proliferation risks . , The symptoms must be cured. Only by creating a peaceful and stable international environment, developing harmonious and friendly national relations, and carrying out peaceful and open civilization exchanges can we resolve the root causes of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation and achieve lasting security and development of nuclear energy. , Colleagues! , China has always putOnly through exchange can we solve the problems of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation from the root causes, and achieve the lasting security and development of nuclear energy. , Colleagues! , China has always placed nuclear safety at the top of the cause of peaceful use of nuclear energy, and manages nuclear materials and facilities in accordance with the strictest standards. For more than 50 years of developing nuclear energy, China has maintained a good nuclear safety record. , Dutch philosopher Erasmus said that prevention is better than cure. In recent years, major international nuclear accidents have sounded the alarm for all countries. We must do everything possible to prevent the recurrence of historical tragedies. In order to prevent problems before they happen, China has taken comprehensive measures to ensure nuclear safety. We have made great efforts to improve the level of nuclear safety technology and nuclear safety emergency response capabilities, and conducted comprehensive safety inspections of nuclear facilities nationwide to ensure that all nuclear materials and facilities are effectively safeguarded. We have formulated and implemented a medium- and long-term nuclear safety plan, improved the national nuclear safety regulations, and are formulating national nuclear safety regulations to solidly advance the institutionalization and legalization of nuclear safety work. , China actively promotes international cooperation in nuclear safety. The nuclear safety demonstration center jointly constructed by China and the United States held a groundbreaking ceremony, and the construction of the project went smoothly. This center will contribute to regional and international nuclear safety technology exchange and cooperation. China has launched a series of cooperation projects with Russia and Kazakhstan in the field of combating the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. China supports the reduction of the use of high-enriched uranium as far as economically and technologically feasible, and is helping Ghana convert a research reactor using high-enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium fuel within the framework of the IAEA. China has donated to the IAEA Nuclear Safety Fund to enhance the nuclear safety capabilities of countries in the Asia-Pacific region through training courses and other means. , Colleagues! , The light moves forward one point, and the darkness moves back one point. If we make more efforts in the field of nuclear security, terrorism will have one less opportunity. To achieve lasting nuclear security, China is willing to continue to make its own efforts and contributions. First, China will unswervingly enhance its nuclear safety capabilities, continue to work to strengthen nuclear safety government regulatory capacity building, increase nuclear safety technology research and development and human resources investment, and insist on cultivating and developing a nuclear safety culture. Second, China will unswervingly participate in the construction of an international nuclear safety system, work with other countries to promote the establishment of a fair, cooperative, and win-win international nuclear safety system, and promote the sharing of achievements in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Third, China will unswervingly support international cooperation in nuclear safety, and is willing to share technology and experience, contribute resources and platforms, and promote regional and international nuclear safety cooperation. China supports the IAEA’s leading role and encourages it to help developing countries improve their nuclear safety capabilities. China will continue to actively participate in nuclear safety activities and invite the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out physical protection consulting services. Fourth, China will unswervingly maintain regional and world peace and stability, adhere to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, properly handle conflicts and disputes through equal dialogue and friendly consultations, and work with other countries to eliminate the existence of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation source. , Colleagues! , Strengthening nuclear safety is both our common commitment and our common responsibility. Let us work together so that people of all countries have more confidence in achieving lasting nuclear security and more confidence in the cause of nuclear energy for the benefit of mankind! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, March 24), ""People's Daily"" (March 25, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the Hague Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands,2548,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-03-25,"[, 尊敬的吕特首相，, 各位同事：, 今天，我们共聚海牙，探讨加强核安全对策，意义十分重大。首先，我谨对吕特首相和荷兰政府为本次峰会所作的积极努力和周到安排，表示衷心的感谢！, 上个世纪，原子的发现和核能的开发利用给人类发展带来了新的动力，极大增强了我们认识世界和改造世界的能力。同时，核能发展也伴生着核安全风险和挑战。人类要更好利用核能、实现更大发展，就必须应对好各种核安全挑战，维护好核材料和核设施安全。, 各位同事！, 加强核安全是一个持续进程。核能事业发展不停步，加强核安全的努力就不能停止。从2010年的华盛顿，到2012年的首尔，再到今天的海牙，核安全峰会承载着凝聚各国共识、深化核安全努力的重要使命。我们要坚持理性、协调、并进的核安全观，把核安全进程纳入健康持续发展的轨道。, 第一，发展和安全并重，以确保安全为前提发展核能事业。作为保障能源安全和应对气候变化的重要途径，和平利用核能事业，如同普罗米修斯带到人间的火种，为人类发展点燃了希望之火，拓展了美好前景。同时，如果不能有效保障核能安全，不能妥善应对核材料和核设施的潜在安全风险，就会给这一美好前景蒙上阴影，甚至带来灾难。要使核能事业发展的希望之火永不熄灭，就必须牢牢坚持安全第一原则。, 我们要秉持为发展求安全、以安全促发展的理念，让发展和安全两个目标有机融合，使各国政府和核能企业认识到，任何以牺牲安全为代价的核能发展都难以持续，都不是真正的发展。只有采取切实举措，才能真正管控风险；只有实现安全保障，核能才能持续发展。, 第二，权利和义务并重，以尊重各国权益为基础推进国际核安全进程。没有规矩，不成方圆。各国要切实履行核安全国际法律文书规定的义务，全面执行联合国安理会有关决议，巩固和发展现有核安全法律框架，为国际核安全努力提供制度保障和普遍遵循的指导原则。中国呼吁更多国家积极考虑批准核材料实物保护公约及其修订案、制止核恐怖主义行为国际公约。, 各国国情不同，核能事业处于不同发展阶段，面临的核安全挑战也不尽相同。一把钥匙开一把锁。在强调各国履行有关国际义务的同时，也要尊重各国根据本国国情采取最适合自己的核安全政策和举措的权利，尊重各国保护核安全敏感信息的权利，坚持公平原则，本着务实精神，积极稳妥推进国际核安全进程。, 第三，自主和协作并重，以互利共赢为途径寻求普遍核安全。核安全首先是国家课题，首要责任应该由各国政府承担。各国政府要知责任、负责任，强化核安全意识，培育核安全文化，加强机制建设，提升技术水平。这既是对自己负责，也是对世界负责。, 核安全也是全球性课题。一个木桶的盛水量，是由最短的那块板决定的。一国核材料丢失，全世界都将面临威胁。实现普遍核安全，需要各国携手努力。我们要吸引更多国家加入国际核安全进程，使各国既从中受益，也为之作出贡献，争取实现核安全进程全球化。我们要加强交流、互鉴共享，有关多边机制和倡议要统筹协调、协同努力，争取做到即使不在同一起跑线上起跑，也不让一个伙伴掉队。, 第四，治标和治本并重，以消除根源为目标全面推进核安全努力。核安全涉及不同层面，既包括实施科学有效管理，发展先进安全核能技术，也包括妥善应对核恐怖主义和核扩散。完善核安全政策举措，发展现代化和低风险的核能技术，坚持核材料供需平衡，加强防扩散出口控制，深化打击核恐怖主义的国际合作，是消除核安全隐患和核扩散风险的直接和有效途径。, 治标还要治本。只有营造和平稳定的国际环境，发展和谐友善的国家关系，开展和睦开放的文明交流，才能从根源上解决核恐怖主义和核扩散问题，实现核能的持久安全和发展。, 各位同事！, 中国一向把核安全工作放在和平利用核能事业的首要位置，按照最严格标准对核材料和核设施实施管理。发展核能事业50多年来，中国保持了良好的核安全记录。, 荷兰哲人伊拉斯谟说过，预防胜于治疗。近几年，国际上发生的重大核事故为各国敲响了警钟，我们必须尽一切可能防止历史悲剧重演。, 为防患于未然，中国全面采取了核安全保障举措。我们着力提高核安全技术水平，提高核安全应急能力，对全国核设施开展了全面安全检查，确保所有核材料和核设施得到有效安全保障。我们制定和实施了核安全中长期规划，完善国家核安全法规体系，正在制定国家核安全条例，扎实推进核安全工作机制化、法制化。, 中国积极推动核安全国际合作。中国同美国合建的核安全示范中心举行了奠基仪式，工程建设进展顺利。这个中心将为地区乃至国际核安全技术交流合作作出贡献。中国在打击核材料非法贩运领域同俄罗斯和哈萨克斯坦等国开展一系列合作项目。中国支持在经济和技术可行的情况下，尽可能减少高浓铀使用，正在国际原子能机构框架内帮助加纳把一个使用高浓铀的研究堆改造为使用低浓铀燃料。中国向国际原子能机构核安全基金捐款，通过举办培训班等方式，提升亚太地区国家核安全能力。, 各位同事！, 光明前进一分，黑暗便后退一分。我们在核安全领域多作一份努力，恐怖主义就少一次可乘之机。为实现持久核安全，中国愿意继续作出自己的努力和贡献。, 第一，中国将坚定不移增强自身核安全能力，继续致力于加强核安全政府监管能力建设，加大核安全技术研发和人力资源投入力度，坚持培育和发展核安全文化。, 第二，中国将坚定不移参与构建国际核安全体系，同各国一道推动建立公平、合作、共赢的国际核安全体系，促进各国共享和平利用核能事业的成果。, 第三，中国将坚定不移支持核安全国际合作，愿意为此分享技术和经验，贡献资源和平台，促进地区和国际核安全合作。中国支持国际原子能机构发挥主导作用，鼓励其帮助发展中国家提高核安全能力。中国将继续积极参与核安全活动，邀请国际原子能机构开展实物保护咨询服务。, 第四，中国将坚定不移维护地区和世界和平稳定，坚持和平发展、合作共赢，通过平等对话和友好协商妥善处理矛盾和争端，同各国一道致力于消除核恐怖主义和核扩散存在的根源。, 各位同事！, 加强核安全，既是我们的共同承诺，也是我们的共同责任。让我们携手合作，使各国人民对实现持久核安全更有信心、对核能事业造福人类更有信心！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社海牙3月24日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年03月25日 02 版）, ]",习近平在荷兰海牙核安全峰会上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24725050
19,99,"[, On March 23, on a state visit to the Netherlands and attending the third Nuclear Security Summit, President Xi Jinping published a signature entitled ""Opening the Door to Europe and Working Together for Prosperity"" in the ""New Rotterdam Business News"" in the Netherlands article. The article is as follows:, Open the door to Europe and work together to create prosperity, ——A signed article in the “New Rotterdam Business News” in the Netherlands, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, I flew to the Netherlands on March 22nd to expand my post as Chairman of the People’s Republic of China The first official visit to Europe since. This visit covers European and American countries, European Union headquarters, and United Nations specialized agencies. , Europe is an important pole in a multi-polar world and a comprehensive strategic partner of China. China has always viewed China-EU relations from a strategic perspective, and regards Europe as the main direction of China's diplomacy. My current trip to Europe is to increase mutual trust, deepen cooperation, build on the past, build on the past, and improve the level of China-EU relations with European partners. The Netherlands is an important gateway to Europe and the first stop of my visit. On behalf of the Chinese people, I extend my sincere regards and best wishes to all European people. , —— My current visit to Europe is for peace. There is an old saying in China: ""The weather is not as good as the geography, and the geography is not as good as the people."" The current world needs development, and development needs peace. Like the people of other countries, the Chinese people must not only strive for a peaceful international environment to develop themselves, but also maintain and promote world peace through their own development. , The Hague Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands shoulders the historical mission of planning the future blueprint for the nuclear security process. Ensuring the safety of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities and effectively responding to the threat of nuclear terrorism are not only related to the national security and social stability of all countries, but also to the sustainable development of mankind. I look forward to sharing the experience and experience with the leaders of various countries and relevant international organizations at this summit, in-depth discussion on promoting international nuclear safety, making reasonable plans for the future nuclear safety process, and making positive contributions to human peace. , —— My current visit to Europe is to promote cooperation. China-EU economic and trade relations are one of the largest and most dynamic economic and trade relations in the world. The EU is China's largest trading partner, and China is the EU's second largest trading partner. Both sides are the two most important markets for each other, with huge cooperation potential and broad cooperation prospects. As the largest developing country and the largest consortium of developed countries, China-EU cooperation goes far beyond the bilateral scope and has global significance. Strengthening cooperation between the two sides is not only beneficial to their respective developments, but also to world peace, stability and prosperity. During the visit, I will exchange in-depth views with leaders of relevant countries and EU institutions on deepening China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership in the new situation, expanding pragmatic cooperation, identifying the points of mutual development strategic planning, promoting the in-depth development of China-EU cooperation, and jointly promoting the world The economy is strong, sustainable and balanced. , —— My current visit to Europe is for exchange and mutual learning. China is comprehensively deepening reforms, promoting sustained and healthy economic and social development, and continuously improving the living standards and quality of the people. The EU has also accumulated a lot of experience in dealing with sovereign debt and promoting European integration. We are willing to exchange and learn from each other with the European side, whether there is mutual exchange, and promote the success of their respective reforms and development. We also hope to communicate and coordinate closely with the European side and work together to build a rule-based, more transparent, fair, reasonable and effective international governance system. ------My current visit to Europe is to promote the progress of civilization. Humane exchanges are positive elements for promoting peaceful development and an important driving force for economic development. As representatives of the two great civilizations of the East and the West, China and Europe have made indelible contributions to the progress of mankind. The total population and the total economic volume of China and Europe account for one quarter and one third of the world, respectively. Expanding cultural exchanges is essential for enhancing mutual understanding and promoting social prosperity. I will exchange views with European leaders on deepening Sino-European cultural cooperation and facilitating personnel exchanges between the two sides, and strive to increase the friendship between the two peoples, promote the mutual understanding between the two major civilizations, and promote the progress and prosperity of human civilization. , The Netherlands is an important partner of China in Europe. China and the Netherlands have direct railways, freighters, and commercial flights, which form a unique advantage of comprehensive connectivity. China-Netherlands cooperation has a wide scope, large scale, and strong endogenous power. It is known for its pragmatic and efficient cooperation, which is the epitome and model of China-EU cooperation. The Netherlands has maintained China's second largest trading partner status in the EU for 11 consecutive years and is the EU's third largest source of direct investment in China. China is the Netherlands' largest trading partner and second largest source of investment outside the EU. The cooperation between the two sides in the fields of agriculture, water conservancy, petrochemicals and logistics is at the forefront of China-EU cooperation. The Netherlands is one of the most open European countries for cooperation with China. Both sides support trade liberalization and are committed to building an open, transparent, fair and orderly market and competitive environment. , This timeOne of the open European countries, both sides support trade liberalization and are committed to building an open, transparent, fair and orderly market and competitive environment. , This visit is the first visit by the Chinese head of state to the Netherlands, marking a new stage of development in relations between the two countries. During the visit, I discussed the cooperation plan with the leaders of the Netherlands, and extensively contacted people from all walks of life to jointly plan the future development of bilateral relations, enrich the connotation of bilateral pragmatic cooperation, and promote the relationship between the two countries to a new level, and unanimously decided to establish openness Pragmatic and comprehensive partnership. The two sides issued a joint statement and signed multiple cooperation documents in the fields of energy, agriculture, finance, investment, and culture. At present, China is moving towards the goal of ""two hundred years"", and the EU is also stepping up its ""Europe 2020"" strategy. Making the country more prosperous and powerful, making society more fair and just, and making people's lives better. This is the ideal that the Chinese people are tirelessly pursuing, and it is also the common wish of the European people. We are willing to work with European countries to deepen mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, share opportunities, and create prosperity. From winter to spring, Vientiane renews, and the pace of time never stops. Beijing and Amsterdam are nearly 8,000 kilometers apart, but no matter how far away, they cannot stop the pace of China and Europe approaching each other and expanding cooperation, nor can they stop the enthusiasm of the people on both sides to attract each other and enhance friendship. , I look forward to my trip to Europe. I firmly believe that 2014 will surely open a new era of China-EU relations full of vitality.

20,118,"[, 　　On November 8, the Dialogue on Strengthening Interconnection Partnership was held in Beijing Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. President Xi Jinping chaired the meeting and delivered an important speech entitled ""China Unicom leads development partners to focus on cooperation"". Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Tao, esteemed President Hamid, esteemed President Jumari, esteemed President Eleberg Durgi, esteemed President Wu Dengsheng, esteemed President Rahmon, esteemed Hun Sen Prime Minister, Dear Prime Minister Sharif, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Friends: First of all, everyone came to Beijing to attend the ""Strengthening Interconnection Partnership"" Host Partners Dialogue, which is the vividness of our deep friendship and friendly cooperative relations This is also an important support for everyone to host the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you! , 　　 ""Friends are getting closer and closer, and neighbors are getting closer and closer."" It is necessary to exchange face-to-face opinions between neighboring countries on major issues. As the host of the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting, China has made Asia-Pacific interconnection one of its topics. Considering that interconnection is a major event, Asian countries and relevant international organizations are very concerned and have the desire to participate. We decided to convene this meeting after consulting with all parties to discuss the major development plans for Asia. , 　　 There is a fable in China called ""Yugong Yishan"". About thousands of years ago, an old man named Yugong in a mountain village with inconvenient traffic made up his mind to remove the two big mountains that were in front of his house. Relatives and neighbors said that it was impossible, but he vigorously dissented from the public and took his children and grandchildren to dig the earth day after day. He said that the mountain will not increase or increase, but the people are endless, as long as perseverance, one day will move the mountain away. Yugong's spirit moved the gods, the two mountains were moved away with the joint efforts of man and god, and Yugong's hometown was interconnected with the outside world. , 　　 Since ancient times, interconnection has been the pursuit of human society. Our ancestors have created many interconnected miracles under extremely difficult conditions. The Silk Road is a model. The people of Asian countries can be called pioneers of interconnection. , 　　 human beings are developing, society is progressing. At present, the impact of the international financial crisis is still there, and the growth of the world economy and international trade has slowed down. At the same time, a new round of industrial revolution and technological revolution is gaining momentum, regional free trade arrangements are emerging in an endless stream, and structural adjustment, reform and innovation have become world trends. Asian countries must actively take actions to develop Asian value, Asian creation, Asian investment, and Asian markets on the basis of Asian resources, Asian manufacturing, Asian savings, and Asian factories, and jointly cultivate new economic growth points and competitive advantages. To achieve these goals, interconnection is one of the key links. , 　　 Today, the interconnection we want to build is not only road construction and bridge building, not only flat and single-line connectivity, but also the trinity of infrastructure, regulations, and personnel exchanges. It should be policy communication, facility connectivity, and trade. The five major areas of unimpeded access, capital and financial connectivity, and people-to-people connectivity go hand in hand. This is a omnidirectional, three-dimensional, network-like big Unicom, and is an open system full of vitality and brainstorming. , 　　 Asia's interconnection construction faces both opportunities and difficulties. The systems and laws of various countries are quite different, the needs of all parties are very different, the coordination of various mechanisms is not satisfactory, and so on. The funding problem is the most prominent. According to estimates by the Asian Development Bank, the annual infrastructure investment needs of the Asian region will reach US$730 billion before 2020. Solving these problems cannot be achieved only by the efforts of one or a few countries. Only by extensively establishing partnerships, thinking together, and working towards one place can we continue to achieve positive results. , 　　——We want to realize the joint development of Asian countries. Asian countries attach great importance to connectivity, and many countries have their own infrastructure construction plans. Now, it is necessary to connect with the strategies and plans of various countries, identify priority areas and projects, concentrate resources, and promote jointly. This is conducive to reducing logistics costs, creating demand and employment, giving play to comparative advantages and latecomer advantages, occupying a favorable position in the global supply chain, industrial chain, and value chain, improving comprehensive competitiveness, and creating a strong, sustainable, and balanced growth in Asia Develop new weather. Asian countries are like bright lights. Only by connecting them in series and in parallel can the lights of Asia's night sky be brilliant. , 　　——We want to shape a more open Asian economic structure. Faced with the trend of the times of world multi-polarization, economic globalization, cultural diversity, and social informationization, no country can close the door to engage in construction. There is no way out for closure, and development can only be achieved when open. Asian countries must adhere to open regionalism, do not engage in closed groups, do not target third countries, and promote foreign countries in the regionThere is no way out for closure, and development can only be achieved when open. Asian countries should adhere to open regionalism, do not engage in closed groups, or target third countries, and promote countries within and outside the region to do their best, complement each other, and share benefits. Neighboring countries should be more open, including the signing of facilitation agreements in the fields of transportation, trade, and investment, the interconnection of cross-border infrastructure, and the convergence and unification of various rules and regulations. , 　　 The most urgent task is to negotiate and solve the problems affecting the systems, policies, and standards of interconnection, and reduce the cost and time of the cross-border movement of people, commodities, and funds. It is necessary to carry out customs cooperation on information exchange, mutual recognition of supervision, and mutual assistance in law enforcement, speed up the construction of ""single windows"" at border ports, and promote the ""one place, two inspections"" inspection model for passengers to go through immigration procedures at the same location. Openness requires respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, taking care of the comfort of all parties, not being difficult for others, and not interfering in other countries’ internal affairs. Opening must be gradual, easy to come first, difficult to follow, and multiplying points by points, accumulating less and more, which will enable the Asian economy to move forward on the road of opening up and allow Asian countries to increase strategic mutual trust in the process of opening up. , 　　——We want to realize the happiness dream of the Asian people. Every new traffic line carries the people's dream of happiness. Through the construction of interconnection in Asia, we will open up a window for the people to observe the world and let their ideals fly, and broaden the road for people to get rid of poverty and become rich. When thinking about and planning interconnection projects, you need to adhere to people-oriented, listen to the opinions of grassroots people, increase their income, and focus on solving their real problems of electricity, drinking water, medical treatment, schooling, employment, and Internet access. At the same time, it is necessary to protect the ecological environment and let beauty and development go hand in hand. , 　　 Through the construction of interconnection in Asia, we should narrow the distance between people's exchange of ideas and mutual learning, so that people of all countries meet and know each other, trust and respect each other, create and enjoy a harmonious and peaceful life, and jointly weave the Asian dream of peace, prosperity and progress. , 　　——We want to build a cooperation platform with Asian characteristics. Relevant international and regional organizations have done a lot of groundbreaking and basic work on Asia interconnection and achieved important results. We attach great importance and appreciate it. It is hoped that the various mechanisms will work together with Asian countries, based on Asian reality, to divide labor and cooperate to form synergy. At the same time, according to the needs of the development of the situation, we must also consider innovative institutional mechanisms. , 　　 Last month, more than 20 Asian countries signed an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding for the establishment of an Asian infrastructure investment bank in Beijing. This is an important breakthrough in Asian financial cooperation. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a useful complement to existing financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and will play an important role in the construction of interconnection in Asia. , 　　 colleagues and friends! , 　　 Last autumn, on behalf of the Chinese government, I put forward an initiative to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which received a positive response from the international community, especially the leaders of the countries present. The ""Belt and Road"" and interconnection are mutually close and complementary. If the ""Belt and Road"" is likened to the two wings that take off in Asia, the interconnection is the meridian of the two wings. At present, the ""Belt and Road"" has entered a stage of pragmatic cooperation. I have the following suggestions for deepening cooperation. , 　　 First, take Asian countries as the key direction and take the lead in achieving Asian interconnection. The ""Belt and Road"" originates from Asia, relies on Asia and benefits Asia, pays attention to the interconnection of Asian countries, and strives to expand the common interests of Asian countries. The “Belt and Road” is a common cause of China and its neighbors in Asia. China regards its neighboring countries as the priority of its foreign policy, practises the concept of pro, sincerity, benefit and tolerance, and is willing to provide more public products to Asian neighbors through interconnection. , Welcome everyone to take the train developed by China. , 　　 Second, relying on the economic corridor to build a basic framework for interconnection in Asia. At present, the ""Belt and Road"" plan formulated by China has basically taken shape. This includes the onshore economic cooperation corridor and the maritime economic cooperation corridor that are being built on the basis of full communication with all parties. This framework takes into account the needs of various countries and balances the two major directions of land and sea, covering a wide area, strong inclusiveness, and great radiation effect. China is willing to further consult with relevant countries, improve the blueprint for cooperation, and lay a solid foundation for cooperation. , 　　 Third, with the transportation infrastructure as a breakthrough, to achieve the early gains of interconnection in Asia. The Silk Road must first have a road, so that people can move freely and things can flow smoothly. China attaches great importance to connecting China and Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tajikistan and other neighboring countries. Railway and highway projects will be given priority in the construction of the ""Belt and Road"". Only let everyone share the early harvest as soon as possible, the ""Belt and Road"" is attractive and vitality. , 　　 Fourth, with the construction financing platform as a starting point, break the bottleneck of interconnection in Asia. Most Asian countries are developing countries, and there is a general lack of construction funds. The key is to revitalize the stock, make good use of increments, and use precious funds on the blade. I'm hereneck. Most Asian countries are developing countries, and there is a general lack of construction funds. The key is to revitalize the stock, make good use of increments, and use precious funds on the blade. I hereby announce that China will invest 40 billion US dollars to establish the Silk Road Fund to provide investment and financing support for projects related to interconnection such as infrastructure, resource development, industrial cooperation and financial cooperation along the “Belt and Road”. The Silk Road Fund is open, and sub-funds can be established according to region, industry or project type, and investors from within and outside the Asian region are welcome to actively participate. , 　　 Fifth, use humanities as a link to strengthen the social foundation of interconnection in Asia. China supports dialogues between different civilizations and religions, encourages strengthening cultural exchanges and non-governmental exchanges between countries, supports countries along the Silk Road to jointly apply for world cultural heritage, and encourages more Asian countries, local provinces, regions and cities to establish cooperative relations. Asia is rich in tourism resources, and more and more people are traveling abroad. It is necessary to develop tourism on the Silk Road, so that tourism cooperation and interconnection construction can mutually promote each other. Interconnection requires a large number of professionals. In the next five years, China will provide 20,000 training places in the field of connectivity to neighboring countries to help neighboring countries develop their own team of experts. China is also willing to send more international students, experts and scholars to study and exchange in neighboring countries. , 　　 colleagues and friends! , 　　Chinese idioms speak like-minded. Let us be ambitious and down-to-earth, deepen the interconnected partnership, optimize regional cooperation in Asia, and jointly build a community of development and fate! ,   thank you all! , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (November 09, 2014, 02 edition),]","Xi Jinping: Unicom leads development, partners focus on cooperation",3486,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-11-09,"[, 　　11月8日，加强互联互通伙伴关系对话会在北京钓鱼台国宾馆举行。国家主席习近平主持会议并发表题为《联通引领发展 伙伴聚焦合作》的重要讲话。新华社记者 李 涛摄, 尊敬的哈米德总统，, 尊敬的朱马里主席，, 尊敬的额勒贝格道尔吉总统，, 尊敬的吴登盛总统，, 尊敬的拉赫蒙总统，, 尊敬的洪森首相，, 尊敬的谢里夫总理，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　首先，大家专程来到北京出席“加强互联互通伙伴关系”东道主伙伴对话会，这是我们深厚友谊和友好合作关系的生动体现，也是大家对中方主办亚太经合组织第二十二次领导人非正式会议的重要支持，我谨向大家表示衷心的感谢！, 　　“朋友越走越近，邻居越走越亲。”邻国之间就一些重大问题面对面交换意见很有必要。中国作为亚太经合组织第二十二次领导人非正式会议东道主，将亚太互联互通作为会议议题之一。考虑到互联互通是件大事，亚洲国家和有关国际组织都很关心，都有参与的愿望，我们同各方商量后决定召开这个会议，共商亚洲发展大计。, 　　中国有个寓言叫“愚公移山”。讲的是几千年前，一个交通不便的山村里有位叫愚公的老人，下决心将挡在家门口的两座大山移开。亲戚和邻居都说不可能，但他力排众议，带着子孙日复一日挖土移山。他说，山不会加大增高，人却子孙无穷，只要持之以恒，总有一天会把大山搬走。愚公的精神感动了天神，两座山在人和神的共同努力下被移开了，愚公的家乡同外界实现了互联互通。, 　　自古以来，互联互通就是人类社会的追求。我们的祖先在极为艰难的条件下，创造了许多互联互通的奇迹。丝绸之路就是一个典范，亚洲各国人民堪称互联互通的开拓者。, 　　人类在发展，社会在进步。当前，国际金融危机影响犹在，世界经济和国际贸易增速放缓。与此同时，新一轮产业革命和科技革命蓄势待发，区域性自由贸易安排层出不穷，结构调整和改革创新成为世界潮流。亚洲国家必须积极作为，在亚洲资源、亚洲制造、亚洲储蓄、亚洲工厂的基础上，致力发展亚洲价值、亚洲创造、亚洲投资、亚洲市场，联手培育新的经济增长点和竞争优势。实现这些目标，互联互通是其中一个关键环节。, 　　今天，我们要建设的互联互通，不仅是修路架桥，不光是平面化和单线条的联通，而更应该是基础设施、制度规章、人员交流三位一体，应该是政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通五大领域齐头并进。这是全方位、立体化、网络状的大联通，是生机勃勃、群策群力的开放系统。, 　　亚洲互联互通建设既面临机遇，也存在困难。各国制度和法律差异较大，各方需求千差万别，各类机制协调不尽人意，等等。资金问题最为突出，据亚洲开发银行测算，2020年以前亚洲地区每年基础设施投资需求高达7300亿美元。解决这些问题，仅靠一个或几个国家努力是做不到的，只有广泛建立伙伴关系，心往一起想，劲朝一处使，才能不断取得积极成效。, 　　——我们要实现亚洲国家联动发展。亚洲各国高度重视互联互通，很多国家有自己的基础设施建设规划。现在，需要对接各国战略和规划，找出优先领域和项目，集中资源，联合推进。这有利于降低物流成本、创造需求和就业、发挥比较优势和后发优势，在全球供应链、产业链、价值链中占据有利位置，提高综合竞争力，打造强劲、可持续、平衡增长的亚洲发展新气象。亚洲各国就像一盏盏明灯，只有串联并联起来，才能让亚洲的夜空灯火辉煌。, 　　——我们要塑造更加开放的亚洲经济格局。面对世界多极化、经济全球化、文化多样化、社会信息化的时代潮流，任何国家都不能关起门来搞建设。封闭没有出路，开放才能发展。亚洲国家要坚持开放的区域主义，不搞封闭性集团，不针对第三国，推动域内外国家各尽其能、优势互补、利益共享。邻国开放应该更多一些，包括商签交通、贸易、投资领域的便利化协定，联通跨境基础设施，衔接和统一各类规章制度。, 　　当务之急是协商解决影响互联互通的制度、政策、标准问题，降低人员、商品、资金跨境流动的成本和时间。有必要开展信息互换、监管互认、执法互助的海关合作，加快边境口岸“单一窗口”建设，推广旅客在同一地点办理出入境手续的“一地两检”查验模式。开放需要尊重各国主权和领土完整，照顾各方舒适度，不强人所难，不干涉他国内政。开放还要循序渐进、先易后难、以点带面、积少成多，使亚洲经济在开放之路上行稳致远，让亚洲各国在开放进程中增强战略互信。, 　　——我们要实现亚洲人民幸福梦想。每一条新的交通线路，都承载人民幸福梦想。我们要通过亚洲互联互通建设，开拓人民观察世界、放飞理想的窗口，拓宽人民脱贫致富的道路。在思考和规划互联互通项目时，需要坚持以人为本，听取基层民众意见，增加基层民众收入，着力解决他们用电、饮水、医疗、上学、就业、上网等现实问题。同时，需要保护生态环境，让美丽和发展同行。, 　　我们要通过亚洲互联互通建设，拉近人民思想交流、文明互鉴的距离，让各国人民相逢相知、互信互敬，创造和享受和谐安宁的生活，共同编织和平、富强、进步的亚洲梦。, 　　——我们要打造亚洲特色的合作平台。有关国际和区域组织已就亚洲互联互通做了许多开创性、基础性的工作，取得重要成果，我们十分重视和赞赏。希望各机制同亚洲各国一道，立足亚洲实际，分工协作，形成合力。同时，根据形势发展需要，我们也要考虑创新体制机制。, 　　上个月，20多个亚洲国家在北京签署了筹建亚洲基础设施投资银行的政府间谅解备忘录，这是亚洲金融合作的重要突破。亚洲基础设施投资银行对世界银行、亚洲开发银行等现有金融机构是有益补充，将在亚洲互联互通建设中扮演重要角色。, 　　各位同事、朋友们！, 　　去年秋天，我代表中国政府提出共同建设丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路的倡议，得到国际社会特别是在座各国领导人积极回应。“一带一路”和互联互通是相融相近、相辅相成的。如果将“一带一路”比喻为亚洲腾飞的两只翅膀，那么互联互通就是两只翅膀的血脉经络。当前，“一带一路”进入了务实合作阶段，我对深化合作有以下几点建议。, 　　第一，以亚洲国家为重点方向，率先实现亚洲互联互通。“一带一路”源于亚洲、依托亚洲、造福亚洲，关注亚洲国家互联互通，努力扩大亚洲国家共同利益。“一带一路”是中国和亚洲邻国的共同事业，中国将周边国家作为外交政策的优先方向，践行亲、诚、惠、容的理念，愿意通过互联互通为亚洲邻国提供更多公共产品，欢迎大家搭乘中国发展的列车。, 　　第二，以经济走廊为依托，建立亚洲互联互通的基本框架。目前，中方制定的“一带一路”规划基本成形。这包括在同各方充分沟通的基础上正在构建的陆上经济合作走廊和海上经济合作走廊。这一框架兼顾各国需求，统筹陆海两大方向，涵盖面宽，包容性强，辐射作用大。中方愿同有关国家进一步协商，完善合作蓝图，打牢合作基础。, 　　第三，以交通基础设施为突破，实现亚洲互联互通的早期收获。丝绸之路首先得要有路，有路才能人畅其行、物畅其流。中方高度重视联通中国和巴基斯坦、孟加拉国、缅甸、老挝、柬埔寨、蒙古国、塔吉克斯坦等邻国的铁路、公路项目，将在推进“一带一路”建设中优先部署。只有让大家尽早分享到早期收获，“一带一路”才有吸引力和生命力。, 　　第四，以建设融资平台为抓手，打破亚洲互联互通的瓶颈。亚洲各国多是发展中国家，普遍缺乏建设资金，关键是盘活存量、用好增量，将宝贵的资金用在刀刃上。我在此宣布，中国将出资400亿美元成立丝路基金，为“一带一路”沿线国家基础设施、资源开发、产业合作和金融合作等与互联互通有关的项目提供投融资支持。丝路基金是开放的，可以根据地区、行业或者项目类型设立子基金，欢迎亚洲域内外的投资者积极参与。, 　　第五，以人文交流为纽带，夯实亚洲互联互通的社会根基。中国支持不同文明和宗教对话，鼓励加强各国文化交流和民间往来，支持丝绸之路沿线国家联合申请世界文化遗产，鼓励更多亚洲国家地方省区市建立合作关系。亚洲旅游资源丰富，出国旅游的人越来越多，应该发展丝绸之路特色旅游，让旅游合作和互联互通建设相互促进。互联互通需要大量专业人才，未来5年，中国将为周边国家提供2万个互联互通领域的培训名额，帮助周边国家培养自己的专家队伍。中国也愿派出更多留学生、专家学者到周边国家学习交流。, 　　各位同事、朋友们！, 　　中国成语讲志同道合。让我们志存高远、脚踏实地，深化互联互通伙伴关系，优化亚洲区域合作，共建发展和命运共同体！, 　　谢谢大家！, 　　（新华社北京11月8日电）  , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2014年11月09日 02 版）, ]",习近平：联通引领发展 伙伴聚焦合作,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25997795
21,119,"[, Ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends: Tonight, Changan Street is shining with bright lights, flowers in front of Tiananmen Square, Beijing in golden autumn, full of festive atmosphere. Our great People's Republic has gone through a glorious course of 65 years. , On October 1, 1949, on the Tiananmen Gate, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared to the world: The People’s Republic of China is established! The first five-star red flag rose slowly over Beijing. The Chinese people who have experienced more than 100 years of struggle in modern times have finally ushered in the dawn of the Chinese nation's rebirth. , ""A rooster roars all over the world."" The birth of the People's Republic of China has made hundreds of millions of Chinese people the masters of the country, society and their own destiny, and embarked on a great journey to realize the prosperity of the country, national rejuvenation and people's happiness. In 65 years, in the history of human development, it was just a flick. However, the Chinese people have created a magnificent and earth-shattering history within this period of time. Over the past 65 years, China has moved from new democracy to socialism, creating and expanding the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, turning socialism, the beautiful ideal of human society, into a successful road and system with great vitality in the ancient Chinese land. . This not only provides an important institutional guarantee for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, but also provides a fully persuasive path and institutional choice for human society towards a better future. In 65 years, China's social productivity and overall national strength have achieved a historic leap, and people's lives have achieved a historic leap from poverty to food and clothing to overall well-being. This not only made China completely throw away the hat of ""sick man in East Asia"", but also provided a successful example for mankind to overcome poverty and find a development path for developing countries. For 65 years, China has pursued an independent foreign policy of peace, adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, upheld justice and justice, and has always stood on the side of the vast number of developing countries and has worked hard to maintain world peace and promote common development. This has not only greatly improved China's international status, but also made significant contributions to promoting world multi-polarization, economic globalization, and democratization of international relations, and promoting the balance of power in the world. , History often requires years of wind and rain to see more clearly. Looking back, we feel more clearly that the establishment of the People’s Republic of China is not only a great event in the history of the development of the Chinese nation, but also a great event in the history of human development. Today, we can proudly say that a China full of vitality, a China full of hope, has stood towering in the east of the world. , Comrades and friends! Here, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I would like to pay tribute to the people of all ethnic groups and all members of the Communist Party of China, to the commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the officers and soldiers of the Armed Police Force, to the democratic parties and non-partisan people! My sincere greetings to the compatriots in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao Special Administrative Region, Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese! My sincere thanks to the friendly countries and international friends who supported and helped the construction of New China! Now, at this moment, we miss all the people who have contributed to national independence and the liberation of the people in the modern era. We also miss the older generation of leaders who have established outstanding achievements for the establishment and development of New China, and even more for the construction of New China. Develop all heroic models and advanced characters who gave their lives. , What can gratify them is that the ideal of their faith is being realized, the cause they started is continuing, and the history they write will surely continue to be written by us. , Comrades and friends! , The moment to review history is also the moment to look forward to the future. The ships of our People's Republic are advancing through the waves, and we are closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history. , Any goal of struggle will not be easily achieved, and the way forward has never been smooth. The road ahead of us is still very long and will not be that smooth. We must prepare for a great struggle with many new historical features. In the past, the Chinese people have the ambition and ability to overcome all kinds of hardships and obstacles and create the glory of our People's Republic. Today, the Chinese people will certainly be able to overcome the foreseeable and unforeseen difficulties and obstacles, and create greater glory in our People's Republic. , ——Facing the future, we must insist on being with the people. The people are the creators of history. We must rely on the people closely, give full play to the role of the people as the main body, respect the people’s initiative, and start business for the people’s officers, and rely on the people’s officers to start the business.

This path is the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people through all kinds of hardships, The huge path that has been developed is the correct path that has been proved by practice and is in line with China's national conditions and suitable for the development of the times.

22,120,"[, Dear President Rahmon, Dear Colleagues,: It is a pleasure to attend the Dushanbe Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Thank you, Chairman Tajikistan, for your careful preparation and thoughtful arrangements for the successful holding of the summit. Over the past year, under the theme of ""year of cooperation and common development and prosperity"", Tajikistan has done a lot of fruitful work for the development of the organization, which China highly appreciates. After the Bishkek summit, the organization has made new progress in cooperation in various fields. According to the summit consensus, all parties fully implemented the ""Outline for the Implementation of the Long-term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty"", work together to combat ""three forces"", drug smuggling, transnational organized crime, and cybercrime, and actively promote practical cooperation in transportation, energy, finance, and agriculture. Carrying out cultural, health, education, disaster relief and other cultural exchanges, and continuously deepening cooperation with observer countries and dialogue partners have demonstrated the vigorous vitality of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and laid a solid foundation for further development. The world today is undergoing profound and complex changes. Favorable conditions for maintaining the overall stability of the international situation are increasing, but the world is still very restless. Various regional conflicts and local wars have occurred one after another, multiple hotspots are heating up at the same time, and tensions and confrontations in some regions have increased. The world economy continues to recover slowly, and new growth momentum is insufficient. Injustice and inequality in international relations are still very prominent. There is still a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. The development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is entering a critical period in the past. It is our shared responsibility and mission to ensure that the Organization always advances along the established track and brings more security and greater well-being to member countries and their people. With a highly responsible attitude towards peace, stability, and development in the region and the world, we must firmly establish a sense of community of common destiny, community of interests, and community of common prosperity, honor and disgrace, unite our strengths, cooperate sincerely, and strive to improve the Shanghai Cooperation Organization towards a more complete mechanism The cooperation is more comprehensive, the coordination is smoother, and the direction of development is more open to the benefit of the people in the region. First, we must insist on maintaining our regional security and stability. Security is the prerequisite for development. Without security, development is impossible. In the face of the grim situation of religious extremism in the region and the confluence of ""terror"" and ""poison"", the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is based on security cooperation, should strengthen its stability maintenance capabilities and effectively seek stability and development for the countries in the region. , Promote people's livelihood to provide reliable security. We should continue to improve the law enforcement and security cooperation system, improve the existing cooperation mechanism, and comprehensively enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies of various countries to maintain stability and control bureaus. , China supports as soon as possible the Shanghai Cooperation Organization regional anti-terrorism organization anti-drug function, and on this basis to establish a center to respond to security challenges and threats, in order to form a joint force, cut off the chain of ""terror"" and ""drug"" link. Therefore, we must deal with both the symptoms and the symptoms, take multiple measures, and coordinate the crackdown on the ""three forces."" At present, we should focus on combating religious extremism and cyber terrorism, focus on eradicating and blocking the roots and transmission channels of terrorist extremism, strengthen the prevention and monitoring of its penetration, and avoid being manipulated by external forces to undermine regional security and stability. Create social unrest. , China recommends that the organization negotiate a counter-extremism convention, study and establish an action mechanism to combat cyber terrorism, regularly hold joint counter-terrorism exercises close to actual combat, and promote the construction of joint counter-terrorism forces. Second, we must adhere to the goal of achieving common development and prosperity. ""For the people of the country is based on the prosperity of the people."" With the increasing uncertainty of the world economic prospects and the rise of trade protectionism in the countries concerned, the Organization should, on the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results, deepen the potential of regional cooperation and create opportunities for cooperation. Enhance the endogenous power and anti-risk ability of member countries' economic development. On the basis of taking care of the interests and concerns of all parties, we should explore broader and higher-level cooperation in the field of trade and investment, provide MFN treatment to each other, advance the process of regional economic integration, and build a unified space for economic, trade, investment, and logistics in the region. All parties should take the opportunity of signing an international road transport facilitation agreement to ensure that the relevant routes are opened on schedule, tap the potential of countries for transit transportation, and drive the development of countries along the route. , The establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization financial institution is of great significance to the development of the region. Countries should further build consensus and reach agreement as soon as possible to provide financial support for large-scale projects that benefit the organization from all sides. We should give full play to the role of energy clubs, strengthen energy policy coordination and supply-demand cooperation among member countries, strengthen cross-border oil and gas pipeline security cooperation, and ensure energy security. We must strengthen the coordination of food policies, expand the trade of agricultural products of member countries, and increase the comprehensive food production capacity. China proposes to hold the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Food Security Forum and formulate the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Science and Technology Partnership Program""To increase the comprehensive grain production capacity. China proposes to hold the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Food Security Forum, formulate the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Science and Technology Partnership Program"", and use the China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization Environmental Protection Cooperation Center to accelerate the construction of an environmental information sharing platform. In order to consolidate and strengthen the regional economic cooperation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China has decided to provide US$ 5 billion in loans to member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for financing cooperation projects. The China-Eurasian Economic Cooperation Fund announced by China at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Prime Minister’s Meeting last year has been officially launched. The fund’s initial scale is 1 billion US dollars, and the final scale will be expanded to 5 billion US dollars. We are willing to provide assistance to the economic development of member countries, observer countries and dialogue partners through this channel. China will also hold the Shanghai Cooperation Organization National Commodity Exhibition during the Western China International Expo in October 2015 to provide more convenience for countries' advantageous products to enter the Chinese market. Thirdly, we must adhere to the purpose of promoting people-to-people communication. ""People are strong."" The future of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is ultimately in the hands of the people of the Organization. We must support business circles, academia, media, think tanks, and literary groups and all walks of life to carry out all-round friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and traditional friendship between peoples of all countries, and build a foundation of social public opinion for the development of the organization. We must actively open up new channels for humane cooperation, strengthen the building of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s international communications capacity, promote the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s theme, and tell more “Shanghai Cooperation Stories” to the world and make more “Shanghai Cooperation Voices”. , China proposes that the SCO countries strengthen media cooperation and hold the SCO Media Cooperation Forum. China supports countries to exchange experiences in public policy and government management, and is willing to provide 2,000 officials, management, and technical personnel training places for member countries of the organization from 2015 to 2017. In the next 5 years, 50 SCO countries will be invited every year Young leaders come to China for training. China will rely on the China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization International Judicial Exchange and Cooperation Training Base to assist member countries in training judicial talents. Next year is the 70th anniversary of the victory of the world's anti-fascist war. We must solemnly commemorate this major historical event, especially to educate young people to remember history and draw lessons from the past. Fourth, we must insist on expanding foreign exchanges and cooperation as the driving force. ""Stones from other mountains can attack jade."" Expanding foreign exchanges and absorbing fresh blood is the need for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to grow and develop itself, and it also conforms to the open and inclusive policy that the organization has always pursued. After more than ten years of careful research and consultation, the legal preparation for the expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has been basically completed, and the expansion of the door will be officially opened. We welcome countries that are willing and meet the standards to apply to become full members of the organization and inject new vitality into the development of the organization. We must strengthen cooperation between member states and observer states, closely communicate with dialogue partners, continue to improve the ""6+5"" working mechanism, and effectively attract observer states and dialogue partners to the relevant cooperation of the Organization. We must work closely with the United Nations and its relevant agencies, the CIS, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Ji’an Treaty Organization and other international and regional organizations to learn from each other’s experience. , China highly appreciates the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Secretariat and the AsiaInfo Secretariat during the AsiaInfo Shanghai Summit this year. As the rotating chairman of AsiaInfo from 2014 to 2016, China actively supports the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and AsiaInfo to strengthen exchanges and cooperation, learn from each other, and develop together. During my visit to Central Asia last year, I put forward an initiative to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt, which received great attention and enthusiastic response from the international community, especially the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. I am deeply encouraged and grateful for this. At present, the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt is entering a new stage of pragmatic cooperation, and the plan formulated by China has basically taken shape. Members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, observer countries, and dialogue partners are welcome to participate actively, discuss business plans, build projects, and share revenue, jointly innovate regional cooperation and South-South cooperation models, and promote the regional interconnection and new industrialization process of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. , Colleagues! At a time when the current international pattern is being adjusted and reformed, the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization faces major opportunities and bright prospects. As a member of the family of this organization, we should adhere to the concept of win-win cooperation, adhere to the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and seek common development, and practice common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable The Asian security concept uses the power of collective, unity, and cooperation to work together to meet threats and challenges, and jointly promote the greater development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The Chinese side fully supports Russia's assumption of the next Shanghai Cooperation Organization as the presidency and holds the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Russia. , I believe that through our solidarity and cooperation and unremitting efforts, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will surely be able to innovate brilliantly and reach a new level! , Thank you. (Xinhua News Agency Dushanbe SeptemberWe work together and make unremitting efforts. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization will surely be able to innovate brilliantly and reach a new level! , Thank you.

23,121,"[, September 10, on the eve of attending the fourteenth meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and a state visit to Tajikistan, State President Xi Jinping published at the same time in the People’s Daily of Tajikistan and the ""Hovar"" National News Agency A signed article titled ""Making China and Tajikistan Friendly Like an Eagle Spreading Their Wings"". The article reads as follows: Let China and Tajikistan friendship like an eagle spread its wings, President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping, China's friendly neighbor Tajikistan has the reputation of ""the country of high mountains"". The Pamirs Plateau, with its layers of mountains and bizarre peaks, is where the eagles spread their wings. The ancient Chinese thinker Confucius said: ""The benevolent Leshan."" Such a majestic and mountainous country, the people are quiet and connotative, fascinating. At the invitation of President Rakhmon, I will soon embark on this beautiful land, make my first state visit to the Republic of Tajikistan, and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Dushanbe Summit. I am full of joy and expectation in visiting good neighbors and good brothers in the autumn season. The friendship between China and Tajikistan began more than 2000 years ago. During the Western Han Dynasty, China's Zhang Qian twice sent to the Western Regions, opening up the famous Silk Road and also opening up the history of friendly exchanges between the people of China and Tajikistan. For more than 2000 years, the camel bells on the Silk Road were crisp and the sound of horseshoes, carrying the friendship and cooperation of the embassy caravan. It promotes the mutual exchange of cultural knowledge between the East and the West, and composes the colorful music movements in the history of human civilization. The eagle that spread its wings on the Pamirs has become a witness to the friendship between the people of China and Tajikistan. 22 years ago, after the Republic of Tajikistan became independent, China became the first country to establish diplomatic relations with Tajikistan. Over the years, China and Tajikistan have made great achievements in promoting the development of bilateral relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two sides successfully resolved the border issues left over by history through equal consultations, and signed a good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaty, laying a solid foundation for the development of bilateral relations. The political mutual trust between the two sides has been increasingly consolidated, mutual support has been continuously strengthened, and cooperation in various fields has been deepened to become a veritable good neighbor, good friend, and good partner. , In May 2013, President Rahmon successfully paid a state visit to China. Mr. President and I jointly signed a joint declaration in Beijing to elevate the relationship between the two countries to a level of strategic partnership. Over the past year, China-Tajikistan relations have shown good momentum of comprehensive and rapid development, and cooperation in various fields has advanced by leaps and bounds. In the first half of this year, bilateral trade volume increased by 48% year-on-year, and the growth momentum was strong. A number of new large-scale cooperation projects have been launched one after another, and the highlights of the cooperation achievements have emerged. The first phase of the China-Tower Highway runs through, the first unit of the Dushanbe No. 2 Thermal Power Plant Phase I project is connected to the grid for power generation, the China-Tower Mining and Smelting Industrial Park starts construction, the construction of the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline D line in Tajikistan and Dushan The second phase of the No. 2 thermal power plant is about to start. The relationship between China and Tajikistan has entered the fast track of all-round development, showing broad prospects for development. , Last month, 200 middle school students from Tajikistan came to China to attend the summer camp. They came from more than 30 cities including Dushanbe. The children were warmly welcomed in Beijing, Tianjin and Urumqi. The youths of the two countries have carried out colorful networking activities to showcase their talents, introduce their own culture, and form deep friendships. The teenagers are the successors of the friendly cause between China and Tajikistan, and they hope to be pinned on them. I believe they will continue to carry forward the friendship between China and Tajikistan. , Looking back at the tremendous achievements made in the development of China-Tajikistan relations, we can summarize the following important lessons. —— Mutual respect is the prerequisite for the smooth development of China-Tajikistan relations. Mutual respect is the essence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the principle that China has always followed in its diplomatic relations. This principle and spirit are also written in the ""Joint Statement on Basic Principles of Mutual Relations between China and Tajikistan"". Countries respect each other, they must respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect each other's independently chosen development path, respect each other's core interests and support each other. Although China and Tajikistan have different social systems, ideologies, ethnic customs, and economic development levels, the two sides always uphold the principle of mutual respect, never impose their will on each other, take care of each other’s concerns to the greatest extent, and consider each other’s concerns. China and Tajikistan are examples of mutual respect and equality. —— Mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation is the driving force for the ever-expanding cooperation between China and Tajikistan. Although China and Tajikistan are at different stages of development, the two sides adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and reciprocity in their cooperation and will never sacrifice each other's interests for their own self-interest. Instead, they will stick to the path of common development and common prosperity. This kind of cooperation for mutual benefit and win-win cooperation has long-term and stability, and its development trend will surely be the continuous expansion of cooperation scale and further improvement of cooperation level. ——The friendship between the people is the guarantee of the friendship between China and Tajikistan. The people of China and Tajikistan have more than 2000 years of friendly exchanges. Since entering the new era, the twohigh. ——The friendship between the people is the guarantee of the friendship between China and Tajikistan. The people of China and Tajikistan have more than 2000 years of friendly exchanges. Since entering the new era, the mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries have been deepened, which is reflected in all levels and fields of bilateral exchanges. The deep foundation of public opinion keeps the friendship between China and Tajikistan free from external factors and will not change because of one incident at a time. The idea that China and Tajikistan will always be good neighbors, good friends and good partners is deeply rooted. At present, the international and regional situation is undergoing profound and complex changes. Compared with when the two countries established diplomatic relations more than 20 years ago, the world is already very different. Nevertheless, peace and development remain the themes of the times, and seeking peace, development, and cooperation are still the common aspirations of people of all countries. Continuously deepening good-neighborly friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries is the basic policy of China's diplomacy and will never change. We will adhere to the neighboring foreign policy of being good neighbors and partners, and the neighboring foreign policy of good-neighborliness, security and prosperity, and implement the concept of pro-, sincere, beneficial and tolerant neighboring diplomacy, and further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries. Make efforts to make China's development better benefit the neighboring countries and people. China's investment in the surrounding area will only increase, not decrease; the level of cooperation between China and neighboring countries will only increase, not decrease. , Good dear, good dear. Tajikistan is an important neighbor of China, and China-Tajikistan relations are at the highest level in history. China attaches great importance to relations with Tajikistan and regards Tajikistan as an important partner for China's opening to the west. I sincerely hope that through this visit, China and Tajikistan will consolidate mutual political trust, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in security, economics, humanities and other fields, strengthen strategic coordination and cooperation between the two countries, and promote the ""100-footed, further progress"" in China-Tajikistan relations. , In September last year, China proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative, which received active support and response from countries including Tajikistan. At present, the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt has entered a stage of pragmatic cooperation. Tajikistan is an important country along the Silk Road. Standing at a new historical starting point, we are willing to work together with the Tajik side to take the opportunity of building the Silk Road Economic Belt to push the cooperation between the two countries to a deeper and higher level and better benefit both countries and peoples. ——We will work to strengthen policy communication, promote the coordination and docking of national development strategies of the two countries, jointly provide policy support for the implementation of large-scale cooperation projects between the two countries, and work together to build a good trade and investment environment. -We will work to promote smooth trade, give full play to the coordination and guidance role of the China-Tajica Government Economic and Trade Cooperation Committee, actively guide the balanced development of trade between the two countries, continuously expand trade scale, enrich trade types, and optimize trade structure. ——We will work to achieve road connectivity, jointly promote the construction of transportation infrastructure interconnection between the two countries and the region, build a long-term and stable port management cooperation mechanism between the two governments and border local governments, and improve the capacity of the two countries' border ports. ——We will work to promote currency circulation, actively carry out mutually beneficial cooperation between the central banks and commercial banks of the two countries, expand the use of the local currencies of the two countries in bilateral trade and investment, and provide convenience for the counterparty's business in the country. -We will work to expand people-to-people communication, strengthen friendly exchanges between educational and scientific research institutions, news media, non-governmental friendly organizations, cultural groups, and youth organizations of the two countries, and continuously enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries, so that friendship between China and Tajikistan will be passed on from generation to generation. , Another important agenda for me in Tajikistan is to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. The SCO is an important platform for close cooperation between China and Tajikistan at the international and regional levels. Within the framework of the SCO, we, together with other member states, actively practice the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and seek common development. We have established a long-term good-neighborly, friendly and cooperative relationship and created it with practical actions. A new model of international relations that partners and does not align. In the 13 years since its founding, the SCO has adhered to security cooperation as the foundation, economic and trade cooperation as the guarantee, and people-to-people exchanges as the driving force. It has taken substantial steps in responding to security threats and challenges, and has taken a number of pragmatic measures to continuously deepen economic cooperation. And humanities cooperation. The SCO has established a regional anti-terrorism agency and signed the Shanghai Convention against ""Three Forces."" To date, more than 10 joint anti-terrorism exercises have been held, which has effectively deterred regional terrorist extremist forces. The SCO has achieved fruitful cooperation in the fields of transportation, energy, infrastructure construction, and agriculture, which has strongly promoted the economic development of member countries. In 2013, the GDP of member countries exceeded US$11 trillion, and the proportion of the world economy increased from 4.8% when it was established in 2001 to 14.9%. The exchanges and cooperation between various sectors of the society of member countries are becoming closer and closer, consolidating traditional friendship. At present, the SCO's three major tasks of maintaining safety, promoting development and improving people's livelihood are more urgent. With a higher level of mutual trust, more effective cooperation, and closer integration of interests, the organization’s ability to respond to threats and challenges is enhancedThe three tasks of good people's livelihood are even more urgent. With a higher level of mutual trust, more effective cooperation, and closer integration of interests, it has become the consensus of all member states to enhance the organization’s ability to respond to threats and to consolidate the basis for pragmatic cooperation and cultural cooperation. As the current chairman of the SCO, Tajikistan has made tangible contributions to deepening the unity, mutual trust and practical cooperation of the organization. China is willing to work together with Tajikistan and other member states to hold the Dushanbe summit well, so that the SCO can better safeguard the security and development interests of the region and benefit the people of all countries. , For a thousand miles, to a higher level. This is my expectation for the development of China-Tajikistan relations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. We are willing to work hand in hand with Tajik partners and make unremitting efforts to achieve our common goals. (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 10th), ""People's Daily"" (September 11, 2014, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in Tajikistan media,3232,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-09-11,"[, 9月10日，在出席上海合作组织成员国元首理事会第十四次会议并对塔吉克斯坦进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在塔吉克斯坦《人民报》和“霍瓦尔”国家通讯社同时发表题为《让中塔友好像雄鹰展翅》的署名文章。文章如下：, 让中塔友好像雄鹰展翅, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 中国的友好邻邦塔吉克斯坦有“高山之国”的美称。层峦叠嶂、奇峰林立的帕米尔高原，是雄鹰展翅翱翔的地方。中国古代思想家孔子说：“仁者乐山。”这样一个雄壮多山的国度，人民宁静而有内涵，令人神往。, 应拉赫蒙总统邀请，我即将踏上这片秀丽的土地，对塔吉克斯坦共和国进行首次国事访问，并出席上海合作组织杜尚别峰会。在秋高气爽的时节到好邻居、好兄弟家中作客，我满怀欣喜和期待。, 中塔友谊起始于2000多年前。西汉时期，中国的张骞两次出使西域，开辟了著名的丝绸之路，也开启了中塔两国人民友好交往的历史。2000多年来，丝路上驼铃清脆、马蹄声声，承载着友谊和合作的使团商队往来不绝。推动了东西方文化交流互鉴，谱写出人类文明史上的华彩乐章。帕米尔高原展翅飞翔的雄鹰成为中塔人民世代友好的见证。, 22年前，塔吉克斯坦共和国独立后，中国成为第一批同塔吉克斯坦建立外交关系的国家。多年来，中塔双方在和平共处五项原则的基础上，推动两国关系发展取得重大成就。双方通过平等协商圆满解决了历史遗留的边界问题，签署了睦邻友好合作条约，为两国关系发展奠定了坚实基础。双方政治互信日益巩固，相互支持不断加强，各领域合作深入开展，成为名副其实的好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴。, 2013年5月，拉赫蒙总统成功对中国进行国事访问，我和总统先生在北京共同签署联合宣言，将两国关系提升至战略伙伴关系水平。一年多来，中塔关系呈现全面快速发展良好势头，各领域合作突飞猛进。今年上半年，双边贸易额同比增长48%，增长势头强劲。一批新的大型合作项目陆续上马，合作成果亮点纷呈。中塔公路一期全线贯通，杜尚别2号热电厂一期工程第一台机组并网发电，中塔矿业冶炼工业园启动建设，中国—中亚天然气管道D线塔吉克斯坦境内段建设和杜尚别2号热电厂二期即将开工。中塔关系进入全面发展的快车道，展现出广阔发展前景。, 上个月，塔吉克斯坦200名中学生来华出席夏令营活动，他们来自杜尚别等30多个城市。孩子们在北京、天津、乌鲁木齐受到热烈欢迎。两国青少年开展了丰富多彩的联谊活动，相互展示才艺，介绍本国文化，结下深厚友谊。青少年是中塔友好事业接班人，希望寄托在他们身上。相信他们一定能把中塔友好事业不断发扬光大。, 回顾中塔关系发展取得的巨大成就，我们可以总结出以下几条重要经验。, ——相互尊重是中塔关系顺利发展的前提。相互尊重是和平共处五项原则的精髓，是中国对外交往始终遵循的原则。这一原则和精神也写入了《关于中塔相互关系基本原则的联合声明》。国与国相互尊重，必须彼此尊重国家主权和领土完整，彼此尊重自主选择的发展道路，彼此尊重核心利益并相互支持。尽管中塔两国社会制度、意识形态、民族习惯、经济发展水平不同，但双方始终秉持相互尊重原则，绝不把自己的意志强加于对方，最大限度照顾对方关切，设身处地为对方着想。中塔两国是相互尊重、平等相待的典范。, ——互利共赢是中塔合作不断扩大的动力。中塔两国尽管发展阶段不同，但双方在合作中坚持互利互惠原则，绝不牺牲对方利益谋求一己私利，而是坚持走共同发展、共同繁荣的道路。这种以互利共赢为目的的合作具有长期性、稳定性，其发展趋势必将是合作规模不断扩大和合作水平进一步提高。, ——人民友谊是中塔世代友好的保障。中塔两国人民有着2000多年友好交往史。进入新时期以来，两国人民相互了解和友谊不断加深，体现在双边交往的各个层面、各个领域。深厚的民意基础使中塔友好事业不受外部因素影响，不因一时一事改变。中塔两国永做好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴的理念深入人心。, 当前，国际和地区形势正在发生深刻复杂变化。同20多年前中塔建交时相比，世界已经大不相同。尽管如此，和平与发展依然是时代主题，求和平、谋发展、促合作依然是各国人民共同愿望。不断深化同周边国家的睦邻友好和互利合作是中国外交的基本政策，永远不会改变。我们将坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴的周边外交方针和睦邻、安邻、富邻的周边外交政策，贯彻亲、诚、惠、容的周边外交理念，进一步同周边国家深化互利合作，努力使中国发展更好惠及周边国家和人民。中国对周边的投入只会增加，不会减少；中国同周边国家的合作水平只会提高，不会降低。, 亲望亲好，邻望邻好。塔吉克斯坦是中国的重要邻国，中塔关系正处于历史最高水平。中方高度重视对塔关系，视塔吉克斯坦为中国向西开放的重要合作伙伴。我真诚希望通过这次访问，巩固中塔政治互信，深化安全、经济、人文等领域互利合作，加强两国战略协调和配合，推动中塔关系“百尺竿头，更进一步”。, 去年9月中方提出建设丝绸之路经济带倡议，得到包括塔吉克斯坦在内的各国积极支持和响应。目前，丝绸之路经济带建设已经进入务实合作阶段。塔吉克斯坦是丝绸之路重要沿线国家。站在新的历史起点上，我们愿同塔方携手努力，以建设丝绸之路经济带为契机，推动两国合作向更深层次、更高水平跨越，更好造福两国和两国人民。, ——我们将致力于加强政策沟通，推动两国国家发展战略协调和对接，共同为两国大型合作项目实施提供政策支持，携手构建良好贸易和投资环境。, ——我们将致力于促进贸易畅通，发挥好中塔政府间经贸合作委员会协调和指导作用，积极引导两国贸易均衡发展，不断扩大贸易规模，丰富贸易种类，优化贸易结构。, ——我们将致力于实现道路联通，共同推动两国之间以及本地区交通基础设施互联互通建设，构建两国政府和边境地方政府长期稳定的口岸管理合作机制，提高两国边境口岸通行能力。, ——我们将致力于推动货币流通，积极开展两国央行及商业银行互利合作，扩大两国本币在双边贸易和投资中的使用，为对方银行在本国开展业务提供便利。, ——我们将致力于扩大民心相通，加强两国教育科研机构、新闻媒体、民间友好组织、文艺团体和青年组织友好交流，不断增进两国人民相互了解和友谊，让中塔友好世代相传。, 我在塔吉克斯坦的另一项重要日程是出席上海合作组织峰会。上合组织是中塔在国际和地区层面密切协作的重要平台。在上合组织框架内，我们同其他成员国一道，积极践行互信、互利、平等、协商、尊重多样文明、谋求共同发展的“上海精神”，确立了长期睦邻友好合作关系，以实际行动开创了结伴而不结盟的国际关系新模式。, 上合组织成立13年来，坚持以安全合作为基础，以经贸合作为保障，以人文交流为动力，在应对安全威胁和挑战方面迈出实质性步伐，并采取多项务实举措不断深化经济合作和人文合作。上合组织成立了地区反恐怖机构，签署了打击“三股势力”的上海公约，迄今已经举行10余次联合反恐演习，有力震慑了地区恐怖极端势力。上合组织交通、能源、基础设施建设、农业等领域合作成果丰硕，有力推动了成员国经济发展。2013年，成员国国内生产总值超过11万亿美元，占世界经济总量的比例由2001年成立时的4.8%上升到14.9%。成员国社会各界交流合作日益密切，巩固了传统友谊。, 当前，上合组织维护安全、促进发展、改善民生三大任务更加紧迫。以更高水平的互信、更有效的合作、更紧密的利益融合，增强本组织应对威胁挑战的能力，夯实务实合作和人文合作基础，已成为全体成员国的共识。, 塔方作为上合组织现任主席国，为深化组织团结互信和务实合作作出了实实在在的贡献。中方愿同塔方和其他成员国一道努力，开好杜尚别峰会，使上合组织更好维护本地区安全和发展利益，更好造福各国人民。, 欲穷千里目，更上一层楼。这是我对中塔关系和上海合作组织发展的期许。我们愿同塔方伙伴携手并肩，为实现我们共同的目标而不懈努力。（新华社北京9月10日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年09月11日 01 版）, ]",习近平在塔吉克斯坦媒体发表署名文章,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25637865
24,122,"[, Dear Prime Minister Jabir, Mr. Arabi, Secretary-General of the Arab League, heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen, friends:, Salam-Alekon! Hello everyone! Today, I am very happy to have the opportunity to gather with Arab friends to discuss the construction of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum and the development of China-Arab relations. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all the guests present! My sincere congratulations to the 6th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum! , 　　Meeting with Arab friends, I always feel the same as before. This sense of closeness stems from our enthusiasm and sincerity towards each other, and also from the long-term exchanges between the two ethnic groups. , 　　 Looking back on the history of the exchanges between the Chinese and Arab peoples, we will think of the Silk Road on the land and the Spice Road on the sea. Our ancestors ""walked their lives on the Gobi Desert"", ""in the vast ocean and the sky, the sky and the sky stretched high,"" and walked in the forefront of the friendly exchanges between various ethnic groups in the ancient world. Gan Ying, Zheng He, and Ibn Battuta are familiar messengers of China-Arab exchanges. The Silk Road spread Chinese papermaking, gunpowder, printing, and compasses to Europe through the Arab region, and introduced Arab astronomy, calendar, and medicine to China, writing an important chapter in the history of civilization exchanges and mutual learning. For thousands of years, the spirit of peace, cooperation, openness and tolerance, mutual learning, mutual benefit and mutual benefit carried by the Silk Road have been handed down. The Chinese and Arab peoples support each other in the struggle to safeguard national dignity and national sovereignty, help each other in exploring the path of development and realizing national rejuvenation, and learn from each other in the cause of deepening cultural exchanges and prospering national culture.　　 We will not forget that at the Bandung Conference 60 years ago, China promised to the Arab countries that have not established diplomatic relations to support the struggle of the Palestinian people; more than 40 years ago, 13 Arab countries and African friends voted in favor of the new China to restore the UN seat. We will not forget that nearly 10,000 Chinese doctors rushed across the fields and countryside of the Arab countries to save lives and help the wounded. After the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan, the most generous assistance came from the Arab brothers. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 The next 10 years will be a critical period of development for both China and Afghanistan. China has entered a decisive stage of fully building a well-off society. Achieving this goal is a key step in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. To this end, we have made an overall plan to deepen reforms. One of our efforts is to develop international cooperation in a comprehensive and multi-level manner with a more complete and dynamic open economic system, and to expand the convergence of interests with countries and regions for mutual benefit and win-win results. . The Middle East is undergoing unprecedented major changes and adjustments, and Arab countries are independently exploring changes. To realize the common mission and challenges of national rejuvenation, we need to carry forward the spirit of the Silk Road, add momentum to development, add vitality to cooperation, and continuously deepen the comprehensive cooperation and common development of the Sino-Arab strategic cooperative relationship. , 　　——To promote the spirit of the Silk Road is to promote mutual learning between civilizations. Human civilization has no distinction between high and low, and it has become rich and colorful because of equal exchanges. As the so-called ""five colors intersect and complement each other; the octave ensemble is peaceful and peaceful"". China and Arab countries insist on treating each other with an open and inclusive mindset, replacing dialogue and confrontation with dialogue and communication, and created a model of harmonious coexistence between countries with different social systems, different beliefs, and different cultural traditions. China will continue to unwaveringly support Arab countries in safeguarding their national cultural traditions and oppose all discrimination and prejudice against specific ethnic groups and religions. We should work together to promote civilization tolerance and prevent extreme forces and ideas from creating fault lines between different civilizations. , 　　——To promote the spirit of the Silk Road is to respect the choice of the road. ""Performance does not need to be the same, and the period is sufficient; governance does not need to be the same, and the period benefits the people."" A country's development path is inappropriate, and only the people of this country have the most say. Just as we cannot require all flowers to become violets, nor can we require countries with different cultural traditions, historical encounters, and actual national conditions to adopt the same development model. Otherwise, the world is too monotonous. Arab countries are independently exploring the path of development. We are willing to share the experience of governing and governing the country with our Arab friends, and draw wisdom from our respective ancient civilizations and development practices. , 　　——To promote the spirit of the Silk Road is to insist on win-win cooperation. China pursues common development. We must not only allow ourselves to live well, but also allow others to live well. In the next five years, China will import more than US$10 trillion in commodities and its foreign direct investment will exceed US$500 billion. In 2013, China imported 140 billion US dollars from Arab countries, accounting for only 2Foreign direct investment will exceed US$500 billion. In 2013, China imported 140 billion U.S. dollars from Arab countries, accounting for only 7% of the total annual imports of 2 trillion U.S. dollars. Direct investment in Arab countries was 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for only 2.2% of the total annual foreign direct investment of 100 billion U.S. dollars. %. The gap is also a potential and an opportunity. China is willing to connect its own development with the development of Arab countries and provide support for Arab countries to expand employment, promote industrialization, and promote economic development. , 　　——To promote the spirit of the Silk Road is to advocate dialogue and peace. China firmly supports the Middle East peace process and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital and full sovereignty. It is hoped that all parties concerned will take practical measures to eliminate obstacles to peace talks and break the deadlock in peace talks as soon as possible. China respects the reasonable demands of the Syrian people, supports the implementation of the Geneva Communique as soon as possible, opens an inclusive political transition, and achieves a political solution to the Syrian issue. China attaches great importance to the humanitarian situation in Syria, and to alleviate the humanitarian disaster, it will provide a new batch of humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and other countries. China supports the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and opposes any attempt to change the political landscape of the Middle East. China will participate in regional affairs in a constructive manner, preside over justice and justice, and work with Arab countries to promote dialogue to find the largest convention of concern to all parties and provide more public products for properly solving regional hotspot issues. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 ""One Belt, One Road"" is a road of mutual benefit and win-win situation, which will drive the economies of all countries to be more closely integrated, promote the construction of infrastructure and innovation of systems and mechanisms in various countries, create new economic and employment growth points, and enhance the endogenous power and anti-risk capabilities of each country's economy . , 　　 China and Arab countries know and intersect because of the Silk Road, and we are natural partners in jointly building the “Belt and Road” initiative. , 　　——The construction of the “One Belt, One Road” between China and Arab countries should adhere to the principles of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing. To discuss together is to brainstorm and discuss good things, so that the ""Belt and Road"" construction will take into account the interests and concerns of both parties, reflecting the wisdom and creativity of both parties. Co-building means that the directors of the various departments do their best to give full play to the strengths and potentials of the two sides, gather sand into towers, and build up water into abyss, so as to promote it persistently. Sharing is to make the construction results more and more fair to the people of China and Arab countries, and build a community of interests and a community of destiny between China and Arab countries. , 　　-The construction of the ""One Belt, One Road"" by the Chinese and Arab Communists requires both high aspirations and down-to-earth. To ascend and look far is to do a top-level design, plan the direction and goals, and build a ""1+2+3"" cooperation pattern. ""1"" is to take energy cooperation as the main axis, deepen cooperation in the entire industry chain in the oil and gas field, maintain the safety of energy transportation channels, and build a mutually beneficial, safe, reliable, and long-term friendly Sino-Arab energy strategic cooperation relationship. ""2"" takes infrastructure construction, trade and investment facilitation as two wings, strengthens China-Arab cooperation on major development projects and iconic livelihood projects, and establishes relevant institutional arrangements to promote bilateral trade and investment. China will encourage Chinese companies to import more non-petroleum products from Afghanistan, optimize the trade structure, and strive to increase the trade volume between China and Afghanistan from US$240 billion last year to US$600 billion in the next 10 years. China will encourage Chinese companies to invest in Arab countries in energy, petrochemical, agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors, and strive to increase China's financial investment in Afghanistan and Africa from US$10 billion last year to more than US$60 billion in the next 10 years. ""3"" takes the three high-tech fields of nuclear energy, aerospace satellites and new energy as breakthroughs, and strives to improve the level of pragmatic cooperation between China and Afghanistan. The two sides can discuss the establishment of a China-Arab technology transfer center, jointly build an Arab peaceful use nuclear energy training center, and study the landing of China's Beidou satellite navigation system in the Arab project. , 　　 down to earth, is to strive for early harvest. The Arabic proverb says: ""The language proven by action is the most powerful language."" As long as China and Arab countries have consensus and basic projects, such as the China-Gulf Arab States Cooperation Committee Free Trade Zone, China-UAE Joint Investment Fund, and Arab countries Participation in the preparation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, etc., should speed up consultations and advancement, and strive for maturity and realization. The sooner the “Belt and Road” construction achieves tangible results, the more it can mobilize the polarities of all parties and exert its leading and demonstration effects. , 　　-The construction of the ""One Belt, One Road"" by the China-Arab Communist Party should rely on and enhance the traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan. People-to-people communication is an important part of the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" and a key foundation. I hereby announce that China and Afghanistan have decided to designate 2014 and 2015 as the China-Arab Friendship Year and hold a series of friendly exchange activities within this framework. We are also willing to expand the scale of cultural exchange activities such as art festivals with Algeria and encourage more young students to go to the other countryA series of friendly exchange activities are held in the country. We are also willing to expand the scale of cultural exchange activities such as mutual art festivals with Algeria, encourage more young students to study or exchange in the other country, and strengthen cooperation in the fields of tourism, aviation, press and publication. In the next three years, we will train another 6,000 talents of various types for the Arab countries, share development and poverty reduction experience with the Arab side, and exchange advanced and applicable technologies from China. In the next 10 years, we will organize exchanges and exchanges between 10,000 Chinese and Arab artists, promote and support 200 Chinese and Arab cultural institutions to carry out counterpart cooperation, and invite and support 500 Arab cultural and artistic talents to study in China. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 The establishment of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum is a strategic choice we have made in view of the long-term development of China-Arab relations. After 10 years of development, the forum has become an effective starting point for enriching the strategic connotation of China-Arab relations and promoting pragmatic cooperation between China and Afghanistan. The joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is a new opportunity and starting point for the development of the forum. Seizing this opportunity, we can ensure that the current development is not stopping and the future development is sustainable. Standing at this new starting point, we can gain more space for development and inspire more lasting development momentum. In a nutshell, the construction of the forum needs to be carried out on the ground and act as a fulcrum. , 　　——We must rely on the forum fulcrum to strengthen policy communication. We should treat each other candidly, without fear of differences or avoiding problems, fully exchange our respective foreign policies and development strategies, enhance political mutual trust, promote strategic docking, and provide policy assistance for China-Arab cooperation. , 　　——We should rely on the forum fulcrum to deepen pragmatic cooperation. The development endowments between China and Arab countries are highly complementary. We must make full use of the potential of resource sharing and learn from each other's strengths, dialogue in the most clear language, and cooperation in the most intimate way. Collective cooperation does not pursue a sensation, but more emphasis on the foundation and long-term measures. , 　　——We must rely on the forum fulcrum and continue to innovate. The vitality of the forum is innovation. Both of us must use new ideas, launch new measures, and create new mechanisms to try to solve the various difficulties encountered in pragmatic cooperation, and use the spirit of reform and innovation to break practical bottlenecks and unlock cooperation potential. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The rapid development of China-Arab relations has also more closely linked the destiny of ordinary people on both sides. In Zhejiang, where I used to work, there is such a story. In Yiwu, where Arab merchants are gathered, a Jordanian businessman named Muhamed opened an authentic Arab restaurant. He brought the original Arabic food culture to Yiwu, and also gained success in the prosperity of Yiwu. Eventually, he tied the knot with the Chinese girl and took root in China. An ordinary Arab young man, integrating his dream of life into the Chinese dream of Chinese people pursuing happiness, perseveringly struggled, interpreted a brilliant life, and interpreted the perfect combination of the Chinese dream and the Arab dream. , 　　 The Chinese nation and the Arab nation have created splendid civilizations. Since modern times, they have experienced twists and turns in the changes of the times. The realization of national rejuvenation has always been our pursuit. Let us join hands to carry forward the spirit of the Silk Road, deepen China-Arab cooperation, and work hard for the Chinese Dream and Arab revitalization! Struggle for the noble cause of human peace and development! , 　　 Shukla! Thank you! , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 5), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (June 06, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Carry forward the spirit of the Silk Road and deepen China-Arab cooperation,4043,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-06-06,"[, 尊敬的贾比尔首相殿下，, 阿盟秘书长阿拉比先生，各位代表团团长，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　萨拉姆—阿莱孔！大家好！今天，有机会同阿拉伯朋友欢聚一堂，共商中阿合作论坛建设和中阿关系发展大计，感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向与会各位嘉宾，表示热烈欢迎！向中阿合作论坛第六届部长级会议的召开，表示衷心祝贺！, 　　同阿拉伯朋友见面，总有一见如故的感觉。这种亲近感缘于我们对待彼此的热情和真诚，也是缘于中阿两个民族的长期交往。, 　　回顾中阿人民交往历史，我们就会想起陆上丝绸之路和海上香料之路。我们的祖先在大漠戈壁上“驰命走驿，不绝于时月”，在汪洋大海中“云帆高张，昼夜星驰”，走在了古代世界各民族友好交往的前列。甘英、郑和、伊本·白图泰是我们熟悉的中阿交流友好使者。丝绸之路把中国的造纸术、火药、印刷术、指南针经阿拉伯地区传播到欧洲，又把阿拉伯的天文、历法、医药介绍到中国，在文明交流互鉴史上写下了重要篇章。, 　　千百年来，丝绸之路承载的和平合作、开放包容、互学互鉴、互利共赢精神薪火相传。中阿人民在维护民族尊严、捍卫国家主权的斗争中相互支持，在探索发展道路、实现民族振兴的道路上相互帮助，在深化人文交流、繁荣民族文化的事业中相互借鉴。, 　　我们不会忘记，60年前的万隆会议上，中国向尚未建交的阿拉伯国家承诺支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争；40多年前，13个阿拉伯国家和非洲朋友一道，投票赞成新中国恢复联合国席位。我们不会忘记，近万名中国医生奔走在阿拉伯国家田野乡间，救死扶伤；而在四川汶川特大地震灾害发生后，最慷慨的援助来自阿拉伯兄弟。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　未来10年，对中阿双方都是发展的关键时期。中国已经进入全面建成小康社会的决定性阶段。实现这个目标是实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的关键一步。我们为此作出全面深化改革的总体部署，着力点之一就是以更完善、更具活力的开放型经济体系，全方位、多层次发展国际合作，扩大同各国各地区的利益汇合、互利共赢。中东正在经历前所未有的大变动大调整，阿拉伯国家正在自主探索变革。实现民族振兴的共同使命和挑战，需要我们弘扬丝绸之路精神，为发展增动力，为合作添活力，不断深化全面合作、共同发展的中阿战略合作关系。, 　　——弘扬丝路精神，就是要促进文明互鉴。人类文明没有高低优劣之分，因为平等交流而变得丰富多彩，正所谓“五色交辉，相得益彰；八音合奏，终和且平”。中阿双方坚持以开放包容心态看待对方，用对话交流代替冲突对抗，创造了不同社会制度、不同信仰、不同文化传统的国家和谐相处的典范。中国将继续毫不动摇支持阿拉伯国家维护民族文化传统，反对一切针对特定民族和宗教的歧视和偏见。我们应该一道努力，倡导文明宽容，防止极端势力和思想在不同文明之间制造断层线。, 　　——弘扬丝路精神，就是要尊重道路选择。“履不必同，期于适足；治不必同，期于利民。”一个国家发展道路合不合适，只有这个国家的人民才最有发言权。正像我们不能要求所有花朵都变成紫罗兰这一种花，我们也不能要求有着不同文化传统、历史遭遇、现实国情的国家都采用同一种发展模式。否则，这个世界就太单调了。阿拉伯国家正在自主探索发展道路。我们愿意同阿拉伯朋友分享治国理政经验，从各自古老文明和发展实践中汲取智慧。, 　　——弘扬丝路精神，就是要坚持合作共赢。中国追求的是共同发展。我们既要让自己过得好，也要让别人过得好。未来5年，中国将进口超过10万亿美元的商品，对外直接投资将超过5000亿美元。2013年，中国从阿拉伯国家进口商品1400亿美元，只占今后每年2万亿美元进口商品总额的7%，对阿拉伯国家直接投资22亿美元，只占今后每年1000亿美元对外直接投资总额的2.2%。差距也是潜力，更是机遇。中国愿意把自身发展同阿拉伯国家发展对接起来，为阿拉伯国家扩大就业、推进工业化、推动经济发展提供支持。, 　　——弘扬丝路精神，就是要倡导对话和平。中国坚定支持中东和平进程，支持建立以1967年边界为基础、以东耶路撒冷为首都、享有完全主权的独立的巴勒斯坦国。希望有关各方采取切实措施，消除和谈障碍，尽快打破和谈僵局。中国尊重叙利亚人民合理诉求，支持尽快落实日内瓦公报，开启包容性政治过渡，实现叙利亚问题政治解决。中国高度关注叙利亚人道主义状况，为缓解人道灾难，将向在约旦、黎巴嫩等国的叙利亚难民提供新一批人道主义援助。中国支持建立中东无核武器区，反对任何改变中东政治版图的企图。中国将以建设性姿态参与地区事务，主持公道、伸张正义，同阿拉伯国家一道，推动通过对话找到各方关切的最大公约数，为妥善解决地区热点问题提供更多公共产品。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　“一带一路”是互利共赢之路，将带动各国经济更加紧密结合起来，推动各国基础设施建设和体制机制创新，创造新的经济和就业增长点，增强各国经济内生动力和抗风险能力。, 　　中国同阿拉伯国家因为丝绸之路相知相交，我们是共建“一带一路”的天然合作伙伴。, 　　——中阿共建“一带一路”，应该坚持共商、共建、共享原则。共商，就是集思广益，好事大家商量着办，使“一带一路”建设兼顾双方利益和关切，体现双方智慧和创意。共建，就是各施所长，各尽所能，把双方优势和潜能充分发挥出来，聚沙成塔，积水成渊，持之以恒加以推进。共享，就是让建设成果更多更公平惠及中阿人民，打造中阿利益共同体和命运共同体。, 　　——中阿共建“一带一路”，既要登高望远、也要脚踏实地。登高望远，就是要做好顶层设计，规划好方向和目标，构建“1+2+3”合作格局。“1”是以能源合作为主轴，深化油气领域全产业链合作，维护能源运输通道安全，构建互惠互利、安全可靠、长期友好的中阿能源战略合作关系。“2”是以基础设施建设、贸易和投资便利化为两翼，加强中阿在重大发展项目、标志性民生项目上的合作，为促进双边贸易和投资建立相关制度性安排。中方将鼓励中国企业自阿方进口更多非石油产品，优化贸易结构，争取中阿贸易额从去年的2400亿美元在未来10年增至6000亿美元。中方将鼓励中国企业投资阿拉伯国家能源、石化、农业、制造业、服务业等领域，争取中国对阿非金融类投资存量从去年的100亿美元在未来10年增至600亿美元以上。“3”是以核能、航天卫星、新能源三大高新领域为突破口，努力提升中阿务实合作层次。双方可以探讨设立中阿技术转移中心，共建阿拉伯和平利用核能培训中心，研究中国北斗卫星导航系统落地阿拉伯项目。, 　　脚踏实地，就是要争取早期收获。阿拉伯谚语说：“被行动证明的语言是最有力的语言。”只要中阿双方有共识、有基础的项目，如中国—海湾阿拉伯国家合作委员会自由贸易区、中国—阿联酋共同投资基金、阿拉伯国家参与亚洲基础设施投资银行筹建等，都应该加快协商和推进，争取成熟一项实现一项。“一带一路”建设越早取得实实在在的成果，就越能调动各方面积极性，发挥引领和示范效应。, 　　——中阿共建“一带一路”，应该依托并增进中阿传统友谊。民心相通是“一带一路”建设的重要内容，也是关键基础。我在这里宣布，中阿双方决定把2014年和2015年定为中阿友好年，并在这一框架内举办一系列友好交流活动。我们也愿意同阿方扩大互办艺术节等文化交流活动规模，鼓励更多青年学生赴对方国家留学或交流，加强旅游、航空、新闻出版等领域合作。今后3年，我们将为阿拉伯国家再培训6000名各类人才，同阿方分享发展、减贫等方面经验，交流中方的先进适用技术。未来10年，我们将组织10000名中阿艺术家互访交流，推动并支持200家中阿文化机构开展对口合作，邀请并支持500名阿拉伯文化艺术人才来华研修。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　成立中阿合作论坛，是我们着眼中阿关系长远发展作出的战略抉择。经过10年发展，论坛已经成为丰富中阿关系战略内涵、推进中阿务实合作的有效抓手。共建“一带一路”是论坛发展的新机遇新起点。抓住这个机遇，才能确保现在的发展不停步，将来的发展可持续。站在这个新起点上，才能获得更大发展空间，才能激发更为持久的发展动力。一言以蔽之，论坛建设要走在实处，当好支点。, 　　——我们要依托论坛支点，加强政策沟通。我们应该彼此坦诚相待，不惧怕分歧、不回避问题，就各自外交政策和发展战略进行充分交流，增进政治互信，促进战略对接，为中阿合作提供政策助力。, 　　——我们要依托论坛支点，深化务实合作。中阿发展禀赋互补性强，我们要充分用好资源共享的潜力和取长补短的空间，用最明白的语言对话，用最贴心的方式合作。集体合作不追求轰动一时，而更看重打基础、谋长远的举措。, 　　——我们要依托论坛支点，不断开拓创新。论坛的生命力在于创新。我们双方要运用新思路、推出新举措、创建新机制，努力破解务实合作遇到的各种难题，以改革创新精神打破现实瓶颈、释放合作潜能。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中阿关系的快速发展，也把双方普通人的命运更加紧密地联结在一起。在我曾经工作过的浙江，就有这样一个故事。在阿拉伯商人云集的义乌市，一位名叫穆罕奈德的约旦商人开了一家地道的阿拉伯餐馆。他把原汁原味的阿拉伯饮食文化带到了义乌，也在义乌的繁荣兴旺中收获了事业成功，最终同中国姑娘喜结连理，把根扎在了中国。一个普通阿拉伯青年人，把自己的人生梦想融入中国百姓追求幸福的中国梦中，执着奋斗，演绎了出彩人生，也诠释了中国梦和阿拉伯梦的完美结合。, 　　中华民族和阿拉伯民族创造了灿烂辉煌的文明，近代以来又都在时代变迁中经历过曲折，实现民族复兴始终是我们双方的追求。让我们携起手来，弘扬丝路精神，深化中阿合作，为中国梦和阿拉伯振兴而努力！为人类和平与发展的崇高事业而奋斗！, 　　舒克拉！谢谢！, 　　（新华社北京6月5日电）, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2014年06月06日 02 版）, ]",习近平：弘扬丝路精神 深化中阿合作,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25110795
25,123,"[, Ladies and Gentlemen, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Friends: Thanks to the Special Representative of the President of Turkey, Foreign Minister Davutoglu, for his statement. On the occasion of China's presidency of AsiaInfo, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all parties, especially Kazakhstan, the initiator of AsiaInfo, and Turkey, the previous chairmanship, to China for their trust and support! , Now, I am speaking on behalf of the People’s Republic of China. Today, leaders and representatives of 47 countries and international organizations, including AsiaInfo member states, observers, and guests of the summit, gathered in Shanghai. Everyone focused on ""strengthening dialogue, trust, and collaboration, and building a new Asia of peace, stability, and cooperation."" On this theme, discussing security cooperation plans, seeking long-term security and good policies, and promoting development and prosperity together have great significance and far-reaching implications for the security of Asia and the world. Today’s Asia, with 67% of the world’s population and one-third of the total economy, is a place where many civilizations and nations converge. Peaceful development in Asia is closely related to the future and destiny of mankind. Stability in Asia is a blessing for world peace, and revitalization in Asia is a blessing for world development. In Asia today, despite the increased risks and challenges, it is still the region with the most development vitality and potential in the world. Peace, development, cooperation, and win-win situation have always been the mainstream of the regional situation. It is also a regional country to handle differences and disputes through consultation and negotiation. Main policy orientation. Asia's position in the overall global strategic situation is rising, and it is playing an increasingly important role in the process of world multipolarization and the democratization of international relations. The good situation in Asia is hard-won and deserves to be cherished. In today's Asia, regional economic cooperation is on the rise, security cooperation is facing difficulties, various cooperation mechanisms are more active, and the regional security cooperation process is at a critical stage of succession and succession. , ""The bright ones change with the times, and the intelligent ones follow the rules."" The situation is developing and the times are improving. To keep up with the advancement of the times, it is impossible for the body to enter the 21st century, and the head still stays in the old era of cold war thinking and zero-sum game. We believe that we should actively advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asian security concept, innovate security concepts, build a new framework for regional security and cooperation, and strive to embark on a road of Asian security that is jointly built, shared and win-win. , Common is to respect and guarantee the security of every country. The diversity of Asia is outstanding. The size, wealth, strength, and weakness of countries are very different. Historical and cultural traditions and social systems are very different. Security interests and demands are also diverse. Everyone lives together in this big garden of Asia, where the interests are intermingled, the security is shared, and it is increasingly becoming a community of shared destiny with both glory and loss. , Security should be universal. It is impossible for one country to be safe and other countries to be unsafe, some countries to be safe and others to be unsafe, not to mention the security of other countries in pursuit of their so-called absolute security. Otherwise, as the Kazakh proverb puts it: ""Blowing out other people's lights will burn out your beard."" Security should be equal. All countries have equal rights to participate in regional security affairs, and all have the responsibility to maintain regional security. No country should seek to monopolize regional security affairs and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries. , Security should be inclusive. The diversity of Asia and the differences of countries should be transformed into vitality and impetus to promote regional security cooperation, abide by the basic principles of international relations such as respect for sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and respect for the social system and development path independently chosen by each country , Respect and take care of the reasonable security concerns of all parties. Strengthening the military alliance against third parties is not conducive to maintaining regional common security. Comprehensive means to maintain the security of traditional and non-traditional fields as a whole. Asia’s security issues are extremely complex, with both hot and sensitive issues and ethnic and religious conflicts. The challenges posed by terrorism, transnational crime, environmental security, cyber security, energy and resource security, and major natural disasters have increased significantly. Traditional security threats and non-traditional Security threats are intertwined, and the connotation and extension of security issues are being further expanded. Therefore, we should consider the historical latitude and longitude and the actual situation of Asian security issues in a holistic manner, take a multi-pronged approach, take comprehensive measures, and coordinate and promote regional security governance. It is necessary to focus on solving the current outstanding regional security problems, but also to plan how to deal with various potential security threats, to avoid headaches and pains. For the ""three forces"" of terrorism, separatism, and extremism, we must adopt a zero-tolerance attitude, strengthen international and regional cooperation, and intensify crackdown efforts so that people in the region can live happily in peaceful and peaceful lands. , Cooperation is to promote the security of countries and the region through dialogue and cooperation. There is a proverb that puts it well: ""Strength is not on the arm, but on unity."" Through frank and in-depth dialogueThrough dialogue and cooperation to promote security in all countries and the region. There is a well-known saying: ""Strength is not on the arm, but on unity."" Through frank and in-depth dialogue and communication, strategic mutual trust should be enhanced, mutual suspicion reduced, mutual assimilation and harmonious coexistence. We must focus on the common security interests of all countries, start with low-sensitivity areas, actively cultivate the awareness of cooperation to meet security challenges, continuously expand cooperation areas, innovate cooperation methods, seek peace through cooperation, and promote security through cooperation. We must persist in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, oppose the use of force or threat of force at all times, oppose provoking incidents and intensify contradictions for one's own self, oppose the use of neighbors as a betrayal, and harm others. In the final analysis, things in Asia depend on the Asian people. In the final analysis, problems in Asia depend on the Asian people. In the final analysis, Asian security depends on the Asian people. The Asian people have the ability and wisdom to achieve peace and stability in Asia through enhanced cooperation. , Asia is an open Asia. While strengthening their own cooperation, Asian countries should be firmly committed to cooperation with countries in other regions, other regions, and international organizations. All parties are welcome to play an active and constructive role in Asian security and cooperation, and strive to achieve a win-win, multi-win, and win-win situation. . , Sustainability means that both development and security are emphasized to achieve lasting security. ""The elders who seek wood must fix their roots; those who desire far away must dredge their springs."" Development is the foundation of security, and security is the condition of development. Peaceful trees cannot grow on the barren land, and the fruits of development cannot be borne in the flames of the sky. For most Asian countries, development is the greatest security, and it is also the ""master key"" to solving regional security problems. To build an Asian security building that can stand the test of wind and rain, we should focus on the development theme, actively improve people's livelihood, narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, and constantly lay a solid foundation for security. It is necessary to promote the process of common development and regional integration, and strive to form a good situation in which regional economic cooperation and security cooperation interact positively and go hand in hand, and promote sustainable security through sustainable development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! AsiaInfo is the regional security forum with the largest coverage, the largest number of members and the most representative representation in Asia. For more than 20 years, AsiaInfo has made its mission of enhancing mutual trust and cooperation and promoting security and stability in Asia, adhering to the principle of consensus, and making important contributions to deepening understanding, building consensus, and deepening cooperation. At present, the Asian people's desire for peace and stability is more intense, and the demand for joining hands to meet security challenges is more urgent. The Chinese side proposes to promote AsiaInfo as a platform for security dialogue and cooperation covering all of Asia, and on this basis, explore the establishment of a new framework for regional security cooperation. China believes that it can consider appropriately increasing the frequency of the AsiaInfo Foreign Ministers' Meeting and even the summit according to the needs of the development of the situation, so as to strengthen the political guidance of AsiaInfo and plan the development blueprint of AsiaInfo. , China proposes to strengthen AsiaInfo's capacity and mechanism building, support and improve the functions of the AsiaInfo Secretariat, establish a defense consultation mechanism for member countries and a working group on the implementation of supervision measures on trust measures in various fields within the framework of AsiaInfo, and deepen counter-terrorism, economic and trade, tourism, environmental protection, humanities, etc. Exchange and cooperation in the field. , The Chinese side proposes to establish a non-governmental exchange network among all parties of AsiaInfo by organizing the AsiaInfo Non-Government Forum, and lay a solid social foundation for the widespread dissemination of AsiaInfo’s security concepts, enhancing AsiaInfo’s influence, and promoting regional security governance. The Chinese side proposes that to enhance AsiaInfo’s inclusiveness and openness, it is necessary to strengthen coordination and cooperation with other cooperative organizations in the region, as well as to expand dialogue and communication with other regions and relevant international organizations to jointly contribute to the maintenance of regional peace and stability. . , China will fulfill its responsibilities as chairman of AsiaInfo, work with all parties to further enhance AsiaInfo's status and role, and work together to create a new situation in Asian security cooperation. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! China has always been a staunch force for maintaining regional and world peace and promoting common development. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly promoted by China, India and Myanmar have increasingly become the basic guidelines guiding relations between countries. China has always been committed to peacefully handling disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests with relevant countries, and has resolved the land border issue thoroughly through friendly consultations with 12 of the 14 neighboring countries. China actively participates in regional security cooperation, initiates the establishment of a Shanghai Cooperation Organization with relevant countries, advocates a new security concept of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, and collaboration, and supports ASEAN, SAARC, and the Arab League to play an active role in regional affairs. China and Russia jointly proposed the Asia-Pacific Security and Cooperation Initiative, which plays an important role in consolidating and maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China promotes the six-party talks process, supports the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan, and makes unremitting efforts to resolve international and regional hot issues through dialogue and negotiation. China has cooperated with countries in the region and the international community in coping with the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis, and has made due contributions to promoting regional and world economic growth. , China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and has always pursued a mutually beneficial and win-win developmentOpportunity to make due contributions to promoting regional and world economic growth. , China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development. It has always pursued an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win progress, and has developed friendly cooperation with countries around the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China's peaceful development began in Asia, relying on Asia, and benefiting Asia. , ""We are close to each other, good neighbors, good neighbors."" China insists on being good neighbors, taking neighbors as partners, adhering to good neighborliness, peaceful neighborliness, and rich neighborliness, practicing the concepts of pro, honesty, benefit, and tolerance, and striving to improve its own development. Good for Asian countries. China will work with other countries to accelerate the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, start the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as soon as possible, participate more deeply in the regional cooperation process, and promote the mutual development and complementarity of Asian development and security. , ""The mountains are tall and the mountains are long."" China is an active advocate of the Asian security concept and a firm practitioner. China will step by step to strengthen security dialogue and cooperation with all parties, and jointly discuss the formulation of regional security codes of conduct and the Asian Security Partnership Program, so that Asian countries can become good partners of mutual trust and equal cooperation. China is willing to establish a normalized exchange and cooperation mechanism with regional countries to jointly combat the ""three forces""; discuss the establishment of the Asian Law Enforcement Security Cooperation Forum and the Asian Security Emergency Response Center, etc., to deepen law enforcement security cooperation, and coordinate regional countries to better respond to major emergencies. China proposes to promote the exchanges and mutual learning of different civilizations and different religions, learn from each other's weaknesses and make common progress through convening the Asian Civilization Dialogue Conference. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Chinese people are working hard to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At the same time, they are willing to support and help the people of all Asian countries to realize their beautiful dreams, and work with all parties to achieve the Asian dream of lasting peace and common development. The lofty cause makes new and greater contributions! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 21st), ""People's Daily"" (May 22, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Actively establish the Asian security concept and create a new situation in security cooperation,3600,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-05-22,"[, 各位来宾，各位同事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 感谢土耳其总统特别代表达武特奥卢外长刚才的发言。值此中方担任亚信主席国之际，我谨对各方特别是亚信倡议国哈萨克斯坦和前任主席国土耳其给予中方的信任和支持，表示衷心的感谢！, 现在，我代表中华人民共和国发言。, 今天，包括亚信成员国、观察员、峰会客人在内的47个国家和国际组织的领导人及代表相聚上海，大家围绕“加强对话、信任与协作，共建和平、稳定与合作的新亚洲”这一主题，共商安全合作大计，共谋长治久安良策，共襄发展繁荣盛举，对亚洲和世界安全都意义重大、影响深远。, 今天的亚洲，拥有全世界67%的人口和三分之一的经济总量，是众多文明、民族的汇聚交融之地。亚洲和平发展同人类前途命运息息相关，亚洲稳定是世界和平之幸，亚洲振兴是世界发展之福。, 今天的亚洲，虽然面临的风险和挑战增多，但依然是世界上最具发展活力和潜力的地区，和平、发展、合作、共赢始终是地区形势主流，通过协商谈判处理分歧争端也是地区国家主要政策取向。亚洲在世界战略全局中的地位不断上升，在世界多极化、国际关系民主化进程中发挥着越来越重要的作用。亚洲良好局面来之不易，值得倍加珍惜。, 今天的亚洲，区域经济合作方兴未艾，安全合作正在迎难而上，各种合作机制更加活跃，地区安全合作进程正处在承前启后的关键阶段。, “明者因时而变，知者随事而制。”形势在发展，时代在进步。要跟上时代前进步伐，就不能身体已进入21世纪，而脑袋还停留在冷战思维、零和博弈的旧时代。我们认为，应该积极倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，创新安全理念，搭建地区安全和合作新架构，努力走出一条共建、共享、共赢的亚洲安全之路。, 共同，就是要尊重和保障每一个国家安全。亚洲多样性特点突出，各国大小、贫富、强弱很不相同，历史文化传统和社会制度千差万别，安全利益和诉求也多种多样。大家共同生活在亚洲这个大家园里，利益交融、安危与共，日益成为一荣俱荣、一损俱损的命运共同体。, 安全应该是普遍的。不能一个国家安全而其他国家不安全，一部分国家安全而另一部分国家不安全，更不能牺牲别国安全谋求自身所谓绝对安全。否则，就会像哈萨克斯坦谚语说的那样：“吹灭别人的灯，会烧掉自己的胡子。”, 安全应该是平等的。各国都有平等参与地区安全事务的权利，也都有维护地区安全的责任。任何国家都不应该谋求垄断地区安全事务，侵害其他国家正当权益。, 安全应该是包容的。应该把亚洲多样性和各国的差异性转化为促进地区安全合作的活力和动力，恪守尊重主权、独立和领土完整、互不干涉内政等国际关系基本准则，尊重各国自主选择的社会制度和发展道路，尊重并照顾各方合理安全关切。强化针对第三方的军事同盟不利于维护地区共同安全。, 综合，就是要统筹维护传统领域和非传统领域安全。亚洲安全问题极为复杂，既有热点敏感问题又有民族宗教矛盾，恐怖主义、跨国犯罪、环境安全、网络安全、能源资源安全、重大自然灾害等带来的挑战明显上升，传统安全威胁和非传统安全威胁相互交织，安全问题的内涵和外延都在进一步拓展。, 我们应该通盘考虑亚洲安全问题的历史经纬和现实状况，多管齐下、综合施策，协调推进地区安全治理。既要着力解决当前突出的地区安全问题，又要统筹谋划如何应对各类潜在的安全威胁，避免头痛医头、脚痛医脚。, 对恐怖主义、分裂主义、极端主义这“三股势力”，必须采取零容忍态度，加强国际和地区合作，加大打击力度，使本地区人民都能够在安宁祥和的土地上幸福生活。, 合作，就是要通过对话合作促进各国和本地区安全。有句谚语说得好：“力量不在胳膊上，而在团结上。”要通过坦诚深入的对话沟通，增进战略互信，减少相互猜疑，求同化异、和睦相处。要着眼各国共同安全利益，从低敏感领域入手，积极培育合作应对安全挑战的意识，不断扩大合作领域、创新合作方式，以合作谋和平、以合作促安全。要坚持以和平方式解决争端，反对动辄使用武力或以武力相威胁，反对为一己之私挑起事端、激化矛盾，反对以邻为壑、损人利己。, 亚洲的事情归根结底要靠亚洲人民来办，亚洲的问题归根结底要靠亚洲人民来处理，亚洲的安全归根结底要靠亚洲人民来维护。亚洲人民有能力、有智慧通过加强合作来实现亚洲和平稳定。, 亚洲是开放的亚洲。亚洲国家在加强自身合作的同时，要坚定致力于同其他地区国家、其他地区和国际组织的合作，欢迎各方为亚洲安全和合作发挥积极和建设性作用，努力实现双赢、多赢、共赢。, 可持续，就是要发展和安全并重以实现持久安全。“求木之长者，必固其根本；欲流之远者，必浚其泉源。”发展是安全的基础，安全是发展的条件。贫瘠的土地上长不成和平的大树，连天的烽火中结不出发展的硕果。对亚洲大多数国家来说，发展就是最大安全，也是解决地区安全问题的“总钥匙”。, 要建造经得起风雨考验的亚洲安全大厦，就应该聚焦发展主题，积极改善民生，缩小贫富差距，不断夯实安全的根基。要推动共同发展和区域一体化进程，努力形成区域经济合作和安全合作良性互动、齐头并进的大好局面，以可持续发展促进可持续安全。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 亚信是亚洲覆盖范围最大、成员数量最多、代表性最广的地区安全论坛。20多年来，亚信以增进互信协作、促进亚洲安全稳定为己任，秉持协商一致原则，为加深理解、凝聚共识、深化合作作出了重要贡献。, 当前，亚洲人民对和平稳定的渴望更加强烈，对携手应对安全挑战的需求更加迫切。, 中方建议，推动亚信成为覆盖全亚洲的安全对话合作平台，并在此基础上探讨建立地区安全合作新架构。中方认为，可以考虑根据形势发展需要，适当增加亚信外长会乃至峰会频率，以加强对亚信的政治引领，规划好亚信发展蓝图。, 中方建议，加强亚信能力和机制建设，支持完善亚信秘书处职能，在亚信框架内建立成员国防务磋商机制及各领域信任措施落实监督行动工作组，深化反恐、经贸、旅游、环保、人文等领域交流合作。, 中方建议，通过举办亚信非政府论坛等方式，建立亚信各方民间交流网络，为广泛传播亚信安全理念、提升亚信影响力、推进地区安全治理奠定坚实社会基础。, 中方建议，增强亚信的包容性和开放性，既要加强同本地区其他合作组织的协调和合作，也要扩大同其他地区和有关国际组织的对话和沟通，共同为维护地区和平稳定作出贡献。, 中国将履行亚信主席国职责，同各方一道，进一步提升亚信地位和作用，携手开创亚洲安全合作新局面。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国始终是维护地区和世界和平、促进共同发展的坚定力量。中国同印度、缅甸共同倡导的和平共处五项原则，日益成为指导国家间关系的基本准则。中国一贯致力于通过和平方式处理同有关国家的领土主权和海洋权益争端，已经通过友好协商同14个邻国中的12个国家彻底解决了陆地边界问题。中国积极参与地区安全合作，同有关国家发起成立上海合作组织，倡导互信、互利、平等、协作的新安全观，支持东盟、南盟、阿盟等在地区事务中发挥积极作用。中国同俄罗斯共同提出亚太安全与合作倡议，为巩固和维护亚太地区和平稳定发挥重要作用。中国推动六方会谈进程，支持阿富汗和平重建，为通过对话谈判解决国际和地区热点问题而不懈努力。中国同地区国家和国际社会合作应对亚洲金融危机和国际金融危机，为促进地区和世界经济增长作出了应有贡献。, 中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，始终不渝奉行互利共赢的开放战略，在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同世界各国友好合作。中国和平发展始于亚洲、依托亚洲、造福亚洲。, “亲望亲好，邻望邻好。”中国坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴，坚持睦邻、安邻、富邻，践行亲、诚、惠、容理念，努力使自身发展更好惠及亚洲国家。中国将同各国一道，加快推进丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路建设，尽早启动亚洲基础设施投资银行，更加深入参与区域合作进程，推动亚洲发展和安全相互促进、相得益彰。, “山积而高，泽积而长。”中国是亚洲安全观的积极倡导者，也是坚定实践者。中方将一步一个脚印加强同各方的安全对话和合作，共同探讨制定地区安全行为准则和亚洲安全伙伴计划，使亚洲国家成为相互信任、平等合作的好伙伴。中方愿意同地区国家建立常态化交流合作机制，共同打击“三股势力”；探讨建立亚洲执法安全合作论坛、亚洲安全应急中心等，深化执法安全合作，协调地区国家更好应对重大突发安全事件。中方倡议通过召开亚洲文明对话大会等方式，推动不同文明、不同宗教交流互鉴、取长补短、共同进步。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国人民正在努力实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，同时愿意支持和帮助亚洲各国人民实现各自的美好梦想，同各方一道努力实现持久和平、共同发展的亚洲梦，为促进人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社上海5月21日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年05月22日 02 版）, ]",习近平：积极树立亚洲安全观 共创安全合作新局面,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25048467
26,124,"[, Dear President Weizzek, Dear Former Prime Minister Schmidt, Dear Vice-Chairman Weimar,, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Guttak! Hello everyone! I am very pleased to meet you at the invitation of the former President Weizzek and the Colber Foundation. First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Colber Foundation for its efforts and contributions in promoting mutual understanding and understanding between China and Europe! , 5 years ago, I visited your country. At that time, the impact of the international financial crisis was still fermenting, the European debt problem was beginning to emerge, and the global economy was shrouded in anxiety. During that visit, China and Germany decided to promote cooperation in various fields to a higher level, and to overcome difficulties through practical actions. 5 years later, I am happy to see that Europe has made positive progress in responding to the issue of sovereign debt, and there are clear signs of economic recovery. Germany has played a key role as a promoter of European economic ""stability anchor"" and European integration, and has won praise from the international community. We are glad that China has cooperated with Germany and Europe to cope with the results of the international financial crisis. At present, China-Germany relations are at the best period in history, and the breadth, depth, and popularity of bilateral exchanges and cooperation have reached unprecedented levels. Facts have proved that the complementary advantages and common development of China and Germany can not only benefit the two countries and peoples, but also play an important role in promoting world peace and development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Why is there such a good situation in the exchange and cooperation between China and Germany? In my opinion, an important factor is that after long-term efforts of both sides, countries that understand different historical cultures, different national conditions, and different social systems should understand and treat each other sincerely, be good at listening to each other's opinions, and think about issues from the other's perspective. , Mutual understanding and mutual understanding are basic projects to promote the development of national relations. The more you understand and the deeper your understanding, the stronger and broader the foundation for exchanges and cooperation. As we all know, after more than 30 years of rapid development through reform and opening up, China's economic aggregate has ranked second in the world. Faced with the growing size of China, some people began to worry, and some people always looked at China with colored glasses, thinking that China's development must be a ""threat"", and even described China as a terrible ""Murphy"" ""Stowe"", it seems that one day China will ingest the soul of the world. Although this kind of argument is like a fantasy, it is a pity that some people are happy about it. This can only prove once again the truth: prejudice is often the most difficult to eliminate. Throughout the history of mankind, it is not the mountains and rivers that separate people from the sea and the deep seas, but the barrier of mutual understanding. Leibniz said that only by exchanging our respective abilities can we light up our wisdom. Taking this opportunity, I would like to talk about China’s reform and development on the theme of China’s adherence to the path of peaceful development. I hope it will help to increase your understanding and understanding of China. , China has long solemnly declared to the world: China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development. It not only develops itself through maintaining world peace, but also maintains world peace through its own development. Taking the path of peaceful development is China's response to the international community's focus on China's development trend, and it is also the Chinese people's self-confidence and consciousness to achieve their own development goals. This self-confidence and consciousness stems from the profound origins of Chinese civilization, from the recognition of the conditions for achieving China's development goals, from the grasp of the world's development trend. The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation. The deepest spiritual pursuit of a nation must be genetically sequenced in the national spirit that it has passed on. The Chinese civilization with a history of more than 5,000 years has always advocated peace. The pursuit of peace, harmony and harmony is deeply rooted in the spiritual world of the Chinese nation and deeply dissolved in the blood of the Chinese people. Since ancient times, China has put forward the motto ""Although the country is big, the belligerent will die"". Ideas such as ""Harmony is precious"", ""Harmony is different"", ""Turn dryness into jade silk"", ""Guotai People's Security"", ""Good Neighborly Friendship"", ""World Peace"", ""World Harmony"" and other ideas are handed down from generation to generation. China has been one of the most powerful countries in the world for a long time, but it has no record of colonizing and invading other countries. Our insistence on taking the path of peaceful development is the inheritance and development of the Chinese nation's peace-loving cultural tradition for thousands of years. China has set its future development goals, which is to double its GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents by 2020 compared with 2010, and to build a well-off society in an all-round way, and to build a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. There are more than 1.3 billion people in China, onlyHarmonious socialist modern country. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. There are more than 1.3 billion people in China. As long as the road is correct, the overall wealth level and happiness index can rise rapidly, but it is not easy to increase the wealth level and happiness index of each individual. The same table meal, even if it is rich, 8 people eat is completely different from 80 people and 800 people. We are well aware that for a long period of time, China is still the largest developing country in the world, and raising the living standards and quality of more than 1.3 billion people requires hard work. To concentrate on construction, China needs two basic conditions, one is a harmonious and stable domestic environment, and the other is a peaceful and peaceful international environment. History is the best teacher. It faithfully records the footprint of each country, and also provides inspiration for the future development of each country. From the Opium War of 1840 to the founding of New China in 1949, there have been frequent wars in the Chinese society and constant wars of war. The internal wars and the cycle of invasion by foreign enemies have brought unbearable suffering to the Chinese people. The war of aggression against China launched by Japanese militarism alone has caused a human tragedy of more than 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians. This tragic history has left an unforgettable memory for the Chinese. Chinese people have always said ""do not do what you want, don't do it to others."" China needs peace, just as people need air, just as everything needs sunlight. Only by sticking to the path of peaceful development and maintaining world peace with all countries in the world can China achieve its goals and make greater contributions to the world. , Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution, said: ""The trend of the world is magnificent, prosperity is prosperity, and converseness is prosperity."" History tells us that for a country to develop and prosper, it must grasp and follow the trend of world development. Abandoned by history. What is the trend in today's world? There is only one answer, that is peace, development, cooperation and win-win. China does not agree with the old logic of ""national power must be hegemony."" In today's world, can the old path of colonialism and hegemonism still work? the answer is negative. Not only can't get through, but it will definitely hit the head and bleed. Only the path of peaceful development can work. Therefore, China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development. , Facts speak louder than words. For decades, China has always adhered to an independent foreign policy of peace and has always emphasized that the purpose of China’s foreign policy is to maintain world peace and promote common development. China has publicly stated many times that China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics, does not interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, never seeks hegemony, and never engages in expansion. This is what we stipulate in policies, and we design it in systems, and we always do it in practice. Of course, China will unswervingly safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests, and no country should expect us to swallow the bitter fruits that undermine China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. In short, China’s peaceful development is not an expedient measure, nor a diplomatic rhetoric, but a conclusion drawn from the objective judgment of history, reality, and the future. It is an organic unity of self-confidence and practical consciousness. The path of peaceful development is good for China and the world. We can’t think of any reason not to stick to this path that has been proved to be feasible in practice. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In November last year, the Communist Party of China convened the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It made a top-level design for China's future reform and opening up, and proposed a road map and timetable for reform. Our overall goal is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, Promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, and lay a better institutional foundation for China's long-term development. , China is accelerating new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, which will stimulate huge investment and consumer demand. China's GDP per capita is close to US$7,000, and it has entered a period of rapid upgrading of residents' consumption structure and industrial structure. In 2013, the proportion of China's service industry exceeded that of industrial manufacturing for the first time. The proportion and status of China's service industry will continue to increase, the proportion of high value-added and high-tech industries will continue to rise, and new consumer hot spots and economic growth points will continue to emerge. In the next five years, China is expected to import more than US$10 trillion in commodities, and the cumulative scale of foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and there will be more than 500 million outbound tourism. , The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said: ""The big nations are inferior."" That is to say, big countries should have the mind to hold all the rivers in the world like they live in the lower reaches of rivers. China is willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the outside world with an open and inclusive attitude, and listen to the world with an open mind. We look forward to the time when we can eliminate all kinds of prejudices and misunderstandings, and we also look forward to the outside world to observe China more objectively, historically, and multi-dimensionally, and truly understand a comprehensive, true, and three-dimensional China. , China’s development will never be sacrificedWe can observe China with more objective, historical and multi-dimensional perspectives, and truly understand a comprehensive, true and three-dimensional China. China's development will never come at the expense of the interests of other countries. We will never do anything that harms others and self-interest. We will proceed from the general meaning of world peace and development, contribute to the wisdom of China in dealing with contemporary international relations, contribute to the Chinese plan to improve global governance, and make our own contributions to the human society in responding to the challenges of the 21st century. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Chinese nation and the German nation are two great nations and have made significant contributions to the progress of human civilization. Germany is not only famous in the world for its developed science and technology and modern manufacturing, but also has born many world-renowned giants in the fields of philosophy, literature, music, etc. Many of their works have long been known to the Chinese people. Among these works are Goethe, Schiller, Heine and other literary masterpieces and immortal poems, and Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx, Heidegger, Marcuse and others Philosophical debates include the beautiful melody of Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms and others. Many Chinese readers, including myself, have enjoyed their works, felt the power of thought, and deepened their understanding of the world and life. The Germans say that mountains and mountains do not meet, people need to meet. The Chinese people and the German people have a long history of exchanges and profound friendship. At this moment, I couldn't help but think of a German friend whom the Chinese people love, he is Rabe. More than 70 years ago, Japanese militarism invaded Nanjing, China, and created the brutal bloody massacre of more than 300,000 Chinese military and civilians. At that critical juncture, Rabe contacted a dozen other foreigners in China and set up a ""Nanjing Security Zone"" to provide shelter for more than 200,000 Chinese. Rabe recorded the inside story of the Holocaust in detail in his diary, which became an important evidence to study this history. In 1996, the Rabe Memorial Hall jointly established by China and Germany opened in Nanjing. At the end of last year, the restoration of the Labe Cemetery built by Nanjing City was completed. The Chinese people commemorate Rabe because he has a great love for life and a pursuit of peace. , Another German friend named Noble, a German grape expert, he and his assistant Hans came to Zaozhuang, Shandong, China 17 times from 2000 to 2009 to teach local farmers the techniques of viticulture, grafting and improvement, which will be passed down for hundreds of years. The family's trademark is granted free of charge to local wineries. Noble and Hans sponsored 8 local families with financial difficulties to go to school. In 2007, when Hans suddenly suffered from cancer, he still remembered that the two students he sponsored had not finished high school, and asked Tonobo to give them a 2,000 yuan grant. On August 1, 2008, when Noble handed over the money to the children, everyone present moved to tears. , These are just two touching fragments of friendship between the people of China and Germany. For a long time, many German friends have made important contributions to the development of Sino-German relations and China's reform and opening up. The 21st century is a century of cooperation. As wide as your mind, there are as many cooperation stages as possible. The next 5 to 10 years will be a crucial period for reform and development for China and Germany. As the reform process deepens, the cooperation between the two countries will show more fit and continue to gain new impetus. I believe that when ""Made in Germany"" and ""Made in China"" cooperate hand in hand, we will not only manufacture high-quality products, but also the happiness and ideals of the two peoples. As the two most important economies in Asia and Europe, the Sino-German economy has strengthened its integration and achieved a strong combination of economic growth in Asia and Europe, which will definitely have a positive impact on the world economy. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! This year is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. German writer Lessing said that history should not be a burden of memory, but a sensible enlightenment. Brandt, the former prime minister of your country, once said: ""Whoever forgets history will be ill in the soul."" The Chinese said that the former should not be forgotten, the teacher of the latter. The Chinese people have formed a conscious choice to take the path of peaceful development from their own experiences. We sincerely hope that all countries in the world will follow the path of peaceful development and work together to build a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 28th), ""People's Daily"" (March 30, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the German Colber Foundation (full text),4334,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-03-30,"[, 尊敬的魏茨泽克前总统，, 尊敬的施密特前总理，, 尊敬的魏迈尔副主席，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 古腾塔克！大家好！我很高兴应魏茨泽克前总统和科尔伯基金会的邀请，与大家见面。首先，我谨对科尔伯基金会在促进中欧相互了解和理解方面作出的努力和贡献，表示诚挚的谢意！, 5年前，我曾访问过贵国。当时，国际金融危机影响还在发酵，欧债问题初露端倪，全球经济笼罩在一片不安之中，颇有“黑云压城城欲摧”之感。那次访问期间，中德决定推动各领域合作向更高层次迈进，以实际行动共克时艰。, 5年后，我高兴地看到，欧洲在应对主权债务问题上取得了积极进展，经济复苏迹象明显。德国作为欧洲经济“稳定锚”和欧洲一体化的推动者，发挥了关键作用，赢得了国际社会赞誉。我们为中国同德国和欧洲合作应对国际金融危机冲击取得的成果感到高兴。, 当前，中德关系正处在历史最好时期，双方交流合作的广度、深度、热度都达到了前所未有的水平。事实证明，中德实现优势互补、共同发展，不仅可以造福两国和两国人民，而且可以为世界和平与发展发挥重要促进作用。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 为什么中德两国交流合作能出现这样的好局面？我认为，一个重要因素就是经过双方长期努力，懂得了不同历史文化、不同国情、不同社会制度的国家要相互理解、真诚相待，善于倾听对方意见，设身处地从对方的角度思考问题。, 相互了解、相互理解是促进国家关系发展的基础性工程。了解越多，理解越深，交流合作的基础就越牢固、越广泛。, 众所周知，经过改革开放30多年的快速发展，中国经济总量已经位居世界第二。面对中国的块头不断长大，有些人开始担心，也有一些人总是戴着有色眼镜看中国，认为中国发展起来了必然是一种“威胁”，甚至把中国描绘成一个可怕的“墨菲斯托”，似乎哪一天中国就要摄取世界的灵魂。尽管这种论调像天方夜谭一样，但遗憾的是，一些人对此却乐此不疲。这只能再次证明了一条真理：偏见往往最难消除。, 纵观人类历史，把人们隔离开来的往往不是千山万水，不是大海深壑，而是人们相互认知上的隔膜。莱布尼茨说，唯有相互交流我们各自的才能，才能共同点燃我们的智慧之灯。, 借此机会，我想以中国坚持走和平发展道路为题，就中国改革发展谈点体会，希望有助于增进大家对中国的了解和理解。, 中国早就向世界郑重宣示：中国坚定不移走和平发展道路，既通过维护世界和平发展自己，又通过自身发展维护世界和平。走和平发展道路，是中国对国际社会关注中国发展走向的回应，更是中国人民对实现自身发展目标的自信和自觉。这种自信和自觉，来源于中华文明的深厚渊源，来源于对实现中国发展目标条件的认知，来源于对世界发展大势的把握。, 中华民族是爱好和平的民族。一个民族最深沉的精神追求，一定要在其薪火相传的民族精神中来进行基因测序。有着5000多年历史的中华文明，始终崇尚和平，和平、和睦、和谐的追求深深植根于中华民族的精神世界之中，深深溶化在中国人民的血脉之中。中国自古就提出了“国虽大，好战必亡”的箴言。“以和为贵”、“和而不同”、“化干戈为玉帛”、“国泰民安”、“睦邻友邦”、“天下太平”、“天下大同”等理念世代相传。中国历史上曾经长期是世界上最强大的国家之一，但没有留下殖民和侵略他国的记录。我们坚持走和平发展道路，是对几千年来中华民族热爱和平的文化传统的继承和发扬。, 中国已经确定了未来发展目标，这就是到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番、全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。我们形象地把这个目标概括为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。中国有13亿多人，只要道路正确，整体的财富水平和幸福指数可以迅速上升，但每个个体的财富水平和幸福指数的提高就不那么容易了。同样一桌饭，即使再丰盛，8个人吃和80个人吃、800个人吃是完全不一样的。我们深知，在相当长时期内，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家，提高13亿多人的生活水平和质量需要我们付出艰苦的努力。中国要聚精会神搞建设，需要两个基本条件，一个是和谐稳定的国内环境，一个是和平安宁的国际环境。, 历史是最好的老师，它忠实记录下每一个国家走过的足迹，也给每一个国家未来的发展提供启示。从1840年鸦片战争到1949年新中国成立的100多年间，中国社会战火频频、兵燹不断，内部战乱和外敌入侵循环发生，给中国人民带来了不堪回首的苦难。仅日本军国主义发动的侵华战争，就造成了中国军民伤亡3500多万人的人间惨剧。这段悲惨的历史，给中国人留下了刻骨铭心的记忆。中国人历来讲求“己所不欲，勿施于人”。中国需要和平，就像人需要空气一样，就像万物生长需要阳光一样。只有坚持走和平发展道路，只有同世界各国一道维护世界和平，中国才能实现自己的目标，才能为世界作出更大贡献。, 中国民主革命的先行者孙中山先生说：“世界潮流，浩浩荡荡，顺之则昌，逆之则亡。”历史告诉我们，一个国家要发展繁荣，必须把握和顺应世界发展大势，反之必然会被历史抛弃。什么是当今世界的潮流？答案只有一个，那就是和平、发展、合作、共赢。中国不认同“国强必霸”的陈旧逻辑。当今世界，殖民主义、霸权主义的老路还能走得通吗？答案是否定的。不仅走不通，而且一定会碰得头破血流。只有和平发展道路可以走得通。所以，中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路。, 事实胜于雄辩。几十年来，中国始终坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，始终强调中国外交政策的宗旨是维护世界和平、促进共同发展。中国多次公开宣示，中国反对各种形式的霸权主义和强权政治，不干涉别国内政，永远不称霸，永远不搞扩张。我们在政策上是这样规定的、制度上是这样设计的，在实践中更是一直这样做的。当然，中国将坚定不移维护自己的主权、安全、发展利益，任何国家都不要指望我们会吞下损害中国主权、安全、发展利益的苦果。, 总之，中国走和平发展道路，不是权宜之计，更不是外交辞令，而是从历史、现实、未来的客观判断中得出的结论，是思想自信和实践自觉的有机统一。和平发展道路对中国有利、对世界有利，我们想不出有任何理由不坚持这条被实践证明是走得通的道路。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 去年11月，中国共产党召开了十八届三中全会，对未来中国改革开放作出了顶层设计，提出了改革的路线图和时间表，我们的总目标是完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度、推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，为中国长远发展奠定更好的制度基础。, 中国正在加快推进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化，将激发巨大的投资和消费需求。中国人均国内生产总值已接近7000美元，进入了居民消费结构和产业结构快速升级的时期。2013年，中国服务业比重首次超过工业制造业。中国服务业比重和地位将继续提高，高附加值和高技术产业比重将不断上升，新的消费热点和经济增长点也将不断涌现。未来5年，中国预计将进口超过10万亿美元的商品，对外投资规模累计将超过5000亿美元，还将有超过5亿人次出境旅游。, 中国先哲老子讲：“大邦者下流。”就是说，大国要像居于江河下游那样，拥有容纳天下百川的胸怀。中国愿意以开放包容心态加强同外界对话和沟通，虚心倾听世界的声音。我们期待时间能够消除各种偏见和误解，也期待外界能够更多以客观、历史、多维的眼光观察中国，真正认识一个全面、真实、立体的中国。, 中国的发展绝不以牺牲别国利益为代价，我们绝不做损人利己、以邻为壑的事情。我们将从世界和平与发展的大义出发，贡献处理当代国际关系的中国智慧，贡献完善全球治理的中国方案，为人类社会应对21世纪的各种挑战作出自己的贡献。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中华民族和德意志民族是两个伟大民族，为人类文明进步作出了重大贡献。德国不仅以其发达的科学技术和现代制造业闻名世界，而且在哲学、文学、音乐等领域诞生许多享誉全球的巨擘，他们的许多作品早已为中国民众所熟知。这些作品中，有歌德、席勒、海涅等人的文学巨著和不朽诗篇，有莱布尼茨、康德、黑格尔、费尔巴哈、马克思、海德格尔、马尔库塞等人的哲学辩论，有巴赫、贝多芬、舒曼、勃拉姆斯等人的优美旋律。包括我本人在内的很多中国读者都从他们的作品中获得愉悦、感受到思想的力量、加深了对世界和人生的认识。, 德国人说，山和山不相遇，人和人要相逢。中国人民同德国人民有着悠久交往历史和深厚友谊。此时此刻，我不由得想起了一位中国人民爱戴的德国友人，他就是拉贝。70多年前，日本军国主义侵入中国南京市，制造了屠杀30多万中国军民的惨绝人寰的血案。在那个危急关头，拉贝联络了其他十几位在华外国人士，设立了“南京安全区”，为20多万中国人提供了栖身之所。拉贝在日记中详细记录了大屠杀内情，成为研究这段历史的重要证据。1996年，中德共同建立的拉贝纪念馆在南京开放。去年底，由南京市建造的拉贝墓园修复工程落成。中国人民纪念拉贝，是因为他对生命有大爱、对和平有追求。, 还有一位德国友人叫诺博，是德国葡萄专家，2000年至2009年间他同助手汉斯17次来到中国山东枣庄，向当地农民传授葡萄栽培、嫁接改优技术，将传承几百年的家族商标无偿授予当地酒厂使用。诺博和汉斯资助了8名当地家庭经济困难学生上学。2007年，汉斯突患癌症，弥留之际仍不忘自己资助的两名学生尚未念完高中，嘱托诺博把2000元助学款带给他们。2008年8月1日，当诺博把钱交到孩子手中时，在场的所有人都感动得潸然泪下。, 这只是中德两国人民友好的两个感人片段。长期以来，众多的德国朋友为中德关系发展、为中国改革开放事业作出了重要贡献。, 21世纪是合作的世纪。心胸有多宽，合作舞台就有多广。未来5年至10年对中德来说都是改革发展的关键时期。随着改革进程的深化，两国合作将呈现更多契合点，不断获得新动力。我相信，当“德国制造”和“中国制造”真诚牵手合作，我们所制造的将不只是高质量的产品，更是两国人民的幸福和理想。作为亚洲和欧洲最主要的两大经济体，中德经济加强融合，实现亚欧两大经济增长极强强联手，定将对世界经济产生积极影响。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 今年是第一次世界大战爆发100周年、第二次世界大战爆发75周年。德国文学家莱辛说，历史不应该是记忆的负担，而应该是理智的启迪。贵国前总理勃兰特曾经说过：“谁忘记历史，谁就会在灵魂上生病。”中国人说，前事不忘，后事之师。中国人民从自身经历中形成了走和平发展道路的自觉选择，我们也真诚希望世界各国都走和平发展道路，携手建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社柏林3月28日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年03月30日 02 版）, ]",习近平在德国科尔伯基金会的演讲（全文）,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24773108
27,125,"[, Dear President Hollande, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Friends: On this bright spring day, I am very happy to be with you in the beautiful Paris to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and goodwill to all of you here, and through you, to people from all walks of life who have long been committed to the cause of China-France friendship and to the friendly French people. Wishes! , Sino-French relations are at an important moment of succession. When I came to France, I brought the Chinese government and people good memories of the friendship between the people of China and France and the sincere desire to deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France. , ""Draught does not forget to dig well."" At this moment, we will think of two great men. Fifty years ago, under the backdrop of the East and West Cold War, Chairman Mao Zedong and General Charles de Gaulle made an historic strategic decision to establish comprehensive diplomatic relations between China and France. Opened the door to mutual recognition and interaction. Since then, Sino-French relations have become a pair of special relations in the relations of world powers, and have always been at the forefront of China's relations with the major western developed countries. To summarize the past 50 years, China and France and the two peoples have jointly cultivated the spirit of independence, mutual understanding, foresight, and win-win cooperation in the development of relations between the two countries. This spirit has important guiding significance for us to create a better future for China-France relations. ——Independence is the common endowment of the Chinese nation and the French nation. Both China and France are ancient nations with unique civilizations. The two great nations, with the Yellow River Yangtze River and the Loire-Rhone water system as the mother river, have long led the civilization development process in their respective regions. Hundreds of Chinese scholars such as Laozi, Confucius, Mozi, Mencius, and Zhuangzi still have worldwide cultural significance, and the renowned French thinkers have provided precious spiritual wealth for all mankind. In the modern era, both countries have experienced national suffering, baptism of war, and arduous exploration of development models, and have embarked on a development path that suits their national conditions. Both China and France adhere to an independent foreign policy, do not drift with the waves and dance with the wind, and actively advocate and commit to multilateralism, world multi-polarization, and democratization of international relations. -Mutual understanding is an important cornerstone for the development of Sino-French relations. Fifty years ago, General Charles de Gaulle said: ""Both Chinese and French people have deep admiration and respect for each other, and the apparent tacit understanding between the two countries will one day develop into a deeper and deeper cooperation."" The distinctive culture deeply attracts the other people. Historically, Chinese culture has become the fashion of French society, and Chinese cultural elements can be found in the works of French enlightenment thinkers and the decoration of the Palace of Versailles. Similarly, the handed down works of French writers and artists are also loved by Chinese readers. Over the past 50 years, China and France and the two peoples have respected each other, treated each other equally, and trusted each other, which has laid an important foundation for the stability of the relations between the two countries. We all know that many of the older leaders of the Communist Party of China studied in France, and Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen and others are the best of them. For this reason, I was interested in French culture in my youth, and the history, philosophy, literature, and art of France attracted me deeply. Reading books on the history of modern French history, especially the history of the French Revolution, has enriched my thinking about the laws of human social and political evolution. Reading the works of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Saint Simon, Fourier, Sartre, etc., let me deepen my understanding of the role of ideological progress on the progress of human society. Reading the works of Montaigne, La Fontaine, Moliere, Stenda, Balzac, Hugo, Dumas, George Sand, Flaubert, Dumas, Maupassant, Roman Rowland and others, let me increase Feelings of joy and sorrow in human life. Artistic images such as Jean Valjean, Casimodo, and Sheep Fat Ball still exist in my mind to this day. Appreciating the art works of Miller, Manet, Degas, Cezanne, Monet, Rodin and others, as well as Zhao Wuji's combination of Chinese and Western paintings, I have improved my artistic appreciation ability. Also, reading Verne's science fiction novels filled my mind with endless imagination. Of course, French opera, ballet, architecture, sports, food, fashion, movies, etc. also have wide appeal in China. Understanding French culture has enabled me to better understand Chinese culture and better appreciate the profoundness and richness of human civilization. -A forward-looking vision is the fundamental guarantee for the development of Sino-French relations. Over the past 50 years, the leaders of the past generations of China and France, with their strategic vision of ""seeing the sky and not fearing the clouds,"" have persevered in transcending group confrontation and seeking common ground.. Over the past 50 years, the leaders of the past generations of China and France have carried out the exploration and practice of transcending group confrontation, seeking common ground while reserving differences, peaceful coexistence, and mutual benefit and win-win with the strategic vision of ascending the horizon. France is the first Western power to establish a comprehensive partnership, comprehensive strategic partnership and strategic dialogue with China. China and France have carried out many groundbreaking strategic cooperation. The two countries maintain close communication in international affairs and actively promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. , —— Mutual benefit and win-win situation is a powerful driving force for the sustainable development of China-France relations. China-France cooperation is a win-win cause, and the people of the two countries are the biggest beneficiaries of this cause. In the past 50 years, the bilateral trade volume has increased by more than 500 times compared with the beginning of the establishment of diplomatic relations; personnel exchanges have grown from scratch to nearly 2 million people per year; 50,000 French people are learning Chinese, and the number of Chinese people learning French has reached 100,000. Not long ago, Sophie Marceau stepped onto the stage of the Chinese New Year's Eve Gala with extremely high ratings in China. Sino-French cooperation has imperceptibly affected the lives of the two peoples and will surely create more and more well-being for the Chinese nation and the French nation. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Confucius said: ""Fifty knows the destiny."" As China-France relations enter the ""knowledge of destiny"" year, we must seize the present and face tomorrow, better plan the future development of the Sino-French relations, and make the Sino-French relations closer and more Long lasting and more special. First, adhere to mutual respect and trust and consolidate the political foundation of Sino-French relations. The two sides should firmly grasp the correct direction of the development of the relationship between the two countries, share solidarity, honor and disgrace, communicate frankly, seek common ground while reserving differences, and firmly support each other's efforts to safeguard their sovereignty, security, development and other core interests, strengthen strategic dialogue, deepen strategic cooperation, and properly handle differences To enhance the strategic, stability and predictability of Sino-French relations and better safeguard common interests. Second, adhere to mutual benefit and win-win results, and consolidate the economic foundation of China-France relations. Only when we dare to take the lead, can the road of economic cooperation become wider and wider, and the high-level political relations between China and France can be transformed into the well-being of the two peoples. The mid- and long-term plan for China-France relations just published is a guide for practical cooperation between the two countries in the future. China is willing to work with France to firmly establish a sense of interest community, find more points of interest and deepen economic cooperation. Third, adhere to friendship from generation to generation and build a solid social foundation for Sino-French relations. The two sides should take the opportunity of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the newly established Sino-French high-level humanities exchange mechanism as a platform to actively promote the wide-ranging exchanges and cooperation between the two societies and make the two peoples a firm supporter of friendly cooperation between China and France. Active builders and real beneficiaries, in particular, should guide the young people of the two countries to join the cause of Sino-French friendship. Fourthly, adhere to openness and enterprising and jointly promote world economic growth. It is in the common interest of all countries in the world to improve the level of economic cooperation, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and oppose protectionism. We must strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, promote the reform of the international economic, financial, and monetary systems, promote the construction of an open and equitable multilateral trading system, strengthen international assistance, exchanges, and cooperation, and promote the development of economic globalization in the direction of inclusiveness and win-win. , Fifth, adhere to close collaboration and work together to meet global challenges. Both sides should strengthen consultation, coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, continue to promote world multipolarization and democratization of international relations, promote equal consultation and collectively formulate international rules, and make Sino-French relations important for maintaining world peace and promoting human progress power. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , With dreams, opportunities, and struggles, all beautiful things can be created. At present, the Chinese people are striving to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. President Holland also proposed the French dream. When President Hollande visited China last year, he also suggested to me that on the basis of the realization of their dreams, the two peoples should strive to realize the ""Sino-French dream"". Since modern times, the greatest dream of the Chinese nation is to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China's historical culture, historical destiny, and historical conditions determine that the Chinese people must realize their dreams on the path they choose. , ——The Chinese dream is the dream of pursuing peace. The Chinese dream needs peace, and only peace can realize the dream. Peace and harmony are the ideals of the Chinese nation for thousands of years. After suffering, the Chinese people cherish peace and hope to seek peace, protect and share peace with all countries in the world. History will prove that the realization of the Chinese dream brings the world opportunities, not threats, peace, turbulence, progress, or retrogression. Napoleon said that China is a sleeping lion, and when this sleeping lion wakes up, the world will tremble. The Chinese lion has woken up, but this is a peaceful, amiable and civilized lion. , ——The Chinese dream is the dream of happiness. The Chinese dream is the dream of the Chinese nation and the dream of every Chinese. Our direction is to let everyMing lion. , ——The Chinese dream is the dream of happiness. The Chinese dream is the dream of the Chinese nation and the dream of every Chinese. Our direction is to give everyone the opportunity to develop themselves and dedicate themselves to society, to enjoy the opportunity to make a difference in life, to share the opportunity to realize dreams, to ensure equal participation and equal development rights for the people, to safeguard social fairness and justice, and to make more development achievements More fair to all people, and steadily move towards common prosperity. , ——The Chinese dream is the dream of dedication to the world. ""Poverty is good for oneself, while others are good for the world."" This is the morality and mind that the Chinese nation has always advocated. China is dedicated to managing its own affairs, not only being responsible for itself, but also contributing to the world. As China continues to develop, China has and will continue to do its utmost to make its own contribution to world peace and development. , In order to realize the Chinese dream, we have established the goal of ""two hundred years"", which is to achieve GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents by 2020, double the 2010, and build a well-off society in an all-round way; by the middle of this century A prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country has achieved great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We recognize that in order to realize the Chinese dream, we must comprehensively deepen reforms, further emancipate the mind, emancipate and develop social productive forces, emancipate and enhance social vitality. In November last year, the Communist Party of China convened the Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to make overall arrangements for comprehensively deepening reforms and sounded the collective number of a new round of comprehensive reforms. We will improve the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities through reforms in various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, so that the market will play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and better play the government. effect. At present, these reform measures have established a general ledger and clarified the responsibility system, and are being implemented one by one. Looking to the future, China has huge development potential and broad prospects. China's development will surely provide greater cooperation space for all countries in the world. , ""Everything is bred without harming each other, and the ways are parallel without contradictions."" The Chinese dream is an opportunity for France, and the French dream is also an opportunity for China. Creating a new era of close and lasting comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France is our only correct choice and the most important strategic consensus reached with President Hollande during my visit to France. I sincerely hope that China and France and the two peoples will understand and help each other in the process of realizing the Chinese dream and the French dream, and jointly realize the ""Sino-French dream"". , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The exchange of countries lies in the blind date of the people. China-France relations can have such a good situation today, thanks to the people of the two countries sharing the same soul, feelings of love, and mutual help. We will not forget that countless French friends have made important contributions to the development of various undertakings in China. Some of them risked their lives to open a bicycle ""hump route"" and transport precious medicines to the Chinese anti-Japanese base Beixiye, and some were in danger during the Sichuan Wenchuan earthquake, and they guarded the trapped elevator in the strong aftershocks. The little girl’s French military doctor Uel, the French charity Fang Fang who fully supports the Chinese out-of-school children, the Bauer coach who has trained many Chinese saber world champions, and the new coach of the Chinese national men’s football team Mr. Alan Perrin. Fans in China have high expectations for him, and I wish him good luck. , France has a proverb: ""One by one, little birds build a nest."" There is also an old saying in China: ""The wood of the embrace is born at the end; the nine-story platform starts from tired soil."" The friendship between China and France is the people of the two countries The result of hard work. Taking this opportunity, I would like to pay high tribute to these people who have dedicated themselves to the cause of China-France friendship! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! After reviewing the past, I am confident that we will continue to advance the cause of Sino-French friendship at a new historical starting point. Let us work together to create a bright future for China-France relations! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 27th), ""People's Daily"" (March 29, 2014, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France,4240,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-03-29,"[,  , 尊敬的奥朗德总统，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 在这春光明媚的日子，同大家在美丽的巴黎欢聚一堂，纪念中法建交50周年，感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位，并通过各位，向长期致力于中法友好事业的各界人士，向友好的法国人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 中法关系正处在承前启后的重要时刻。我来到法国，带来的是中国政府和人民对中法两国人民友谊的美好回忆和深化中法全面战略伙伴关系的真诚愿望。, “吃水不忘挖井人。”此时此刻，我们都会想起两位伟人。50年前，在东西方冷战正酣的大背景下，毛泽东主席和戴高乐将军以超凡的战略眼光，毅然作出中法全面建交的历史性决策，在中法之间同时也在中国同西方世界之间打开了相互认知和交往的大门。从此，中法关系成为世界大国关系中的一对特殊关系，始终走在中国同西方主要发达国家关系前列。, 总结过去的50年，中法两国和两国人民在发展两国关系中，共同培育了独立自主、相互理解、高瞻远瞩、合作共赢的精神。这一精神，对我们开创中法关系更加美好的未来具有重要指导意义。, ——独立自主，是中华民族和法兰西民族的共有禀赋。中国和法国都是有着独特文明的古老国度。以黄河长江和卢瓦尔—罗讷水系为母亲河的两个伟大民族，都曾经长期引领各自所在地区的文明发展进程。老子、孔子、墨子、孟子、庄子等中国诸子百家学说至今仍然具有世界性的文化意义，声名远扬的法国思想家们为全人类提供了宝贵精神财富。进入近现代，两国都经历了民族苦难、战火洗礼和对发展模式的艰辛探索，走出了符合本国国情的发展道路。中法都坚持独立自主的外交政策，不随波逐流，不随风起舞，积极倡导和致力于多边主义、世界多极化、国际关系民主化。, ——相互理解，是中法关系发展的重要基石。50年前，戴高乐将军说：“中法两大民族都对对方怀有深厚的仰慕和尊敬，两国间存在的明显默契总有一天会发展成一种越来越深厚的合作。”两国特色鲜明的文化深深吸引着对方人民。历史上，中华文化曾经成为法国社会的时尚，在法国启蒙思想家的著作和凡尔赛宫的装饰中都能找到中华文化元素。同样，法国作家和艺术家的传世之作也深受广大中国读者喜爱。50年来，中法两国和两国人民相互尊重、平等相待、彼此信任，为两国关系走稳走远打下了重要基础。, 我们都知道，中国共产党老一代领导人中很多是在法国负笈求学的，周恩来、邓小平、蔡和森、陈毅、聂荣臻等人就是他们中的佼佼者。由于这个原因，我青年时代就对法国文化抱有浓厚兴趣，法国的历史、哲学、文学、艺术深深吸引着我。读法国近现代史特别是法国大革命史的书籍，让我丰富了对人类社会政治演进规律的思考。读孟德斯鸠、伏尔泰、卢梭、狄德罗、圣西门、傅立叶、萨特等人的著作，让我加深了对思想进步对人类社会进步作用的认识。读蒙田、拉封丹、莫里哀、司汤达、巴尔扎克、雨果、大仲马、乔治·桑、福楼拜、小仲马、莫泊桑、罗曼·罗兰等人的著作，让我增加了对人类生活中悲欢离合的感触。冉阿让、卡西莫多、羊脂球等艺术形象至今仍栩栩如生地存在于我的脑海之中。欣赏米勒、马奈、德加、塞尚、莫奈、罗丹等人的艺术作品，以及赵无极中西合璧的画作，让我提升了自己的艺术鉴赏能力。还有，读凡尔纳的科幻小说，让我的头脑充满了无尽的想象。当然，法国的歌剧、芭蕾舞、建筑、体育、美食、时尚、电影等在中国也有广泛的吸引力。了解法兰西文化，使我能够更好认识中华文化，更好领略人类文明的博大精深、丰富多彩。, ——高瞻远瞩，是中法关系发展的根本保证。50年来，中法历代领导人以登高望远的战略眼光，“不畏浮云遮望眼”，坚持不懈进行着超越集团对抗、求同存异、和平共处、互利共赢的探索和实践。法国是第一个同中国建立全面伙伴关系、全面战略伙伴关系，开展战略对话的西方大国。中法两国开展了许多具有开创性的战略合作。两国在国际事务中保持密切沟通，积极推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。, ——互利共赢，是中法关系持续发展的强大动力。中法合作是双赢的事业，两国人民是这一事业的最大受益者。50年来，双边贸易额比建交之初增加500多倍；人员往来从无到有，已经接近每年200万人次；有5万法国人正在学习汉语，学习法语的中国人数达到10万。不久前，苏菲·玛索走上了中国收视率极高的马年春节联欢晚会舞台。中法合作潜移默化影响着两国人民生活，必将为中华民族和法兰西民族创造出越来越多的福祉。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 孔子说：“五十而知天命。”在中法关系进入“知天命”之年，我们要抓住当下、面向明天，更好规划中法关系未来发展，让中法关系更加紧密、更加持久、更加特殊。, 第一，坚持互尊互信，巩固中法关系政治基础。双方要牢牢把握两国关系发展的正确方向，同舟共济、荣辱与共，坦诚沟通、求同存异，坚定支持对方维护本国主权、安全、发展等核心利益的努力，加强战略对话，深化战略合作，妥善处理分歧，增强中法关系的战略性、稳定性、可预见性，更好维护共同利益。, 第二，坚持互利共赢，夯实中法关系经济基础。只有敢为人先，经济合作之路才能越走越宽，中法高水平的政治关系才能转化为两国人民的福祉。刚刚发表的中法关系中长期规划是未来一段时期两国务实合作指南。中方愿意同法方一道，牢固树立利益共同体意识，寻找更多利益契合点，深化经济合作。, 第三，坚持世代友好，筑牢中法关系社会基础。双方要以建交50周年庆祝活动为契机，以刚刚建立的中法高级别人文交流机制为平台，积极推动两国社会各界广泛开展交流合作，使两国人民成为中法友好合作的坚定支持者、积极建设者、真正受益者，尤其要引导两国广大青年投身到中法友好事业中来。, 第四，坚持开放进取，共同促进世界经济增长。要提高经济合作水平，推动贸易和投资自由化便利化，反对保护主义，符合世界各国共同利益。要加强宏观经济政策协调，推动国际经济、金融、货币体系改革，推动建设开放公平的多边贸易体系，加强国际援助交流合作，推动经济全球化朝着普惠共赢的方向发展。, 第五，坚持紧密协作，携手应对全球性挑战。双方要加强在国际和地区事务中的磋商、协调、配合，继续推动世界多极化、国际关系民主化，推动平等协商集体制定国际规则，使中法关系成为维护世界和平、促进人类进步的重要力量。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 有梦想，有机会，有奋斗，一切美好的东西都能创造出来。当前，中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。奥朗德总统也提出了法国梦。去年奥朗德总统访华时还向我建议，在两国人民实现各自梦想的基础上，努力实现“中法梦”。, 近代以来，中华民族最大的梦想就是实现中华民族伟大复兴。中国的历史文化、历史命运、历史条件决定了中国人民必须在自己选择的道路上实现自己的梦想。, ——中国梦是追求和平的梦。中国梦需要和平，只有和平才能实现梦想。天下太平、共享大同是中华民族绵延数千年的理想。历经苦难，中国人民珍惜和平，希望同世界各国一道共谋和平、共护和平、共享和平。历史将证明，实现中国梦给世界带来的是机遇不是威胁，是和平不是动荡，是进步不是倒退。拿破仑说过，中国是一头沉睡的狮子，当这头睡狮醒来时，世界都会为之发抖。中国这头狮子已经醒了，但这是一只和平的、可亲的、文明的狮子。, ——中国梦是追求幸福的梦。中国梦是中华民族的梦，也是每个中国人的梦。我们的方向就是让每个人获得发展自我和奉献社会的机会，共同享有人生出彩的机会，共同享有梦想成真的机会，保证人民平等参与、平等发展权利，维护社会公平正义，使发展成果更多更公平惠及全体人民，朝着共同富裕方向稳步前进。, ——中国梦是奉献世界的梦。“穷则独善其身，达则兼善天下。”这是中华民族始终崇尚的品德和胸怀。中国一心一意办好自己的事情，既是对自己负责，也是为世界作贡献。随着中国不断发展，中国已经并将继续尽己所能，为世界和平与发展作出自己的贡献。, 为了实现中国梦，我们确立了“两个一百年”奋斗目标，就是到2020年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴。, 我们认识到，为了实现中国梦，必须全面深化改革，进一步解放思想、解放和发展社会生产力、解放和增强社会活力。去年11月，中国共产党召开了十八届三中全会，对全面深化改革作出总体部署，吹响了新一轮全面改革的集合号。我们将通过经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明等各领域改革，完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度、推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用。目前，这些改革举措都建立了总台账、明确了责任制，正在逐项抓落实。展望未来，中国发展潜力巨大、前景广阔，中国发展必将为世界各国提供更大合作空间。, “万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。”中国梦是法国的机遇，法国梦也是中国的机遇。开创紧密持久的中法全面战略伙伴关系新时代，是我们唯一正确的选择，也是我这次访法期间，同奥朗德总统达成的最重要战略共识。我真诚希望，中法两国和两国人民在实现中国梦和法国梦的过程中相互理解、相互帮助，共同实现“中法梦”。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 国之交在于民相亲。中法关系能有今天这样的好局面，要归功于两国人民心灵相通、感情相亲、守望相助。, 我们不会忘记，无数法国友人为中国各项事业发展作出了重要贡献。他们中有冒着生命危险开辟一条自行车“驼峰航线”、把宝贵的药品运往中国抗日根据地的法国医生贝熙叶，有在四川汶川特大地震期间临危不惧、在强烈余震中舍身守护被困电梯的中国小女孩的法国军医乌埃尔，有倾力支持中国失学儿童上学的法国公益人士方芳，有培养出多位中国佩剑世界冠军的鲍埃尔教练，还有刚刚担任中国国家男子足球队主教练的阿兰·佩兰先生。中国广大球迷对他寄予了热切期待，我祝他好运。, 法国有一句谚语：“一点又一点，小鸟筑成巢。”中国也有一句古语：“合抱之木，生于毫末；九层之台，起于累土。”中法友谊是两国人民辛勤耕耘的结果。借此机会，我要向这些为中法友好事业默默奉献的人们致以崇高的敬意！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 抚今追昔，我对在新的历史起点上继续推进中法友好事业充满信心。让我们携手努力，共创中法关系美好前景！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社巴黎3月27日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年03月29日 02 版）, ]",习近平在中法建交五十周年纪念大会上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24770826
28,126,"[, Dear Director General Bokova,, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Hello everyone! I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to the UNESCO headquarters. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Bokova on her election as Director-General of UNESCO! I sincerely pay tribute to UNESCO's outstanding contributions to promoting exchanges and mutual learning of human civilization! , UNESCO was born 69 years ago, when the world anti-fascist war smoke had just dispersed. Faced with the tragic consequences of war for humanity, humanity once again reflected on the true meaning of war and peace. For thousands of years, mankind has dreamed of lasting peace, but war has always accompanied human development as a ghost. At this moment, many children in the world are living in fear of war. We must make efforts to keep war away from mankind, and let children all over the world grow up happily in peaceful sunlight. , The stone tablet in front of the UNESCO headquarters building is engraved with a sentence in multiple languages: ""War originates in the mind of man, and the cause must be built in the mind of man to defend the barrier of peace."", as long as the people of the world By strengthening the concept of peace and raising the sail of peace in the soul, a powerful force for preventing and opposing war can be formed. People hope to eliminate barriers, prejudice, and hatred through the exchange of civilizations, equal education, and popularization of science. This is the original intention of UNESCO. , Such an expectation, such a longing, we still have to stick to it today. Not only to persevere, but also through cross-border, cross-space, cross-civilization education, science and technology, and cultural activities, let the seeds of the peace concept take root in the hearts of the people of the world, and let the planet we live on grow a peaceful forest. . Since its establishment in 1945, UNESCO has faithfully fulfilled its mission and has made unremitting efforts to enhance mutual understanding and trust among people of the world and promote exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations. China attaches great importance to cooperation with UNESCO and is willing to increase its participation in various activities of UNESCO. In order to reflect the support and help for Africa, we decided to expand the quota of Great Wall scholarships provided by UNESCO to developing countries, including African countries, from 25 to 75 per year. We will also work together with UNESCO to provide assistance The activities of the African Trust Fund continued. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Civilization is colorful because of exchanges, and civilization is rich because of mutual learning. Civilization exchanges and mutual learning are an important driving force for the advancement of human civilization and the peaceful development of the world. , Promoting the exchange and mutual learning of civilizations requires a correct attitude and principles. I think the most important thing is to stick to the following points. First, civilizations are colorful, and human civilization has the value of exchange and mutual learning because of its diversity. There are seven colors of sunlight, and the world is also colorful. The civilization of a country and nation is the collective memory of a country and nation. In the long course of history, human beings have created and developed colorful civilizations. From Ru Mao drinking blood to pastoral farming, from the Industrial Revolution to the information society, it constitutes a magnificent map of civilization and writes an exciting chapter of civilization. , ""One flower alone is not spring, a hundred flowers bloom together in the spring."" If there is only one kind of flower in the world, even if this kind of flower is beautiful, it is monotonous. Whether it is the Chinese civilization or other civilizations that exist in the world, they are the fruits of human civilization. , I have visited the Louvre in France and the Palace Museum in China. They have tens of thousands of art treasures. What attracts people’s attention is the diverse achievements of civilization. Civilization exchanges and mutual learning should not be premised on respecting or derogating a certain civilization. The Chinese realized the principle of ""the difference between things and the feeling of things"" more than 2000 years ago. Promoting exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations can enrich the colors of human civilization, allow people from all countries to enjoy a more spiritual life and create a more selective future. Second, civilizations are equal, and human civilizations have the premise of exchange and mutual learning because of equality. All human civilizations are equal in value, each has its own strengths and weaknesses. There are no perfect civilizations in the world, nor civilizations that are totally useless. There is no distinction between high and low civilizations. , I have visited many places in the world, and one of my favorite things to do is to understand the different civilizations of the five continents, to understand the differences and uniqueness of these civilizations and other civilizations, to understand the world view of the people living in these civilizations, View of a person's life, values. I have been to Chichen Itza, which represents ancient Mayan civilization, and also to Samarkand, the ancient city of Central Asia with a strong Islamic civilization. I deeply feel that to understand the true meaning of various civilizations, we must uphold an equal and humble attitude. If one is condescending to treat a civilization, not only does it notMarhan. I deeply feel that to understand the true meaning of various civilizations, we must uphold an equal and humble attitude. If one is condescending to treat a civilization, not only can not understand the mystery of this civilization, but also will be out of tune with it. Both history and reality show that arrogance and prejudice are the biggest obstacles for civilizations to communicate and learn from each other. Third, civilization is inclusive, and human civilization has the motivation to communicate and learn from each other because of tolerance. Be tolerant to diversity, tolerance is a virtue. The civilizations created by mankind are the crystallization of labor and wisdom. Every civilization is unique. Regarding the issue of civilization, it is not only impossible to cut back on the ground, and to cut the foot to the right is very harmful. All achievements of civilization are worthy of respect, and all achievements of civilization must be cherished. History tells us that a civilization can only be full of vitality if we exchange and learn from each other. As long as the spirit of tolerance is upheld, there will be no ""civilization conflicts"" and civilization harmony can be achieved. This is what the Chinese often say: ""radish and green vegetables, each has its own love."", Chinese civilization has undergone more than 5,000 years of historical changes, but it has always been in the same line, accumulating the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese nation and representing the unique spirit of the Chinese nation. The logo provides a rich nourishment for the endless growth and development of the Chinese nation. The Chinese civilization is a civilization born on the land of China, and is also a civilization formed by continuous exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations. , More than 100 BC, China began to open up the Silk Road to the Western Regions. In the Han dynasty, Zhang Qian made two missions to the Western Region in 138 BC and 119 BC, spreading Chinese culture to the Western Region, and also introduced grape, alfalfa, pomegranate, flax, sesame and other cultural achievements in the Western Region. During the Western Han Dynasty, the Chinese fleet arrived in India and Sri Lanka and exchanged Chinese silk for glaze, pearls and other items. The Tang Dynasty in China was an active period of foreign exchange in Chinese history. According to historical records, there were as many as 70 countries in China in the Tang Dynasty, and the capital of Chang'an at that time came from a group of envoys, businessmen, and international students from various countries. This great exchange has promoted the spread of Chinese culture to the world, and has also promoted the spread of cultures and properties of various countries to China. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, a famous Chinese navigator from the Ming Dynasty, made seven ocean-going trips to many countries in Southeast Asia and arrived in Kenya on the east coast of Africa, leaving behind the good news of China's friendly exchanges with people along the way. From the end of Ming Dynasty to the beginning of Qing Dynasty, Chinese people actively studied modern scientific and technological knowledge, and European astronomy, medicine, mathematics, geometry, and geography knowledge were introduced into China one after another, broadening the knowledge horizon of Chinese people. Since then, Chinese and foreign civilization exchanges and mutual learning have been carried out frequently. Among them are conflicts, contradictions, doubts and rejections, but more are learning, digestion, integration and innovation. , Buddhism was born in ancient India, but after it was introduced into China, after a long period of evolution, Buddhism merged and developed with Chinese Confucian culture and Taoist culture, and finally formed a Buddhist culture with Chinese characteristics, giving religious beliefs, philosophies, and literature to the Chinese. , Etiquette and customs have left a profound impact. Xuan Zang's journey to the west in the Tang Dynasty in China was a triumph of hardships, reflecting the tenacity of the Chinese learning foreign cultures. According to the mythical novel ""Journey to the West"" based on his story, I think everyone knows it. The Chinese developed Buddhism thoughts based on Chinese culture, forming a unique Buddhist theory, and spreading Buddhism from China to Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and other places. For more than 2000 years, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity have been introduced to China, and Chinese music, painting, and literature have also constantly absorbed the advantages of foreign civilization. The combination of traditional Chinese painting techniques and western oil paintings has created a unique Chinese freehand oil painting. The works of Xu Beihong and other masters have been widely appreciated. The four major inventions of papermaking, gunpowder, printing, and compass in China have driven world change and promoted the European Renaissance. Chinese philosophy, literature, medicine, silk, porcelain, tea, etc. were introduced into the West and penetrated into the daily lives of Western people. ""Marco Polo's Travels"" makes countless people yearn for China. Everyone knows that there are Qin figurines in China, and people call them ""underground legions."" French President Chirac said after the visit: ""If you don't look at the pyramids, you don't really have been to Egypt. You don't look at the Qin figurines, you don't really have been to China."" In 1987, this treasure of Chinese culture, which had been dustproof for more than 2000 years, was listed in the world. Cultural heritage. China also has a large number of civilization achievements listed by UNESCO in the list of World Cultural Heritage, World Intangible Cultural Heritage, and World Memory Heritage. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to UNESCO for its contribution to the preservation and spread of Chinese civilization! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In today's world, human beings live in a world composed of different cultures, races, skin colors, religions, and different social systems. People of all countries have formed a community of destiny between you and me. The Chinese have long understood the principle of ""harmony and difference"". Zuo Qiuming, a Chinese historian who lived 2500 years ago, recorded in ""Zuo Zhuan""Same body. The Chinese have long understood the principle of ""harmony and difference"". The Chinese historian Zuo Qiuming, who lived 2,500 years ago, recorded in the ""Zuo Zhuan"" a paragraph about the ""harmony"" of Yan Zi, a doctor from the Qi Kingdom: ""He Ru Xuan Yan, water, fire, yam, yam, salt, plum , To cook fish meat."" ""Sound is like taste, one gas, two bodies, three types, four things, five sounds, six laws, seven sounds, eight winds, nine songs, and the water can be combined."" , Who can eat it? If there is a single one, who can listen to it?"", There are more than 200 countries and regions in the world, more than 2,500 nationalities and multiple religions. If there is only one way of life, only one language, only one kind of music, only one kind of clothing, that is unthinkable. , Hugo said that the widest in the world is the ocean, the sky is wider than the ocean, and the mind is wider than the sky. To treat different civilizations, we need a broader mind than the sky. Civilization is like water, and moist things are silent. We should promote mutual respect and harmonious coexistence of different civilizations, and make exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations a bridge to enhance friendship between peoples of all countries, a driving force to advance human society, and a link to maintain world peace. We should seek wisdom and nutrients from different civilizations, provide people with spiritual support and spiritual comfort, and work together to solve various challenges facing humanity. , In 1987, 20 fabulous glazes were unearthed in the underground palace in Famen Temple, Shaanxi, China. These were the glazes of the Eastern Rome and Islam that were introduced to China in the Tang Dynasty. When I admire these extraterritorial cultural relics, I have been thinking about a problem, that is, to treat different civilizations, not only to appreciate the exquisite objects they produce, but also to appreciate the humanistic spirit contained in them; not only to appreciate their understanding of people's lives in the past The artistic expression of should make the spirit contained therein fresh. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Napoleon once said that there are two forces in the world: sword and thought; in the long run, the sword is always defeated by the mind. We must actively develop education, through universal education, enlighten the mind, pass on knowledge, and cultivate sentiment, so that people can better understand the value of various civilizations in the continuous knowledge of things, and let education serve the inheritance and creation of civilization. We must vigorously develop scientific and technological undertakings, through technological advancement and innovation, to understand ourselves, to understand the world, and to transform society, so that people can better grasp scientific and technological knowledge and skills in the continuous creation of science and technology, and let science and technology benefit mankind. We must vigorously promote the development of cultural undertakings, through cultural exchanges, communicate the soul, broaden our horizons, increase consensus, let people continue to improve their literacy among cultural people, and let culture help human progress. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Chinese people are striving to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is to realize the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the happiness of the people. It not only deeply reflects the ideals of the Chinese today, but also deeply reflects the glorious tradition of the Chinese people's unremitting pursuit of progress since ancient times. The realization of the Chinese dream is the result of the balanced development and mutual promotion of material civilization and spiritual civilization. Without the inheritance and development of civilization, and without the promotion and prosperity of culture, there will be no realization of the Chinese dream. The ancestors of the Chinese nation have long longed for the Datong world where people’s material life is full of worries and their moral realm is fully sublimated. Chinese civilization has always incorporated human spiritual life into the ideals of life and society. Therefore, the realization of the Chinese dream is a development process in which material civilization and spiritual civilization fly together. With the continuous development of China's economy and society, the Chinese civilization will also radiate more vitality in keeping with the development of the times. Each civilization continues the spirit and blood of a country and a nation. It not only needs to be handed down for generations, to be guarded from generation to generation, but also needs to advance with the times and be brave to innovate. In the process of realizing the Chinese dream, the Chinese people will promote the creative transformation and innovative development of the Chinese civilization in accordance with the new progress of the times, activate their vitality, and carry forward the cultural spirit that spans time and space, transcends the country, has eternal charm, and has contemporary values. So that the cultural relics collected in the museum, the heritage displayed on the vast earth, and the text written in ancient books can all be brought alive, allowing the Chinese civilization to work with the rich and colorful civilizations created by the people of all countries in the world to provide correct spiritual guidance and Strong spiritual power. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""Waiting for a glimpse of the east wind, it's always spring."" Next year is the 70th anniversary of the founding of UNESCO. I believe that under the leadership of Director General Bokova, UNESCO will surely promote mutual exchanges between human civilizations and the world. Peace writes a new chapter. , thank you all. (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 27th), ""People's Daily"" (March 28, 2014, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the UNESCO headquarters,4460,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-03-28,"[, 尊敬的博科娃总干事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！有机会来到联合国教科文组织总部，感到十分高兴。首先，我谨对博科娃女士再次当选教科文组织总干事，表示衷心的祝贺！对教科文组织为推动人类文明交流互鉴作出的卓越贡献，表示诚挚的敬意！, 教科文组织诞生于69年前，那时世界反法西斯战争硝烟刚刚散去。面对战争给人类带来的惨烈后果，人类又一次反思战争与和平的真谛。千百年来，人类都梦想着持久和平，但战争始终像一个幽灵一样伴随着人类发展历程。此时此刻，世界上很多孩子正生活在战乱的惊恐之中。我们必须作出努力，让战争远离人类，让全世界的孩子们都在和平的阳光下幸福成长。, 在教科文组织总部大楼前的石碑上，用多种语言镌刻着这样一句话：“战争起源于人之思想，故务需于人之思想中筑起保卫和平之屏障。”, 只要世界人民在心灵中坚定了和平理念、扬起了和平风帆，就能形成防止和反对战争的强大力量。人们希望通过文明交流、平等教育、普及科学，消除隔阂、偏见、仇视，播撒和平理念的种子。这就是教科文组织成立的初衷。, 这样一种期待，这样一种憧憬，是我们今天依然要坚守的。不仅要坚守，而且要通过跨国界、跨时空、跨文明的教育、科技、文化活动，让和平理念的种子在世界人民心中生根发芽，让我们共同生活的这个星球生长出一片又一片和平的森林。, 自1945年成立以来，教科文组织忠实履行使命，在增进世界人民相互了解和信任、推动不同文明交流互鉴方面进行了不懈努力。中国高度重视同教科文组织的合作，愿意加大参与教科文组织的各项活动。为体现对非洲的支持和帮助，我们决定把通过教科文组织向包括非洲国家在内的发展中国家提供的长城奖学金名额由每年25人扩大为75人，我们还将同教科文组织一道把援助非洲信托基金的活动继续开展下去。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 文明因交流而多彩，文明因互鉴而丰富。文明交流互鉴，是推动人类文明进步和世界和平发展的重要动力。, 推动文明交流互鉴，需要秉持正确的态度和原则。我认为，最重要的是坚持以下几点。, 第一，文明是多彩的，人类文明因多样才有交流互鉴的价值。阳光有七种颜色，世界也是多彩的。一个国家和民族的文明是一个国家和民族的集体记忆。人类在漫长的历史长河中，创造和发展了多姿多彩的文明。从茹毛饮血到田园农耕，从工业革命到信息社会，构成了波澜壮阔的文明图谱，书写了激荡人心的文明华章。, “一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。”如果世界上只有一种花朵，就算这种花朵再美，那也是单调的。不论是中华文明，还是世界上存在的其他文明，都是人类文明创造的成果。, 我参观过法国卢浮宫，也参观过中国故宫博物院，它们珍藏着千万件艺术珍品，吸引人们眼球的正是其展现的多样文明成果。文明交流互鉴不应该以独尊某一种文明或者贬损某一种文明为前提。中国人在2000多年前就认识到了“物之不齐，物之情也”的道理。推动文明交流互鉴，可以丰富人类文明的色彩，让各国人民享受更富内涵的精神生活、开创更有选择的未来。, 第二，文明是平等的，人类文明因平等才有交流互鉴的前提。各种人类文明在价值上是平等的，都各有千秋，也各有不足。世界上不存在十全十美的文明，也不存在一无是处的文明，文明没有高低、优劣之分。, 我访问过世界上许多地方，最喜欢做的一件事情就是了解五大洲的不同文明，了解这些文明与其他文明的不同之处、独到之处，了解在这些文明中生活的人们的世界观、人生观、价值观。我到过代表古玛雅文明的奇琴伊察，也到过带有浓厚伊斯兰文明色彩的中亚古城撒马尔罕。我深深感到，要了解各种文明的真谛，必须秉持平等、谦虚的态度。如果居高临下对待一种文明，不仅不能参透这种文明的奥妙，而且会与之格格不入。历史和现实都表明，傲慢和偏见是文明交流互鉴的最大障碍。, 第三，文明是包容的，人类文明因包容才有交流互鉴的动力。海纳百川，有容乃大。人类创造的各种文明都是劳动和智慧的结晶。每一种文明都是独特的。在文明问题上，生搬硬套、削足适履不仅是不可能的，而且是十分有害的。一切文明成果都值得尊重，一切文明成果都要珍惜。, 历史告诉我们，只有交流互鉴，一种文明才能充满生命力。只要秉持包容精神，就不存在什么“文明冲突”，就可以实现文明和谐。这就是中国人常说的：“萝卜青菜，各有所爱。”, 中华文明经历了5000多年的历史变迁，但始终一脉相承，积淀着中华民族最深层的精神追求，代表着中华民族独特的精神标识，为中华民族生生不息、发展壮大提供了丰厚滋养。中华文明是在中国大地上产生的文明，也是同其他文明不断交流互鉴而形成的文明。, 公元前100多年，中国就开始开辟通往西域的丝绸之路。汉代张骞于公元前138年和119年两次出使西域，向西域传播了中华文化，也引进了葡萄、苜蓿、石榴、胡麻、芝麻等西域文化成果。西汉时期，中国的船队就到达了印度和斯里兰卡，用中国的丝绸换取了琉璃、珍珠等物品。中国唐代是中国历史上对外交流的活跃期。据史料记载，唐代中国通使交好的国家多达70多个，那时候的首都长安里来自各国的使臣、商人、留学生云集成群。这个大交流促进了中华文化远播世界，也促进了各国文化和物产传入中国。15世纪初，中国明代著名航海家郑和七次远洋航海，到了东南亚很多国家，一直抵达非洲东海岸的肯尼亚，留下了中国同沿途各国人民友好交往的佳话。明末清初，中国人积极学习现代科技知识，欧洲的天文学、医学、数学、几何学、地理学知识纷纷传入中国，开阔中国人的知识视野。之后，中外文明交流互鉴更是频繁展开，这其中有冲突、矛盾、疑惑、拒绝，但更多是学习、消化、融合、创新。, 佛教产生于古代印度，但传入中国后，经过长期演化，佛教同中国儒家文化和道家文化融合发展，最终形成了具有中国特色的佛教文化，给中国人的宗教信仰、哲学观念、文学艺术、礼仪习俗等留下了深刻影响。中国唐代玄奘西行取经，历尽磨难，体现的是中国人学习域外文化的坚韧精神。根据他的故事演绎的神话小说《西游记》，我想大家都知道。中国人根据中华文化发展了佛教思想，形成了独特的佛教理论，而且使佛教从中国传播到了日本、韩国、东南亚等地。, 2000多年来，佛教、伊斯兰教、基督教等先后传入中国，中国音乐、绘画、文学等也不断吸纳外来文明的优长。中国传统画法同西方油画融合创新，形成了独具魅力的中国写意油画，徐悲鸿等大师的作品受到广泛赞赏。中国的造纸术、火药、印刷术、指南针四大发明带动了世界变革，推动了欧洲文艺复兴。中国哲学、文学、医药、丝绸、瓷器、茶叶等传入西方，渗入西方民众日常生活之中。《马可·波罗游记》令无数人对中国心向往之。, 大家都知道，中国有秦俑，人们称之为“地下的军团”。法国总统希拉克参观之后说：“不看金字塔，不算真正到过埃及。不看秦俑，不算真正到过中国。”1987年，这一尘封了2000多年的中华文化珍品被列入世界文化遗产。中国还有大量文明成果被教科文组织列入世界文化遗产、世界非物质文化遗产、世界记忆遗产名录。这里，我要对教科文组织为保存和传播中华文明作出的贡献，表示衷心的感谢！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当今世界，人类生活在不同文化、种族、肤色、宗教和不同社会制度所组成的世界里，各国人民形成了你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。, 中国人早就懂得了“和而不同”的道理。生活在2500年前的中国史学家左丘明在《左传》中记录了齐国上大夫晏子关于“和”的一段话：“和如羹焉，水、火、醯、醢、盐、梅，以烹鱼肉。”“声亦如味，一气，二体，三类，四物，五声，六律，七音，八风，九歌，以相成也。”“若以水济水，谁能食之？若琴瑟之专壹，谁能听之？”, 世界上有200多个国家和地区，2500多个民族和多种宗教。如果只有一种生活方式，只有一种语言，只有一种音乐，只有一种服饰，那是不可想象的。, 雨果说，世界上最宽阔的是海洋，比海洋更宽阔的是天空，比天空更宽阔的是人的胸怀。对待不同文明，我们需要比天空更宽阔的胸怀。文明如水，润物无声。我们应该推动不同文明相互尊重、和谐共处，让文明交流互鉴成为增进各国人民友谊的桥梁、推动人类社会进步的动力、维护世界和平的纽带。我们应该从不同文明中寻求智慧、汲取营养，为人们提供精神支撑和心灵慰藉，携手解决人类共同面临的各种挑战。, 1987年，在中国陕西的法门寺，地宫中出土了20件美轮美奂的琉璃器，这是唐代传入中国的东罗马和伊斯兰的琉璃器。我在欣赏这些域外文物时，一直在思考一个问题，就是对待不同文明，不能只满足于欣赏它们产生的精美物件，更应该去领略其中包含的人文精神；不能只满足于领略它们对以往人们生活的艺术表现，更应该让其中蕴藏的精神鲜活起来。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 拿破仑曾经说过，世上有两种力量：利剑和思想；从长而论，利剑总是败在思想手下。我们要积极发展教育事业，通过普及教育，启迪心智，传承知识，陶冶情操，使人们在持续的格物致知中更好认识各种文明的价值，让教育为文明传承和创造服务。我们要大力发展科技事业，通过科技进步和创新，认识自我，认识世界，改造社会，使人们在持续的天工开物中更好掌握科技知识和技能，让科技为人类造福。我们要大力推动文化事业发展，通过文化交流，沟通心灵，开阔眼界，增进共识，让人们在持续的以文化人中提升素养，让文化为人类进步助力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，就是要实现国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福，既深深体现了今天中国人的理想，也深深反映了中国人自古以来不懈追求进步的光荣传统。, 实现中国梦，是物质文明和精神文明均衡发展、相互促进的结果。没有文明的继承和发展，没有文化的弘扬和繁荣，就没有中国梦的实现。中华民族的先人们早就向往人们的物质生活充实无忧、道德境界充分升华的大同世界。中华文明历来把人的精神生活纳入人生和社会理想之中。所以，实现中国梦，是物质文明和精神文明比翼双飞的发展过程。随着中国经济社会不断发展，中华文明也必将顺应时代发展焕发出更加蓬勃的生命力。, 每一种文明都延续着一个国家和民族的精神血脉，既需要薪火相传、代代守护，更需要与时俱进、勇于创新。中国人民在实现中国梦的进程中，将按照时代的新进步，推动中华文明创造性转化和创新性发展，激活其生命力，把跨越时空、超越国度、富有永恒魅力、具有当代价值的文化精神弘扬起来，让收藏在博物馆里的文物、陈列在广阔大地上的遗产、书写在古籍里的文字都活起来，让中华文明同世界各国人民创造的丰富多彩的文明一道，为人类提供正确的精神指引和强大的精神动力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “等闲识得东风面，万紫千红总是春。”明年是教科文组织成立70周年，我相信，在博科娃总干事领导下，教科文组织一定能为推动人类文明交流互鉴、促进世界和平谱写新的篇章。, 谢谢大家。（新华社巴黎3月27日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年03月28日 03 版）, ]",习近平在联合国教科文组织总部的演讲,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24759342
29,127,"[, On February 7, President Xi Jinping was interviewed by Russian TV in Sochi, Russia. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lan Hongguang, People's Network Sochi, Russia, February 8 (Reporter Du Shangze, Chen Xiaowei) State President Xi Jinping was interviewed by Russian TV in Sochi, Russia on the 7th. Comprehensive deepening of reform and development prospects and other questions answered the moderator Brilev's questions. The full text of the question and answer is as follows:, Brilyov: What is your impression of Sochi? What is your comment on the organization of Russia? What do you expect from the performance of the Chinese Olympic delegation at the Sochi Winter Olympics? , Xi Jinping: I am very pleased to come to Sochi at the invitation of President Putin to attend the opening ceremony of the 22nd Winter Olympics. I made a special trip to express the support of the Chinese government and people and myself for hosting the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia. First of all, please convey my sincere regards to the Russian people. , This is my first time in Sochi, but I have heard about Sochi. When I was young, I read the novel ""How Steel Is Made"" many times, and Ostrovsky completed the book in Sochi. Legend has it that Prometheus was once imprisoned in the mountains of Sochi. Sochi retains many remains of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire, which is enough to show that Sochi is a famous cultural city with a long history. Sochi has a special geographical location and is the only region in the northernmost part of the earth that belongs to a subtropical climate. When I came to Sochi this time, what I saw and heard was really well-deserved. There are evergreen seasons, blue sky and blue sea here, and there are good natural alpine snow fields. The people of Sochi are hospitable. Sochi is very energetic and charming, and the Winter Olympics can't be more suitable. After the Sochi Winter Olympics, the reputation here will be greater, more people including Chinese tourists will come here. The Sochi Winter Olympics organization is top-notch. President Putin attaches great importance to it and personally grasps the preparatory work. The Russian people fully support it. I believe that the Sochi Winter Olympics will surely become an unforgettable international sports event and make new contributions to the development of the international Olympic cause. , I have three wishes: One is to wish the opening ceremony tonight is brilliant, the other is to wish athletes from various countries to achieve good results, and the third is to wish Sochi to develop better and more beautiful and friendly cooperation with Chinese cities The relationship is even higher. In 2008, China hosted the Beijing Olympics, realizing the Chinese people's 100-year Olympic dream. China's sports undertakings are constantly developing. The Chinese government attaches great importance to sports undertakings. Our goal is to build a strong sports nation. At the beginning of the last century, China was still in a state of poverty and weakness. The Chinese asked three questions: When can the Chinese send their athletes to the Olympic Games? When will Chinese athletes get an Olympic gold medal? When can China host the Olympic Games? These three wishes have been fully realized by the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The Chinese people are extremely happy, so the Chinese people are fully able to understand and share the joy of the Russian people in hosting the Sochi Winter Olympics. However, there is still a big gap between the level of competition in winter sports in China, especially skiing, compared with the power of ice and snow sports. In recent years, we have made rapid progress in skating events, and have certain strengths in freestyle skiing aerial skills and other projects. This morning, I met some athletes and coaches of the Chinese sports delegation. Chinese athletes have worked hard to participate in the Sochi Winter Olympics. They will carry forward the Olympic spirit, strive to overcome themselves, surpass themselves, and exert their best level. At the same time, Beijing, China, and Zhangjiakou City have formally submitted to the International Olympic Committee for the 2022 Winter Olympics. We are also here to learn from the Russian people, learn from Russian athletes, learn from Russian sports strengths, and host the Winter Olympics to Russia. Will learn from successful practices. , Brilyov: After you took over as president of the country last year, Russia is your first choice for visiting. At the beginning of this year, you still choose Russia as your first choice, and the Russian people are very excited about this. What are your considerations for making such a decision? How do you evaluate the current situation and development prospects of Sino-Russian relations? , Xi Jinping: In March last year, a few days after I was elected President of China, I came to your country for a state visit at the invitation of President Putin. Your country is the first country I visited after I was elected President of China. At that time, I had a long and wide-ranging and candid exchange with President Putin, reached an important consensus on strengthening all-round strategic cooperation between China and Russia, and made a comprehensive plan. Since then, we have met and met four more times. Yesterday, I made a joint review during the meeting with President Putin. We jointly promote the two countries to firmly support each other on major issues involving each other’s core interests, and transform the political advantages of the two countries’ relations into cooperative advantages.Jointly promote the two countries to firmly support each other on major issues involving each other's core interests, transform the political advantages of the two countries' relations into cooperative advantages, and achieve fruitful results in cooperation in various fields such as economic and trade, energy, high technology, local, humanities, and international affairs , Promoted the common development and prosperity of the two countries, and safeguarded international fairness and justice and world peace and stability. I am very satisfied with the achievements made in the development of Sino-Russian relations. The current development of Sino-Russian relations is a period with the strongest foundation, the highest mutual trust, and the greatest regional and international influence. , Relatives are getting closer and closer, and friends are getting closer. Holding the Winter Olympics is a happy event in Russia and a grand event for the International Olympic Movement. China and Russia are good neighbors, good friends, and good partners. President Putin and I are old friends. According to the Chinese tradition, neighbors and friends have happy events at home, and of course they have to come to Hexi to join in the celebration with the Russian people. , Yesterday, I once again held cordial and friendly talks with President Putin. We unanimously decided to ensure that China-Russia relations continue to develop at a high level, increase mutual political support, further promote pragmatic cooperation, and expand strategic cooperation in international affairs. My visit to Sochi this time marks a good start in the development of Sino-Russian relations this year. , Brileyov: The Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passed a decision on a number of major issues in the comprehensive deepening of reform. What is your ruling philosophy? What are the key areas for China's next reform? What do you think of China's development prospects? , Xi Jinping: This is a major issue related to China's development. In 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China started the process of China's reform and opening up. It has been more than 35 years since then and has achieved world-renowned achievements. However, we have to move on. We put forward the goal of ""two hundred years"". At present, economic globalization is developing rapidly, competition for comprehensive national strength is becoming more fierce, and the international situation is complex and changeable. We believe that China must seize opportunities, meet challenges, and achieve new and greater development by fundamentally relying on reform and opening up. Moving forward in fierce international competition is like sailing against the current. Now, compared with the past, the breadth and depth of China's reforms have greatly expanded. To advance the reform, the top-level design must be strengthened. In November last year, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made an overall plan for comprehensively deepening reforms, and proposed a road map and timetable for reforms, covering 15 areas and more than 330 major reform initiatives, including economic, political, cultural, Various aspects of society, ecological civilization and party building. The march of reform has already sounded. Our overall goal is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and to advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities. In order to concentrate our efforts to promote reforms, we established the Central Leading Group for Comprehensive Deepening Reform, with me as the team leader. The task is to unify the deployment and coordination of some major issues, and then break down the work tasks and implement them one by one. I call this ""one-point deployment, nine-point implementation."" It is no easy task to deepen reform in a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion. After more than 30 years of reforms in China, China has entered the deep water zone. It can be said that the easy and joyous reforms have been completed, the delicious meat has been eaten, and the rest are hard to eat. This requires us to be courageous and steady. Be courageous, even if the reform is difficult, we must move forward, dare to take responsibility, dare to bite the hard bones, dare to involve the dangerous beaches. To be steady, that is, the direction must be accurate, and the driving must be stable, especially not to make subversive mistakes. , I have full confidence in China's development prospects. Why are you confident? The most fundamental reason is that after long-term exploration, we have found a correct development path that suits China's national conditions. As long as we rely on the more than 1.3 billion Chinese people and firmly take our own path, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles. Continue to achieve new results and finally achieve the goals we have established. The Communist Party of China insists on governing for the people. The people's longing for a better life is our goal. In summary, my ruling philosophy is to serve the people and take up the responsibilities that should be undertaken. , Brilyov: You have been China's president for almost a year. How do you feel about leading a country as big as China? What are your personal hobbies? What are your favorite sports? , Xi Jinping: China has a territory of 9.6 million square kilometers, 56 ethnic groups, and a population of more than 1.3 billion. The level of economic and social development is not high, and the people’s living standard is not high. Governing such a country is not easy. Must be down to earth. I have worked in different places in China for a long time, and I know that China has great differences in various levels from east to west and from local to central. Therefore, as a leader in China, on the basis of clarifying the situation, it is necessary to make overall plans and balance, highlight the key points, and drive the overall situation. SometimesToo. Therefore, as a leader in China, on the basis of clarifying the situation, we must make overall plans and balance, highlight the key points, and drive the overall situation. Sometimes, we must focus on the larger and the smaller, and the larger and the smaller. The small band is big and the small is big. The image says that it requires ten fingers to play the piano. As the leader of the country, the people put me on such a job, I must always put the people at the highest position in my heart, bear in mind that the responsibility is heavier than Mount Tai, and always keep the safety and security of the people in mind, work hard, and stay dead In the public, always with the people's hearts and minds, with the people share the same hardships and struggles with the people. When it comes to hobbies, I personally like reading, watching movies, traveling, and walking. You know, to take on a job like this, I basically have no time for myself. During the Spring Festival this year, China had a song called ""Where did the time go"". For me, the question is where did my personal time go? Of course, they are all taken up by work. Now, what I can often do is read, reading has become a way of life for me. Reading can make people keep their vitality, make people inspired by wisdom, and make people nourish the noble spirit. For example, I have read many works by Russian writers, such as Krylov, Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Nekrasov, Chernyshev I remember very well many of the wonderful chapters and plots in the books of Skies, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Sholokhov. When it comes to sports, I like swimming, climbing and other sports. I learned swimming when I was four or five years old. I also like football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, martial arts and other sports. In ice and snow projects, I love watching ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, and snow tricks. Especially for ice hockey, this sport requires not only individual strength and skills, but also teamwork and collaboration. It is a very good sport. , ""People's Daily"" (01 February 2014, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping interviewed by Russian TV,3563,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-02-09,"[,  , 2月7日，国家主席习近平在俄罗斯索契接受俄罗斯电视台专访。　　新华社记者 兰红光摄, 人民网俄罗斯索契2月8日电 （记者杜尚泽、陈效卫）国家主席习近平7日在俄罗斯索契接受俄罗斯电视台专访，就索契冬奥会、中俄关系、中国全面深化改革和发展前景等问题回答了主持人布里廖夫提问。答问全文如下：, 布里廖夫：您对索契的印象如何？对俄方组织工作有何评价？对中国奥运代表团参加索契冬奥会的表现有何期待？, 习近平：很高兴应普京总统邀请来到索契，出席第二十二届冬奥会开幕式。我专程来，就是要表达中国政府和人民以及我本人对俄罗斯举办索契冬奥会的支持。首先，请转达我对俄罗斯人民的诚挚问候。, 这是我第一次来索契，但我对索契早有所闻。我年轻时多次读过《钢铁是怎样炼成的》这本小说，奥斯特洛夫斯基就是在索契完成了这部著作。传说普罗米修斯曾经被禁锢在索契的群山之中，索契保留着不少罗马帝国、拜占庭帝国的遗迹，这足以说明索契是一个历史悠久的文化名城。, 索契地理位置特殊，是地球最北端唯一属于亚热带气候的地区。这次来索契，所见所闻，果然名不虚传。这里四季常绿，蓝蓝的天，蓝蓝的海，有很好的天然高山雪场。索契人民热情好客。索契很有活力，很有魅力，举办冬奥会再适合不过了。索契冬奥会之后，这里的名声会更大，更多的人包括中国游客会慕名而来。, 索契冬奥会组织工作是一流的。普京总统高度重视，亲自抓筹备工作，俄罗斯人民全力支持。我相信，索契冬奥会一定会成为一次难忘的国际体育盛会，为国际奥林匹克事业发展作出新的贡献。, 我有三个祝愿：一是祝愿今晚的开幕式精彩纷呈，二是祝愿各国运动员取得好成绩，三是祝愿索契发展得越来越好，越来越美丽，同中国城市间的友好合作关系更上一层楼。, 2008年，中国举办了北京奥运会，实现了中国人民的百年奥运梦。中国体育事业不断发展，中国政府高度重视体育事业，我们的目标是建设体育强国。上个世纪初，中国还处在积贫积弱的状态，中国人就提出了三个问题，即中国人什么时候能够派运动员去参加奥运会？中国运动员什么时候能够得到一块奥运金牌？中国什么时候能够举办奥运会？这3个愿望，到2008年北京奥运会成功举办，已经全部实现了。中国人民感到无比高兴，因此中国人民也完全能够理解和分享俄罗斯人民对举办索契冬奥会的喜悦心情。, 中国冬季运动项目特别是滑雪项目竞技水平同冰雪运动强国相比还有较大差距。近些年，我们在滑冰项目上进步较快，在自由式滑雪空中技巧等项目上具备一定实力。今天上午，我见了中国体育代表团部分运动员、教练员。中国运动员为参加索契冬奥会做了艰苦训练，他们会发扬奥林匹克精神，努力战胜自我、超越自我，发挥自己的最好水平。, 同时，中国北京市联合张家口市已经向国际奥委会正式提出申办2022年冬奥会，我们也是来向俄罗斯人民学习的，向俄罗斯运动员学习，向俄罗斯的体育强项学习，向俄罗斯举办冬奥会的成功做法学习。, 布里廖夫：去年您就任国家主席后，出访首选国家就是俄罗斯，今年新年伊始，您出访仍首选俄罗斯，对此俄罗斯人民倍感振奋。请问您作出这样的决定有何考虑？您如何评价中俄关系现状及发展前景？, 习近平：去年3月，我在当选中国国家主席几天后，就应普京总统邀请来到贵国进行国事访问，贵国是我当选中国国家主席后第一个访问的国家。那次，我同普京总统进行了长时间的议题广泛、坦诚深入的交流，就加强中俄全方位战略协作达成重要共识，作出全面规划。此后我们又4次会晤和见面。昨天，我同普京总统会晤时共同作了回顾。我们共同推动两国在涉及彼此核心利益的重大问题上相互坚定支持，把两国关系的政治优势转化为合作优势，双方经贸、能源、高技术、地方、人文、国际事务等各领域合作取得丰硕成果，促进了两国共同发展繁荣，维护了国际公平正义和世界和平稳定。我对中俄关系发展取得的成果十分满意。当前中俄关系发展是基础最牢、互信最高、地区和国际影响最大的一个时期。, 亲戚越走越亲，朋友越走越近。举办冬奥会是俄罗斯的喜事，也是国际奥林匹克运动的盛事。中俄是好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴，我和普京总统是老朋友了。按照中国人的传统，邻居和朋友家里办喜事，当然要来贺喜，同俄罗斯人民共襄盛举。, 昨天，我同普京总统再次举行了亲切友好的会谈。我们一致决定，要确保中俄关系继续在高水平发展，加大相互政治支持，深入推进务实合作，拓展在国际事务中的战略协作。我这次索契之行，标志着今年中俄关系发展已经开了个好头。, 布里廖夫：中共十八届三中全会通过了关于全面深化改革若干重大问题的决定，您本人担任全面深化改革领导小组组长。请问您的执政理念是什么？中国下一步改革重点领域是什么？您如何看待中国的发展前景？, 习近平：这是关系中国发展的重大问题。1978年，中共十一届三中全会开启了中国改革开放进程，至今已经35年多了，取得了举世瞩目的成就。但是，我们还要继续前进。我们提出了“两个一百年”的奋斗目标。当前，经济全球化快速发展，综合国力竞争更加激烈，国际形势复杂多变，我们认为，中国要抓住机遇、迎接挑战，实现新的更大发展，从根本上还要靠改革开放。在激烈的国际竞争中前行，就如同逆水行舟，不进则退。, 现在，同过去相比，中国改革的广度和深度都大大拓展了。要把改革推向前进，必须加强顶层设计。去年11月，中共十八届三中全会就全面深化改革作出总体部署，提出了改革的路线图和时间表，涉及15个领域、330多项较大的改革举措，包括经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明和党的建设等各个方面。改革的进军号已经吹响了。我们的总目标就是完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化。, 为了集中力量推进改革，我们成立了中央全面深化改革领导小组，由我本人担任组长，任务就是统一部署和协调一些重大问题，再把工作任务分解下去逐一落实。我把这叫作“一分部署，九分落实”。, 在中国这样一个拥有13亿多人口的国家深化改革，绝非易事。中国改革经过30多年，已进入深水区，可以说，容易的、皆大欢喜的改革已经完成了，好吃的肉都吃掉了，剩下的都是难啃的硬骨头。这就要求我们胆子要大、步子要稳。胆子要大，就是改革再难也要向前推进，敢于担当，敢于啃硬骨头，敢于涉险滩。步子要稳，就是方向一定要准，行驶一定要稳，尤其是不能犯颠覆性错误。, 我对中国发展前景充满信心。为什么有信心？最根本的原因是，经过长期探索，我们已经找到一条适合中国国情的正确发展道路，只要我们紧紧依靠13亿多中国人民，坚定不移走自己的路，我们就一定能战胜一切艰难险阻，不断取得新的成绩，最终实现我们确立的目标。, 中国共产党坚持执政为民，人民对美好生活的向往就是我们的奋斗目标。我的执政理念，概括起来说就是：为人民服务，担当起该担当的责任。, 布里廖夫：您担任中国国家主席快一年了，领导中国这么大的国家，您的感受是什么？您个人有哪些爱好？最喜欢哪些体育运动？, 习近平：中国有960万平方公里国土，56个民族，13亿多人口，经济社会发展水平还不高，人民生活水平也还不高，治理这样一个国家很不容易，必须登高望远，同时必须脚踏实地。我曾在中国不同地方长期工作，深知中国从东部到西部，从地方到中央，各地各层级方方面面的差异太大了。因此，在中国当领导人，必须在把情况搞清楚的基础上，统筹兼顾、综合平衡，突出重点、带动全局，有的时候要抓大放小、以大兼小，有的时候又要以小带大、小中见大，形象地说，就是要十个指头弹钢琴。, 作为国家领导人，人民把我放在这样的工作岗位上，我就要始终把人民放在心中最高的位置，牢记责任重于泰山，时刻把人民群众的安危冷暖放在心上，兢兢业业，夙夜在公，始终与人民心心相印、与人民同甘共苦、与人民团结奋斗。, 谈到爱好，我个人爱好阅读、看电影、旅游、散步。你知道，承担我这样的工作，基本上没有自己的时间。今年春节期间，中国有一首歌，叫《时间都去哪儿了》。对我来说，问题在于我个人的时间都去哪儿了？当然是都被工作占去了。现在，我经常能做到的是读书，读书已成了我的一种生活方式。读书可以让人保持思想活力，让人得到智慧启发，让人滋养浩然之气。比如，我读过很多俄罗斯作家的作品，如克雷洛夫、普希金、果戈里、莱蒙托夫、屠格涅夫、陀思妥耶夫斯基、涅克拉索夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基、托尔斯泰、契诃夫、肖洛霍夫，他们书中许多精彩章节和情节我都记得很清楚。, 说到体育活动，我喜欢游泳、爬山等运动，游泳我四五岁就学会了。我还喜欢足球、排球、篮球、网球、武术等运动。冰雪项目中，我爱看冰球、速滑、花样滑冰、雪地技巧。特别是冰球，这项运动不仅需要个人力量和技巧，也需要团队配合和协作，是很好的运动。, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年02月09日 01 版）, ]",习近平接受俄罗斯电视台专访,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/24303725
30,146,"[, Dear Prime Minister Abbot, Dear Speaker of Bishop House, Dear Speaker of Parry, Dear Mr. Shawton, Leader of the Labor Party, Dear Senators and Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: ,   Hello everyone! On this sunny day in the southern hemisphere, I feel very honored to have the opportunity to come to the Australian Federal Parliament to meet you. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends here, and through you to all Australian people! , 　　 I came to Australia this time at the invitation of Governor Cosgrove and Prime Minister Abbott to pay a state visit to Australia and attend the ninth summit of the G20 leaders in Brisbane. As the host, Australia hosted a fruitful and unforgettable summit of leaders of the Group of Twenty, which embodies Australia’s important position and influence in international and regional affairs. I congratulate Australia for the success of the meeting! , 　　 This is the fifth time I set foot on this ancient and vibrant Australian continent. Since 1988, I have visited five states and two regions except Tasmania, and have fond memories of Australia. I am very impressed by the unique look of kangaroos, the laid-back koala, the white clouds and the flock of sheep, the original Sydney Opera House, and the vast expanse of wilderness. Wherever I went, I saw the deep friendship of the Australian people towards the Chinese people. , 　　 Australia has a vast territory, rich products, developed economy, diverse culture and unique scenery. Australia is not only a ""country riding on a sheep's back"" and ""a country sitting on a minecart"", but also a dynamic, innovative country that has produced many world-renowned scientists and made outstanding contributions to the progress of human civilization. Many important inventions that are closely related to human life, such as wireless networks, refrigerators, and ultrasonic scanners, are all produced by Australian scientists. The ""Water Cube"" National Swimming Center, one of the main venues for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, is the result of the wisdom of cooperation between Chinese and Australian architects. , 　　 A few days ago, we held a welcome dinner at the ""Water Cube"" for guests attending the 22nd APEC Informal Leaders' Meeting. The ingenuity and ingenious ideas of the ""Water Cube"" still amazed everyone. , 　　 I admire the innovative spirit of the Australian people and sincerely wish Australia a better future and a happier people. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Although China and Australia are far apart, the friendly exchanges between the two countries have a long history. Since the beginning of the 19th century, many Chinese have come to Australia across the ocean. They gradually integrated into the local society and made important contributions to the development of Australia. In the first half of the last century, during the two world wars, the people of China and Australia fought side by side to jointly safeguard world peace and human justice. , 　　 In 1972, China and Australia established diplomatic relations and opened a new chapter in the history of friendly cooperation between the two countries. Today, high-level and high-level exchanges between the two countries have become more frequent, and more than 30 pairs of intergovernmental consultation and dialogue mechanisms have been established. The regular exchange mechanism between the legislative bodies of the two countries has worked well, providing an important platform for the two parties to exchange experiences in governance. In particular, the economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have achieved remarkable results. Now, the bilateral trade volume has increased from 86 million US dollars at the beginning of the establishment of diplomatic relations to 136.4 billion US dollars in 2013. China has been Australia’s largest trading partner for 5 consecutive years; The scale continues to expand, and China has become Australia's largest source of overseas students and tourism income. The two countries have cooperated well in multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Group of 20, and have conducted close coordination and communication on major international and regional issues. In 2013, the establishment of a strategic partnership between China and Australia became another milestone in the development of bilateral relations. , 　　 Today, we are very pleased to invite Professor Marklin of Griffith University. In 1964, Professor Marklin went to teach in China for the first time. Over the past half century, Professor Marklin has visited China more than 60 times. While experiencing the development and progress of China, he has worked tirelessly to introduce China and the world to China. It is particularly worth mentioning that Professor Marklin’s son Stephen was the first Australian citizen born in China since the founding of the People’s Republic of China. It can be said that Professor Marklin, with unremitting efforts and sincere enthusiasm, has built a bridge between the people of the two countries. In September this year, Professor Marklin won the ""Friendship Award"" of the Chinese government. I want to express my sincere gratitude to you and many Australians for your contribution to China-Australia friendship! , 　　 ""The vast sea, not the first-class home."" It is the two countriesAnd many Australians have expressed their sincere gratitude for their contribution to China-Australia friendship! , 　　 ""The vast sea is not the first-class home."" It is the constant mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries that converge into a sea of ​​friendly relations between China and Australia. I deeply feel that the development of China-Australia relations has a solid foundation of public opinion in both countries. , 　　 I look forward to discussing plans for the development of bilateral relations with Australian leaders and friends from all walks of life in the next few days, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship, expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, and drawing a more magnificent blueprint for China-Australia relations. Add new impetus to both parties to realize their respective development strategies. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 At present, the Chinese people are making unremitting efforts to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese dream is to achieve national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness. Our development goal is that by 2020, our GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will double that of 2010, and we will build a well-off society in an all-round way, and build a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century. In order to realize the Chinese dream, we will comprehensively deepen reform and opening up, comprehensively promote the rule of law, continuously promote modernization, and continuously improve people's living standards. , 　　How does China develop? What kind of country will China develop? I believe everyone here is interested in this issue, just as many people in the world are interested in this issue.　　 Regarding these two issues, there are divergent opinions in the international community. Some fully affirm China, some have full confidence in China, some worry about China, and others are always uncomfortable with China. I think this is also normal. China is a big country with a population of more than 1.3 billion. It is a big man in the crowd. Other people must see how the big man goes and moves. Will he hit himself or block? Does your own way take up your own territory? Here, I would like to make a few observations on issues of concern to everyone. , 　　 First, China insists on peaceful development and is determined not to waver. The Chinese people cherish peace, and the Chinese nation has always been a peace-loving nation. Since ancient times, the Chinese have always advocated the idea of ​​""taking peace as the key"" and ""doing what you don't want, do not impose on others"". China has suffered more than 100 years of turmoil and war since modern times. The development of the country and the happiness of the people cannot be discussed at all. The Chinese people will never impose the tragic experience they have suffered on other countries and nations. , 　　 China needs peace. China most needs a harmonious and stable domestic environment and a peaceful international environment. Any turbulence and war are not in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. Although China is a big man, the ancestors of China recognized the truth that ""a country is big, but a belligerent will perish"" more than 2,000 years ago. Throughout history, any country trying to achieve its own development goals by force will eventually fail. Those empire in history that have become indelible now have become a cloud of glory. This is an unbreakable truth. , 　　 China maintains peace. There is only one trend in the world today, and that is peace, development, cooperation and a win-win situation. Both history and reality prove that those who follow the trend prosper and those who go against the trend die. Peace is precious, and peace also needs to be maintained. Factors that undermine peace are always worthy of vigilance. Everyone only wants to enjoy peace, and is unwilling to maintain it, then peace will cease to exist. The Chinese people adhere to the path of peaceful development and sincerely hope that all countries in the world will follow the path of peaceful development, jointly deal with various factors that threaten and destroy peace, and work together to build a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity. , 　　 Second, China adheres to common development and its philosophy will not be shaken. In today's world, people of all countries are a community of shared destiny. Markets, funds, resources, information, and talents are highly globalized. Only if the world develops can countries develop; if only countries develop, the world can develop. ,   The more the merrier. China is willing to develop and prosper together with other countries. China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, adhere to the correct concept of justice and benefit, develop an open economic system, and strengthen and expand mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries in the world. China's development will never come at the expense of the interests of other countries, and will never do anything that harms others. , 　　 China's development is an important opportunity for all countries in the world. China is accelerating new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and new economic growth points will continue to emerge. The market of China's population of more than 1.3 billion has immeasurable potential. China's economic restructuring and industrial optimization and upgrading will generate huge demand. In the next five years, China is expected to import more than US$10 trillion in commodities, the cumulative scale of foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and the number of outbound tourists will exceed 500 million. This will provide international and regional partners with a broader market, more sufficient capital, richer products, and more valuable opportunities for cooperation. , 　　 Third, China insists on promotingInternational and regional partners provide a broader market, more sufficient capital, richer products, and more valuable opportunities for cooperation. Third, China insists on promoting Asia-Pacific cooperation and development, and its policy will not be shaken. Asia-Pacific is where China lives and lives. Without peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, China's stability and development cannot be guaranteed. China’s great achievements in reform and opening up over the past 30 years are not only the result of its own hard work, but also benefit from an inclusive and open Asia-Pacific environment. China sincerely hopes to work with the countries of the region to make a big cake of interests and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. , 　　 China will adhere to be good neighbors and neighbors, practice the concept of sincerity and benefit, advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asian security concept, and strive to make its own development better benefit neighboring and Asia-Pacific countries. China will work with other countries to make good use of platforms such as APEC, East Asia Summit, and ASEAN Regional Forum to promote the completion of negotiations on regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements, accelerate the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and promote the Asia-Pacific region. Development and security are mutually reinforcing and complement each other. , 　　 maritime passage is the main way for China's foreign trade and energy imports, and ensuring the freedom and safety of maritime navigation is of vital importance to China. The Chinese government is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with relevant countries, jointly safeguard the freedom of maritime navigation and the safety of passages, and build a maritime order that is peaceful, peaceful and win-win.　　 The Chinese people will unswervingly safeguard the core interests involving China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. The UN Charter and the basic norms of international relations are applicable to all countries. We advocate that all countries are equal regardless of wealth, strength, weakness, or size. This refers not only to equality in rights and interests, but also equality in international rules. , 　　 China has always insisted on peacefully handling disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests with relevant countries through dialogue and consultation. China has completely resolved the land border issue with 12 of the 14 neighboring countries through friendly consultations, and this practice will continue. China is sincerely willing to work with countries in the region to build a harmonious Asia-Pacific and prosper Asia-Pacific. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China has always regarded Australia as an important partner. During my visit, the two sides decided to promote China-Australia relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership and announced the substantial conclusion of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement negotiations. These two important achievements will help us to push China-Australia relations up to the top. , 　　 Standing at a new starting point and height, we should strengthen dialogue and exchange, deepen political mutual trust, expand pragmatic cooperation with a longer-term vision, a broader mind, and a greater ambition, and work together to achieve peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region . To this end, we must focus our efforts on the following aspects. , 　　 First, enhance mutual understanding and be a sincere partner of mutual trust. Both China and Australia are important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. They have no historical complaints and fundamental conflicts of interest. They are committed to seeking peace, promoting cooperation and seeking development, and working hard to maintain and promote regional and world stability and prosperity. We can go beyond partnerships in business and be strategic partners who advocate common ideas. , 　　 There is a proverb in Australia: ""Staring at the sun will not be disturbed by shadows."" China and Australia have different historical cultures, social systems, and development levels. It is normal to have differences. The key is to firmly grasp the correct direction of the development of relations between the two countries, communicate frankly, seek common ground while reserving differences, and act in the same direction, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and properly handle differences. As long as we always focus on the long-term and overall situation, increase positive factors, and eliminate negative interference, the road of China-Australia's development of a comprehensive strategic partnership will become broader and broader. , 　　 Second, deepen pragmatic cooperation and be a close partner for mutual benefit and win-win results. China and Australia have strong economic complementarities and a high degree of development strategy fit. China is comprehensively deepening reforms, and the Australian government is also building a diversified and sustainable growth pattern. The two sides can deeply connect their respective development strategies to achieve complementary advantages and establish a closer and mutually beneficial cooperative relationship. , 　　 The conclusion of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will provide a higher platform and better system guarantee for the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. The two sides should consolidate traditional strength cooperation such as energy resources, accelerate the cultivation of new cooperation growth points such as infrastructure construction, agriculture and animal husbandry, and realize the diversification of economic and trade relations between the two countries. China supports Australia's implementation of the northern development plan and welcomes Australian companies to actively participate in China's western development strategy. The two sides should also deepen two-way investment cooperation to provide a fairer and more convenient environment for investment between the enterprises of the two countries. , 　　 Third, close humanistic exchanges and be close friends. For this big tree of China-Australia relations to be leafy forever, it is necessary to deepen the foundation of cultural exchanges. Both China and Australia should create more conditions to promote exchanges and cooperation in the fields of education, culture, science and technology, tourism, etc.Foundation. Both China and Australia should create more conditions to promote exchanges and cooperation in education, culture, science and technology, tourism, and other fields, as well as build a bridge of understanding and friendship between the people of China and Australia.　　 China is willing to work with Australia to implement the ""New Colombo Plan"" in China and expand the two-way exchange of students between the two countries. Both sides should make full use of the China-Australia high-level dialogue to promote dialogue and exchanges between the two governments and all sectors of society. Both sides should also make good use of new platforms such as the China-Australia Heads of State Exchange and Cooperation Mechanism and the Sydney Chinese Cultural Center to enhance mutual understanding and understanding, so that the people of both countries will become supporters, builders and beneficiaries of China-Australia friendly cooperation. , 　　 Fourth, strengthen strategic communication and be a good neighbor in the same boat. Australia has an important influence in the Asia-Pacific region. China welcomes Australia to play a more constructive role in the region. We should promote regional countries to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, speed up infrastructure interconnection, improve the level of monetary and financial cooperation, promote trade liberalization, expand people-to-people exchanges, provide more complete hardware and a more convenient soft environment for regional economic integration, and drive the region. National industrial structure adjustment and upgrading. , 　　Oceania is a natural extension of the ancient Maritime Silk Road. China is open to Australia’s participation in the construction of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. China and Australia should strengthen cooperation in humanitarian disaster relief, counter-terrorism, maritime security and other aspects, and jointly respond to various regional security challenges. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Tomorrow, I will go to Tasmania, so that I will travel all the states in Australia, and my knowledge of Australia can be more abundant. Shortly before coming, my wife and I received a letter from 16 lovely primary school students in Skokie-Oakburn School, Tasmania. They described the unique properties and beautiful scenery there, with a special mention of Tahun The air path, the Grand Canyon, and of course the ""Tasmanian Devil"", also said that if you go to the Grand Canyon, you may also find beautiful peacock feathers. This filled me with curiosity. , 　　 I look forward to tomorrow's trip to Tasmania and look forward to meeting these children. I believe that Tasmania will also leave a good impression on me and deepen my knowledge and understanding of Australia as a great country. , 　　 ""Concentricity and solidarity, always the same, this gentleman's friend."" I believe that with the joint efforts of China and Australia, the friendship between the people of China and Australia can completely cross the mountains and the sea, just like the Uluru giant rock towering in central Australia They are fearless of wind and rain and stand forever, just like the Great Wall in northern China, which stretches for generations. , 　　 Australians often say that without a dream, you lose your direction. On the road to realizing their dreams, the people of China and Australia let us join hands and shoulder to shoulder to jointly create a better future for China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership and jointly write a new chapter of peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region! , 　　 Thank you! , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, November 17th), 　　 ""People's Daily""

尊敬的阿博特总理，, 尊敬的毕晓普众议长，, 尊敬的帕里参议长，, 尊敬的工党领袖肖顿先生，, 各位参、众议员，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　大家好！在这南半球阳光明媚的日子里，有机会来到澳大利亚联邦议会同大家见面，我感到十分荣幸。首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位朋友，并通过你们向全体澳大利亚人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 　　我这次来澳大利亚，是应科斯格罗夫总督和阿博特总理的邀请，对澳大利亚进行国事访问，并出席在布里斯班举行的二十国集团领导人第九次峰会。澳大利亚作为东道主，主办了一届富有成果、令人难忘的二十国集团领导人峰会，体现了澳大利亚在国际和地区事务中的重要地位和影响。我对澳方成功办会表示祝贺！, 　　这是我第五次踏上这片古老而又充满活力的澳洲大陆。1988年以来，我访问过除塔斯马尼亚州之外的五个州和两个地区，对澳大利亚有着美好的回忆。长相独特的袋鼠，憨态可掬的考拉，白云朵朵的羊群，独具匠心的悉尼歌剧院，辽阔无垠的旷野，给我留下了深刻印象。所到之处，我都看到了澳大利亚人民对中国人民的深厚情谊。, 　　澳大利亚幅员辽阔，物产丰饶，经济发达，文化多元，风景独特。澳大利亚不仅是个“骑在羊背上的国家”和“坐在矿车上的国家”，更是一个富有活力、开拓创新的国家，产生了许多蜚声世界的科学家，为人类文明进步作出突出贡献。许多同人类生活息息相关的重要发明，比如无线网络、电冰箱、超声波扫描仪等都出自澳大利亚科学家之手。2008年北京奥运会主场馆之一“水立方”国家游泳中心，就是中澳建筑师合作智慧的结晶。, 　　几天前，我们在“水立方”为参加亚太经合组织第二十二次领导人非正式会议的来宾举行了欢迎晚宴，“水立方”的匠心独具、巧妙构思依然让大家赞叹不已。, 　　我对澳大利亚人民的创新精神表示钦佩，衷心祝愿澳大利亚的未来更加美好、人民更加幸福。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国和澳大利亚虽然远隔重洋，但两国友好交往源远流长。自19世纪初开始，就有许多中国人漂洋过海来到澳大利亚。他们逐步融入当地社会，为澳大利亚发展作出重要贡献。上世纪前半段，在两次世界大战中，中澳两国人民并肩战斗，共同维护了世界和平和人类正义。, 　　1972年，中澳建立外交关系，掀开了两国友好合作新的历史篇章。如今，两国高层及各级别交往日益频繁，建立了30多对政府间磋商对话机制；两国立法机构定期交流机制运行良好，为双方交流治国理政经验提供了重要平台。特别是两国经济文化交流合作成绩斐然，现在，双边贸易额已从建交之初的0.86亿美元增长至2013年的1364亿美元，中国连续5年是澳大利亚第一大贸易伙伴；两国人员往来规模不断扩大，中国成为澳大利亚第一大海外留学生和旅游收入来源国。两国在联合国、亚太经合组织、二十国集团等多边机制中合作良好，就重大国际和地区问题开展了密切协调和沟通。2013年，中澳建立战略伙伴关系，成为两国关系发展的又一里程碑。, 　　今天，我们很高兴地邀请到了格里菲斯大学的马克林教授。1964年，马克林教授首次赴华任教。半个世纪来，马克林教授60多次访华，在亲历中国发展进步的同时，孜孜不倦向澳大利亚和世界介绍中国的真实情况。特别值得一提的是，马克林教授的儿子斯蒂芬是中华人民共和国成立以来在中国出生的第一个澳大利亚公民。可以说，马克林教授以不懈努力和真挚热情，为两国人民相知相亲搭建起一座桥梁。今年9月，马克林教授荣获中国政府“友谊奖”。我要对你及众多澳大利亚人士为中澳友好作出的贡献，表示诚挚的谢意！, 　　“大海之阔，非一流之归也。”正是两国人民源源不断的相互理解和友谊，汇聚成了中澳友好关系之海。我深深感到，中澳关系发展在两国都有深厚的民意基础。, 　　我期待着在今后几天里，同澳大利亚领导人和各界朋友共商两国关系发展大计，增进相互了解和友谊，拓展各领域互利合作，为中澳关系不断前行绘制更加宏伟的蓝图，为双方实现各自发展战略增添新的动力。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　当前，中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而不懈奋斗。中国梦就是要实现国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福。我们的发展目标是，到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番、全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。为了实现中国梦，我们将全面深化改革开放、全面推进依法治国，不断推进现代化建设，不断提高人民生活水平。, 　　中国如何发展？中国发展起来了将是一个什么样的国家？相信在座各位对这个问题都有兴趣，正像世界上很多人都对这个问题有兴趣一样。, 　　关于这两个问题，国际社会众说纷纭，有的对中国充分肯定，有的对中国充满信心，有的对中国忧心忡忡，有的则总是看不惯中国。我想，这也正常，中国是一个拥有13亿多人口的大国，是人群中的大块头，其他人肯定要看看大块头要怎么走、怎么动，会不会撞到自己，会不会堵了自己的路，会不会占了自己的地盘。这里，我愿就大家关心的问题谈几点看法。, 　　第一，中国坚持和平发展，决心不会动摇。中国人民珍惜和平，中华民族历来是爱好和平的民族。中国人自古崇尚“以和为贵”“己所不欲，勿施于人”等思想。中国近代以后遭遇了100多年的动荡和战火，国家发展、人民幸福根本无从谈起，中国人民绝不会将自己曾经遭受过的悲惨经历强加给其他国家和民族。, 　　中国需要和平。中国最需要和谐稳定的国内环境与和平安宁的国际环境，任何动荡和战争都不符合中国人民根本利益。中国虽然是个大块头，但两千多年前中国的先人就认识到“国虽大，好战必亡”的道理。纵观历史，任何国家试图通过武力实现自己的发展目标，最终都是要失败的，历史上那些不可一世的帝国如今都成了过眼烟云。这是一条颠扑不破的真理。, 　　中国维护和平。当今世界的潮流只有一个，那就是和平、发展、合作、共赢。历史和现实都证明，顺潮流者昌，逆潮流者亡。和平是宝贵的，和平也是需要维护的，破坏和平的因素始终值得人们警惕。大家都只想享受和平，不愿意维护和平，那和平就将不复存在。中国人民坚持走和平发展道路，也真诚希望世界各国都走和平发展这条道路，共同应对威胁和破坏和平的各种因素，携手建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。, 　　第二，中国坚持共同发展，理念不会动摇。当今世界，各国人民是一个休戚与共的命运共同体，市场、资金、资源、信息、人才等等都是高度全球化的。只有世界发展，各国才能发展；只有各国发展，世界才能发展。, 　　众人拾柴火焰高。中国愿意同各国共同发展、共同繁荣。中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚持正确义利观，发展开放型经济体系，全方位加强和拓展同世界各国的互利合作。中国发展绝不以牺牲别国利益为代价，绝不做损人利己的事情。, 　　中国发展对世界各国是重要机遇。中国正在加快推进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化，新的经济增长点将不断涌现。中国13亿多人口的市场具有不可估量的潜力，中国经济结构调整和产业优化升级将产生巨大需求。未来5年，中国预计将进口超过10万亿美元的商品，对外投资规模累计将超过5000亿美元，出境旅游人数将超过5亿人次。这将为国际和地区伙伴提供更广阔的市场、更充足的资本、更丰富的产品、更宝贵的合作契机。, 　　第三，中国坚持促进亚太合作发展，政策不会动摇。亚太是中国安身立命之所。没有亚太地区和平和繁荣，中国的稳定和发展就得不到保障。中国改革开放30多年来取得巨大成就，既是自身努力奋斗的结果，也得益于一个包容开放的亚太环境。中国真心希望同地区国家一道做大利益蛋糕，实现互利共赢。, 　　中国将坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴，践行亲诚惠容的理念，倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，努力使自身发展更好惠及周边及亚太国家。中国将同各国一道，用好亚太经合组织、东亚峰会、东盟地区论坛等平台，推动区域全面经济伙伴关系协定谈判如期完成，加快推进丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路建设，推动亚太地区发展和安全相互促进、相得益彰。, 　　海上通道是中国对外贸易和进口能源的主要途径，保障海上航行自由安全对中方至关重要。中国政府愿同相关国家加强沟通和合作，共同维护海上航行自由和通道安全，构建和平安宁、合作共赢的海洋秩序。, 　　对涉及中国主权、安全、领土完整的核心利益，中国人民也会坚定不移加以维护。联合国宪章和国际关系基本准则对所有国家都是适用的，我们主张各国不论贫富、强弱、大小一律平等，这不仅是指权益上的平等，也是指在国际规则上的平等。, 　　中国一贯坚持通过对话协商以和平方式处理同有关国家的领土主权和海洋权益争端。中国已经通过友好协商同14个邻国中的12个国家彻底解决了陆地边界问题，这一做法会坚持下去。中国真诚愿意同地区国家一起努力，共同建设和谐亚太、繁荣亚太。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国始终视澳大利亚为重要伙伴。我这次访问期间，双方决定把中澳关系提升为全面战略伙伴关系，并宣布实质性结束中澳自由贸易协定谈判。这两项重要成果将有助于我们推动中澳关系百尺竿头、更进一步。, 　　站在新的起点和高度上，我们应该以更长远的眼光、更宽阔的胸襟、更远大的抱负，加强对话交流，深化政治互信，拓展务实合作，携手共同实现亚太地区和平、稳定、繁荣。为此，我们要着重从以下几个方面作出努力。, 　　第一，增进彼此理解，做相互信任的真诚伙伴。中澳同为亚太重要国家，没有历史积怨和根本利益冲突，都致力于求和平、促合作、谋发展，努力做地区和世界稳定和繁荣的维护者、促进者。我们完全可以超越生意上的伙伴关系，做倡导共同理念的战略伙伴。, 　　澳大利亚有句谚语：“盯着太阳就不会被阴影困扰。”中国同澳大利亚历史文化、社会制度、发展水平不同，存在分歧很正常。关键是要牢牢把握两国关系发展的正确方向，坦诚沟通、求同存异、相向而行，尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切，妥善处理分歧。只要我们始终着眼长远和大局，增加积极因素，排除消极干扰，中澳发展全面战略伙伴关系之路就会越走越宽广、越走越敞亮。, 　　第二，深化务实合作，做互利共赢的紧密搭档。中澳经济互补性强，发展战略契合度高。中国正在全面深化改革，澳大利亚政府同样在构建多元化、可持续增长格局。双方可以将各自发展战略深度对接，实现优势互补，建立更加紧密的互利合作关系。, 　　中澳自由贸易协定的达成将为两国经贸合作提供更高的平台和更完善的制度保障。双方要巩固能源资源等传统强项合作，加快培育基础设施建设、农牧业等新的合作增长点，实现两国经贸关系多元化。中方支持澳大利亚实施北部大开发计划，也欢迎澳大利亚企业积极参与中国西部大开发战略。双方还应该深化双向投资合作，为两国企业投资提供更公平便利的环境。, 　　第三，密切人文交流，做心心相印的知己朋友。中澳关系这棵大树要永远枝繁叶茂，必须扎深人文交流的根基。中澳双方应该创造更多条件，促进教育、文化、科技、旅游等领域以及地方交流合作，在中澳两国人民之间架起更多理解和友谊的桥梁。, 　　中方愿同澳方一道，在华实施好“新科伦坡计划”，扩大两国学生双向交流。双方要充分利用中澳高级别对话，促进两国政府和社会各界对话和交流。双方还要用好中澳省州负责人交流合作机制、悉尼中国文化中心等新平台，增进相互了解和认知，使两国民众都成为中澳友好合作的支持者、建设者、受益者。, 　　第四，加强战略沟通，做同舟共济的和睦邻居。澳大利亚在亚太具有重要影响，中方欢迎澳方在本地区发挥更大建设性作用。我们应该推动地区国家加强宏观经济政策协调，加快基础设施互联互通，提升货币金融合作水平，促进贸易自由化，扩大人文交流，为区域经济一体化提供更完善的硬件和更便利的软环境，带动域内国家产业结构调整升级。, 　　大洋洲地区是古代海上丝绸之路的自然延伸，中方对澳大利亚参与21世纪海上丝绸之路建设持开放态度。中澳两国应该加强人道主义救灾、反恐、海上安全等方面合作，共同应对地区各类安全挑战。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　明天，我将去塔斯马尼亚州，这样我将走遍澳大利亚所有的州，我对澳大利亚的认识就可以更加丰富。来之前不久，我和夫人收到了塔斯马尼亚州斯科奇—欧克伯恩学校16名可爱的小学生的来信，他们在信中描绘了那里的独特物产和美丽风光，特别提到了塔胡恩空中栈道、大峡谷，当然还有“塔斯马尼亚恶魔”，还说如果去大峡谷的话还有可能捡到美丽的孔雀羽毛。这让我充满了好奇。, 　　我期待着明天的塔斯马尼亚州之行，期待着同这些孩子见面。我相信，塔斯马尼亚州也一定会给我留下美好的印象，并加深我对澳大利亚这个伟大国家的认识和了解。, 　　“同心而共济，始终如一，此君子之朋也。”我相信，在中澳双方共同努力下，中澳两国人民友谊完全能够跨越高山和大海，如同耸立在澳大利亚中部的乌鲁鲁巨岩一样不畏风雨、屹立长存，如同横亘在中国北方的万里长城一样绵延不断、世代相传。, 　　澳大利亚人常说，没有梦想就会失去方向。在中澳两国人民实现各自梦想的道路上，让我们手拉手、肩并肩，共同开创中澳全面战略伙伴关系更加美好的未来，共同谱写亚太地区和平、稳定、繁荣的新篇章！, 　　谢谢各位！, 　　（新华社堪培拉11月17日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2014年11月18日 02 版）, ]",习近平：携手追寻中澳发展梦想

31,147,"[,, Seeking lasting development and building an Asia-Pacific dream, ——A speech at the opening ceremony of the APEC Business Leaders Summit, (November 9, 2014, National Convention Center), President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, November 9, The 2014 APEC Business Leaders Summit was held at the Beijing National Convention Center. President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech titled ""Pursue Sustainable Development and Build an Asia-Pacific Dream"".　　 Xinhua News Agency reporter 　 Rao Aimin, Dear President of Chile, Ms. Bachelet:, Dear Director General of the World Trade Organization, Mr. Azevedo:, Ladies and gentlemen, friends:, Hello everyone! Welcome friends from the Asia-Pacific business community! Last year we met in Beijing in Bali, and I am very happy to reunite with you today. , According to China's solar terms, the winter was set up just two days ago. The turn of autumn and winter is a colorful season. ""Shan Mingshui comes frost at night, and the trees are deep red and light yellow."" The yellow of ginkgo and the red of maple leaves add color to the ancient capital of Beijing. After a year of hard work, China and APEC members together look forward to reaping fruit at the upcoming 22nd informal leader meeting. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The Asia-Pacific region brings together ancient civilizations and emerging forces, creating a long history and a splendid culture. The people here are hardworking, the mountains and rivers here are beautiful, the development momentum here is strong, and the future prospects here are bright. Today’s Asia-Pacific, which accounts for 40% of the world’s population, 57% of the total economy, and 48% of the total trade, is the region with the fastest global economic development, the greatest potential, and the most active cooperation. It is the world’s economic recovery and development Important engine. Today's Asia-Pacific has entered a new stage of development, with high levels of capital, technology, information, and personnel movement. The Asia-Pacific market has begun to take shape, various regional cooperation mechanisms are booming, and new initiatives and new ideas are constantly emerging. The status of Asia-Pacific today is rising in the world pattern. A new round of global scientific and technological revolution, industrial revolution, and energy revolution are poised to take off. The Asia-Pacific economies are increasingly interconnected. The necessity and urgency of regional economic integration have become more prominent. Today's Asia-Pacific is also facing challenges in all aspects. The subsequent impact of the international financial crisis has not been completely eliminated, the recovery of some economies is still fragile, the task of improving the quality and efficiency of the Asia-Pacific economy is arduous, and the task of converting old and new growth points is arduous. The direction and focus of accelerating the process of regional economic integration are different, and various regional free trade arrangements have emerged, which has led to confusion in some aspects of choice. The future of Asia-Pacific is at a critical intersection. Should we continue to lead the world and create a better future, or should we slow down and wait to be surpassed? Is it deepening the integration process, or is it falling into a fragmented vortex? Should we practice the concept of openness and tolerance and jointly create the Asia-Pacific century, or should the body have entered the 21st century and the mode of thinking is still in the past? The big era needs a big pattern, and the big pattern requires a lot of wisdom. The prospects for Asia-Pacific development depend on today’s decisions and actions. We have a responsibility to create and realize the Asia-Pacific dream for the people of this region. This dream is to uphold the spirit of the Asia-Pacific family and the community of destiny, conform to the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation, and win-win, and work together to prosper and progress in the Asia-Pacific region; that is, to continue to lead the world’s development and make greater contributions to human well-being; Make the economy more dynamic, trade more free, more convenient investment, smoother roads, closer people-to-people interaction; that is, let the people live a more peaceful and prosperous life, let the children grow up better, work better, live Better. , We must make greater efforts to achieve this goal. -We will work together to build an Asia-Pacific partnership of mutual trust, tolerance, cooperation and win-win results. Like-minded, like partners. Seeking common ground while reserving differences is also a partner. The road is better when there are more friends. We should communicate through honesty and in-depth communication to increase trust and resolve doubts; we should uphold the concept of harmony and differentness, respect each other’s choice of development path; we should adhere to mutually beneficial cooperation, give full play to our respective advantages, and promote common development; Make the cake of Asia-Pacific development bigger and promote the prosperity of Asia-Pacific. , ——We must work together to create an open Asia-Pacific economic structure. Openness brings progress, and closure leads to backwardness. Regardless of past, present and future, opening up is an important prerequisite for sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific region. It is necessary to deepen the internal opening, let the vitality of labor, knowledge, technology, management, capital burst out, and also expand the opening to the outside world, transforming the diversity and differences of members into development potential and motivation; it is also necessary to enhance regional economic integration To a new height, to start the process of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, we must also adhere to the concept of open regionalismDevelopment potential and motivation; we must not only promote regional economic integration to a new height, start the process of the Asia-Pacific free trade zone, but also adhere to the concept of open regionalism, promote the construction of a new open economic system and regional cooperation framework, and keep the door of the Asia-Pacific region Open to the world. -We must constantly explore new drivers of economic growth. Life never cares for those who are conservative and satisfy the status quo, and leave more opportunities to those who are brave and good at reform and innovation. In the face of a new round of global growth, reformers advance, but innovators are strong, but reform and innovators win. We must show the courage to be the first in the world, forge ahead with reforms, encourage innovation, actively explore new roads and new models suitable for our own development needs, and constantly seek new growth points and driving forces. , ——We must carefully draw up a blueprint for all-round interconnection. Asia-Pacific connectivity and infrastructure construction are not only the prerequisites for regional economic integration, but also the long-term development of all parties. We must work together to build an Asia-Pacific interconnection pattern that covers both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Through hardware interconnection, we will shorten the distance between economies and pave the way for connecting the Asia-Pacific and the accessible world. Through software interconnection, we will strengthen policies, laws, and regulations. Connect and integrate to create a convenient and efficient Asia-Pacific supply chain; promote the friendly exchange of people through the interconnection of personnel exchanges, so that trust and friendship can take root. Based on the above, China has identified ""to build a future-oriented Asia-Pacific partnership"" as the theme of this year's APEC meeting, and will promote regional economic integration, promote economic innovation, development, reform and growth, and strengthen all-round infrastructure and interconnection. Construction is a key issue. , I firmly believe that the broad consensus reached on the above issues at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting will inject new impetus into the sustained development of Asia-Pacific. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Last year, at the APEC Business Leaders Summit, I introduced to my friends confidence in China's economic development and determination to continue deepening reforms. A year has passed, and I am very happy, and my point of view was confirmed. In the first three quarters of this year, China's GDP increased by 7.4% year-on-year, and all major economic indicators are within a reasonable range. At present, China's economy maintains a stable development trend, urban employment continues to increase, and residents' income, business benefits, and fiscal income have been increasing steadily. More importantly, there have been positive changes in structural adjustment, significant growth in the service industry, and continuous expansion of domestic demand. , China's economy has shown a new normal, with several main characteristics. One is to change from high-speed growth to medium-high growth. Second, the economic structure has been continuously optimized and upgraded. The tertiary industry and consumer demand have gradually become the main body. The gap between urban and rural areas has gradually narrowed. The proportion of residents’ income has risen. The third is from element-driven, investment-driven to innovation-driven. The new normal will bring new development opportunities to China. First, under the new normal, although China's economic growth has slowed, the actual increase is still considerable. After more than 30 years of rapid growth, China's economy has changed from the past. In 2013, the increment of China's economy is equivalent to the total economic volume of 1994, and it can be ranked 17th in the world. Even with a growth rate of about 7%, both speed and volume are among the best in the world. Secondly, under the new normal, China's economic growth has become more stable and its growth momentum has become more diverse. Some people worry that China's economic growth will decline further and whether it can climb the slope. There are risks, but they are not so terrible. The resilience of the Chinese economy is the most powerful support for preventing risks. We have innovated the ideas and methods of macro-control, and with the currently determined strategy and the policy reserves we have, we have the confidence and ability to cope with various possible risks. We are working together to promote new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, which is conducive to resolving various ""growth troubles."" The Chinese economy relies more on domestic consumer demand to avoid the external risks of relying on exports. Thirdly, under the new normal, China's economic structure has been optimized and upgraded, and its development prospects have become more stable. In the first three quarters of this year, the contribution rate of China’s final consumption to economic growth was 48.5%, surpassing investment; the value added of the service industry accounted for 46.7%, which continued to exceed the secondary industry; the growth rate of high-tech industries and equipment manufacturing was 12.3%, respectively And 11.1%, significantly higher than the average industrial growth rate; energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 4.6%. These data show that China's economic structure is undergoing profound changes, with better quality and better structure. Fourthly, under the new normal, the Chinese government has vigorously simplified administration and decentralization, and market vitality has been further released. In short, it is to let go of the ""invisible hand"" of the market and make good use of the ""visible hand"" of the government. For example, we have reformed the enterprise registration system. In the first three quarters, there were 9.2 million new registered market entities in the country, and the number of new enterprises increased by more than 60% compared with last year.We have reformed the enterprise registration system. In the first three quarters, there were 9.2 million new registration entities in the country, and the number of new enterprises increased by more than 60% compared with last year. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that the new normal is also accompanied by new contradictions and new problems, and some potential risks have gradually surfaced. The key to whether or not we can adapt to the new normal lies in comprehensively deepening reform. , I said at the summit of business leaders last year that China's reform has entered a period of tough time and deep water. We must dare to bite hard bones, dare to be involved in dangerous beaches, and dare to attack the persistent diseases that have accumulated for many years. The Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made overall arrangements for comprehensively deepening reforms, involving more than 330 major reform measures in 15 areas. At present, these reform measures are being implemented one by one. Opening the bow did not look back, we will unswervingly push the reform cause deeper. Therefore, if we comprehensively deepen reforms, we must stimulate the vitality of the market. Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurial spirit. To stimulate market vitality, it is necessary to put the right to be put in place, the environment created should be created, and the rules formulated should be set up so that entrepreneurs can use them. We emphasize the need to better play the role of the government, more from managers to servicers, to serve enterprises, and to promote economic and social development. As we comprehensively deepen reform, we must broaden the way for innovation. If innovation is the new engine for China's development, then reform is an essential igniter, and more effective measures must be taken to launch the innovation engine at full speed. We are committed to giving play to the original driving force of innovation, support more innovative enterprises and vibrant SMEs, promote the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, and form new growth points and driving forces as soon as possible. To deepen reforms in an all-round way, we must promote high-level opening up. China is committed to building a new open economic system, relaxing market access, expanding the opening up of the service industry, including the capital market, and expanding the opening of the inland and border areas; committed to establishing an open Asia-Pacific economic pattern of development, innovation, growth linkage, and integration of interests to promote Initiating the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area process this year, formulating the APEC road map to promote the realization of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area; actively exploring the management model of pre-access national treatment plus a negative list, exploring new ways and accumulating new experiences for China's comprehensive deepening of reform and opening up. To deepen reforms in an all-round way, we must improve the well-being of the people and promote social fairness and justice. In the final analysis, all reforms are for the people and for the people to live a good life. China implements a more proactive employment and entrepreneurship policy to promote the continuous increase in people's income. In the first three quarters of this year, 10.82 million people were employed in cities and towns in China, the consumer price index rose by 2.1% year-on-year, and the per capita income of urban and rural residents increased by 6.9% and 9.7%, respectively. China is building a more equitable and sustainable social security system, improving its public service system, and innovating its social governance system. In short, the comprehensive deepening reform we are pursuing is not only a liberation of social productive forces, but also a liberation of social vitality, and will surely become a powerful driving force for China's economic and social development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The interconnectedness and interdependence between the Chinese economy and the Asia-Pacific and world economies are constantly deepening. China will concentrate on doing its own thing well, and also strive to make its own development better for the Asia-Pacific and the world. China will pursue the neighboring foreign policy of being good neighbors and partners, and the neighboring foreign policy of good neighbors, rich neighbors, and peaceful neighbors, and implement the neighboring diplomacy of pro, honest, benefit, and tolerance, and is willing to live in harmony with all neighboring countries. According to statistics, from 2005 to the first half of 2014, 6 of the top 10 economies that absorbed Chinese investment were APEC members, with a total value of more than US$200 billion. It is expected that China's foreign investment will reach US$1.25 trillion in the next 10 years. In the next five years, China’s imports of goods will exceed 10 trillion US dollars, and the number of outbound tourists will exceed 500 million. The opportunities and benefits that China's development brings to the Asia-Pacific and the world are enormous, and the business opportunities it brings are enduring and unlimited. As China's overall national strength rises, China has the ability and willingness to provide more public goods to Asia-Pacific and the world, especially to propose new initiatives and new ideas to promote the in-depth development of regional cooperation. China is willing to work with other countries to promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”, participate more deeply in the regional cooperation process, and make new contributions to Asia-Pacific interconnection, development and prosperity. , Here, I am happy to announce to you that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has made a substantial step forward in its preparations. The founding member states signed an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding in Beijing not long ago. China will also invest US$40 billion to establish the Silk Road Fund to provide investment and financing support for related projects such as infrastructure construction, resource development, and industrial cooperation in countries along the “Belt and Road”. We are willing to work with you to promote the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to be put into operation as soon as possible and become aProvide investment and financing support for related projects. We are willing to work with you to promote the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to be put into operation as soon as possible and become a new platform for all parties to cooperate in the fields of interconnection and finance. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The business sector is an important driving force for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the world. It has played a positive role in promoting economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and leading the recovery of the world economy. It has also made significant contributions to China's reform, opening up, and modernization. China welcomes people in the Asia-Pacific business community to actively participate in China's reform, opening up, and modernization process, and to share the fruits of China's reform and development. As the economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region continues to be pragmatic and deepening, some cooperation initiatives of the APEC are bearing fruit, bringing many tangible benefits to enterprises and companies in the region. I hope you will actively use your unique advantages in information, technology, capital, etc., combined with the actual needs of the business community, to make suggestions on major issues such as promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepening regional economic integration, and the long-term development of APEC. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Looking ahead, the development and prosperity of the world and the Asia-Pacific are facing unprecedented historical opportunities as well as more complex risk challenges. All parties in the Asia-Pacific region should follow the tide of the times and work together to build a future-oriented Asia-Pacific partnership, and jointly contribute to the grand regional cooperation and create a better future for Asia-Pacific! , Finally, I wish this meeting a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th), ""People's Daily"" (November

（2014年11月9日，国家会议中心）, 中华人民共和国主席　习近平, 11月9日，2014年亚太经合组织工商领导人峰会在北京国家会议中心举行，国家主席习近平出席开幕式并发表题为《谋求持久发展 共筑亚太梦想》的主旨演讲。　　新华社记者　饶爱民摄, 尊敬的智利总统巴切莱特女士：, 尊敬的世界贸易组织总干事阿泽维多先生：, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！欢迎亚太工商界的朋友们！去年我们在巴厘岛相约北京，今天同大家重聚，我感到十分高兴。, 按照中国的节气，两天前刚刚立冬。秋冬之交是个多彩的季节。“山明水净夜来霜，数树深红出浅黄。”银杏的黄，枫叶的红，给北京这座古都增添了色彩。经过一年辛勤耕耘，中国和亚太经合组织成员一道，期待在即将举行的第二十二次领导人非正式会议上收获硕果。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 亚太地区汇集了古老文明和新兴力量，创造了悠久历史和灿烂文化。这里的人民勤劳，这里的山河美丽，这里的发展动力强劲，这里的未来前景光明。, 今天的亚太，占世界人口的40%、经济总量的57%、贸易总量的48%，是全球经济发展速度最快、潜力最大、合作最为活跃的地区，是世界经济复苏和发展的重要引擎。, 今天的亚太，已进入新的发展阶段，资金、技术、信息、人员流动达到高水平，亚太大市场初具轮廓，各种区域合作机制蓬勃发展，新倡议新设想不断涌现。, 今天的亚太，在世界格局中的地位不断上升。全球新一轮科技革命、产业革命、能源革命蓄势待发，亚太经济体相互联系日益紧密，区域经济一体化的必要性和迫切性更加凸显。, 今天的亚太，也面临方方面面的挑战。国际金融危机后续影响尚未完全消除，一些经济体的复苏仍然脆弱，亚太经济提高质量和效益任务艰巨，新旧增长点转换任务艰巨。加快区域经济一体化进程方向和重点不一，各种区域自由贸易安排纷纷涌现，导致一些方面面临选择的困惑。, 亚太的未来，正处在关键的路口。是继续引领世界、创造美好未来，还是放慢脚步、等待被人超越？是深化一体化进程、还是陷入碎片化漩涡？是践行开放包容理念、共同开创亚太世纪，还是身体已进入21世纪而思维模式还停留在过去？, 大时代需要大格局，大格局需要大智慧。亚太发展前景取决于今天的决断和行动。我们有责任为本地区人民创造和实现亚太梦想。这个梦想，就是坚持亚太大家庭精神和命运共同体意识，顺应和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流，共同致力于亚太繁荣进步；就是继续引领世界发展大势，为人类福祉作出更大贡献；就是让经济更有活力，贸易更加自由，投资更加便利，道路更加通畅，人与人交往更加密切；就是让人民过上更加安宁富足的生活，让孩子们成长得更好、工作得更好、生活得更好。, 我们要为实现这一目标作出更大努力。, ——我们要共同建设互信、包容、合作、共赢的亚太伙伴关系。志同道合，是伙伴。求同存异，也是伙伴。朋友多了，路才好走。我们应该通过坦诚深入沟通，增信释疑；应该秉持和而不同理念，尊重彼此对发展道路的选择；应该坚持互利合作，充分发挥各自优势，促进共同发展；应该变赢者通吃为各方共赢，共同做大亚太发展的蛋糕，共同促进亚太大繁荣。, ——我们要携手打造开放型亚太经济格局。开放带来进步，封闭导致落后。无论过去、现在、将来，开放都是亚太实现可持续增长的重要前提。既要深化对内开放，让劳动、知识、技术、管理、资本的活力竞相迸发，也要扩大对外开放，把成员多样性和差异性转化为发展潜力和动力；既要把区域经济一体化提升到新高度，启动亚太自由贸易区进程，也要坚持开放的区域主义理念，推动建设开放型经济新体制和区域合作构架，让亚太的大门始终向全世界敞开。, ——我们要不断发掘经济增长新动力。生活从不眷顾因循守旧、满足现状者，而将更多机遇留给勇于和善于改革创新的人们。在新一轮全球增长面前，惟改革者进，惟创新者强，惟改革创新者胜。我们要拿出敢为天下先的勇气，锐意改革，激励创新，积极探索适合自身发展需要的新道路新模式，不断寻求新增长点和驱动力。, ——我们要精心勾画全方位互联互通蓝图。亚太互联互通和基础设施建设不仅是实现区域经济一体化的前提，更事关各方长远发展。我们要共同致力于构建覆盖太平洋两岸的亚太互联互通格局，通过硬件的互联互通，拉近各经济体的距离，为联接亚太、通达世界铺设道路；通过软件的互联互通，加强政策、法律、规制的衔接和融合，携手打造便利、高效的亚太供应链；通过人员往来的互联互通，促进人民友好往来，让信任和友谊生根发芽。, 基于上述，中国将“共建面向未来的亚太伙伴关系”确定为今年亚太经合组织会议的主题，并将推动区域经济一体化，促进经济创新发展、改革与增长，加强全方位基础设施与互联互通建设作为重点议题。, 我坚信，亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议在上述问题上达成的广泛共识，将为亚太持久发展注入新的动力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 去年，在亚太经合组织工商领导人峰会上，我向朋友们介绍了对中国经济发展的信心和继续深化改革的决心。一年过去了，我很高兴，我当时的观点得到了印证。, 今年前3个季度，中国国内生产总值同比增长7.4%，各项主要经济指标处于合理区间。当前，中国经济保持稳定发展态势，城镇就业持续增加，居民收入、企业效益、财政收入平稳增长。更重要的是，结构调整出现积极变化，服务业增长势头显著，内需不断扩大。, 中国经济呈现出新常态，有几个主要特点。一是从高速增长转为中高速增长。二是经济结构不断优化升级，第三产业、消费需求逐步成为主体，城乡区域差距逐步缩小，居民收入占比上升，发展成果惠及更广大民众。三是从要素驱动、投资驱动转向创新驱动。新常态将给中国带来新的发展机遇。, 第一，新常态下，中国经济增速虽然放缓，实际增量依然可观。经过30多年高速增长，中国经济体量已今非昔比。2013年一年中国经济的增量就相当于1994年全年经济总量，可以在全世界排到第十七位。即使是7%左右的增长，无论是速度还是体量，在全球也是名列前茅的。, 第二，新常态下，中国经济增长更趋平稳，增长动力更为多元。有人担心，中国经济增速会不会进一步回落、能不能爬坡过坎。风险确实有，但没那么可怕。中国经济的强韧性是防范风险的最有力支撑。我们创新宏观调控思路和方式，以目前确定的战略和所拥有的政策储备，我们有信心、有能力应对各种可能出现的风险。我们正在协同推进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化，这有利于化解各种“成长的烦恼”。中国经济更多依赖国内消费需求拉动，避免依赖出口的外部风险。, 第三，新常态下，中国经济结构优化升级，发展前景更加稳定。今年前3个季度，中国最终消费对经济增长的贡献率为48.5%，超过投资；服务业增加值占比46.7%，继续超过第二产业；高新技术产业和装备制造业增速分别为12.3%和11.1%，明显高于工业平均增速；单位国内生产总值能耗下降4.6%。这些数据显示，中国经济结构正在发生深刻变化，质量更好，结构更优。, 第四，新常态下，中国政府大力简政放权，市场活力进一步释放。简言之，就是要放开市场这只“看不见的手”，用好政府这只“看得见的手”。比如，我们改革了企业登记制度，前3个季度全国新登记注册市场主体920万户，新增企业数量较去年增长60%以上。, 同时，我们也清醒认识到，新常态也伴随着新矛盾新问题，一些潜在风险渐渐浮出水面。能不能适应新常态，关键在于全面深化改革的力度。, 我在去年工商领导人峰会上说过，中国改革已进入攻坚期和深水区，我们要敢于啃硬骨头，敢于涉险滩，敢于向积存多年的顽疾开刀。中国共产党十八届三中全会就全面深化改革作出总体部署，涉及15个领域、330多项重大改革举措。目前，这些改革举措正在逐项落实。开弓没有回头箭，我们将坚定不移把改革事业推向深入。, 我们全面深化改革，就要激发市场蕴藏的活力。市场活力来自于人，特别是来自于企业家，来自于企业家精神。激发市场活力，就是要把该放的权放到位，该营造的环境营造好，该制定的规则制定好，让企业家有用武之地。我们强调要更好发挥政府作用，更多从管理者转向服务者，为企业服务，为推动经济社会发展服务。, 我们全面深化改革，就要为创新拓宽道路。如果说创新是中国发展的新引擎，那么改革就是必不可少的点火器，要采取更加有效的措施把创新引擎全速发动起来。我们致力于发挥创新驱动的原动力作用，更多支持创新型企业、充满活力的中小企业，促进传统产业改造升级，尽快形成新增长点和驱动力。, 我们全面深化改革，就要推进高水平对外开放。中国致力于构建开放型经济新体制，放宽市场准入，扩大服务业包括资本市场的对外开放，扩大内陆沿边开放；致力于建立发展创新、增长联动、利益融合的开放型亚太经济格局，推动在今年启动亚太自由贸易区进程，制定亚太经合组织推动实现亚太自由贸易区路线图；积极探索准入前国民待遇加负面清单的管理模式，为中国全面深化改革开放探索新途径、积累新经验。, 我们全面深化改革，就要增进人民福祉、促进社会公平正义。一切改革归根结底都是为了人民，是为了让老百姓过上好日子。中国实行更加积极的就业创业政策，推动人民收入持续提高。今年前3个季度，中国城镇新增就业1082万人，居民消费价格指数同比上涨2.1%，城镇和农村居民人均收入分别增长6.9%和9.7%。中国正在建设更加公平可持续的社会保障制度，健全公共服务体系，创新社会治理体制。, 总之，我们正在推行的全面深化改革，既是对社会生产力的解放，也是对社会活力的解放，必将成为推动中国经济社会发展的强大动力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国经济同亚太和世界经济的相互联系、相互依存不断加深。中国将集中精力做好自己的事情，也要努力使自身发展更好惠及亚太和世界。中国将奉行与邻为善、以邻为伴的周边外交方针和睦邻、富邻、安邻的周边外交政策，贯彻亲、诚、惠、容的周边外交理念，愿意同所有邻国和睦相处。, 据统计，从2005年到2014年上半年，吸收中国投资排名前10位的经济体中有6个是亚太经合组织成员，总额超过2000亿美元。预计未来10年中国对外投资将达1.25万亿美元。今后5年，中国进口商品累计将超过10万亿美元，出境旅游等人数将超过5亿人次。中国发展给亚太和世界带来的机会和利益是巨大的，带来的商机是持久和无限的。, 随着综合国力上升，中国有能力、有意愿向亚太和全球提供更多公共产品，特别是为促进区域合作深入发展提出新倡议新设想。中国愿意同各国一道推进“一带一路”建设，更加深入参与区域合作进程，为亚太互联互通、发展繁荣作出新贡献。, 在此，我高兴地向大家宣布，亚洲基础设施投资银行筹建工作已经迈出实质性一步，创始成员国不久前在北京签署了政府间谅解备忘录。中国还将出资400亿美元成立丝路基金，为“一带一路”沿线国家基础设施建设、资源开发、产业合作等有关项目提供投融资支持。我们愿同大家一道努力，推动亚洲基础设施投资银行及早投入运作，成为各方在互联互通、金融等领域开展合作的新平台。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 工商界是亚太和世界经济发展的重要推动力量，为促进亚太经济增长、引领世界经济复苏发挥了积极作用，也为中国改革开放和现代化事业作出了重大贡献。中国欢迎亚太工商界人士积极参与中国改革开放和现代化进程，共享中国改革发展带来的成果。, 随着亚太区域经济合作不断走向务实和深化，亚太经合组织的一些合作倡议正在开花结果，为本地区企业和公司带来很多实实在在的好处。希望大家积极利用自身在信息、技术、资金等方面的独特优势，结合工商界实际需求，就推动贸易和投资自由化便利化、深化区域经济一体化、亚太经合组织长远发展等重大问题建言献策。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 展望未来，世界和亚太的发展繁荣面临前所未有的历史机遇，也面临更为复杂的风险挑战。亚太各方应该顺应时代大潮，携手共建面向未来的亚太伙伴关系，共襄区域合作盛举，共创亚太美好未来！, 最后，预祝这次会议取得圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京11月9日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年11月10日 02 版）,

32,148,"[, Dear Vice President Ansari, Dear President Badiya,, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends:, Namaste! Hello everyone! I am very pleased to meet you here at the invitation of the World Affairs Commission of India. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to the great Indian people! To those who have contributed to the friendly cooperation between China and India for a long time, we pay high tribute and heartfelt thanks! , In 1997, I visited your country and left a very good impression. After a lapse of 17 years, I once again set foot on this vibrant land. I have witnessed the great development achievements of the Indian people and experienced the spirit of diligence and progress of the Indian people. The development of India today is indeed ""unbelievable"" as people say. India is a magical and colorful country that has conceived ancient civilizations that have spanned thousands of years. It has gone through a long and tortuous road of independence and self-improvement, and has embarked on a process of revival full of hope. Coming to India is like walking into a colorful historical promenade. It was magnificent and magnificent yesterday, exciting today, and exciting tomorrow. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the Indian people are more confident in the future, and the international community is more expectant of India. This time, I exchanged in-depth views with Prime Minister Modi on bilateral relations and major issues of common concern, and reached broad consensus. Many of our ideas coincide. We unanimously agreed to enrich the connotation of the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries and establish a closer development partnership. , Mr. Deng Xiaoping said that only when both China and India have developed will there be a real ""Asian century."" Mr. Nehru also said that coming together in India and China is a major event in Asia and the world. As the two largest countries in Asia, China and India bear historical responsibilities and missions of the times in maintaining peace and stability in Asia and achieving prosperity and rejuvenation in Asia. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The people of China and India live next to each other. There has been a relationship of mutual learning in ancient times. Mahatma Gandhi said: ""China and India are the same fellows in the same boat and suffering."" Prime Minister Modi told me that China and India are ""two bodies, one spirit"". These words illustrate the internal connection between the common essence of peace between two great civilizations of China and India and the connection of the soul. , China and India have textual history of exchanges that can be tested for more than 2,000 years. The prosperity of Buddhism in the West and the prosperity of Fa in the East are about Buddhism in the history of the exchanges between the peoples of China and India. In 67 AD, Tianzhu monks Kaye Moteng and Zhu Fran came to Luoyang, China. The translation of the scriptures said that the forty-two chapters translated became the earliest Buddhist scripture translation in the history of Chinese Buddhism. The White Horse Pack Classic and Xuan Zang's westward journey brought Indian culture back to China. Chinese great navigator Zheng He made seven voyages and six arrived in India, bringing China's friendship. Indian song and dance, astronomy, calendar, literature, architecture, sugar-making technology, etc. were introduced into China, and Chinese papermaking, silk, porcelain, tea, music, etc. were introduced into India, becoming a history of interconnection and mutual learning between the two peoples since ancient times. evidence. Since modern times, the people of China and India have sympathized and supported each other in the struggle for national independence and liberation, and jointly promoted the awakening of Asia. India is calling for China to fight against opium, and China is encouraging the Indian independence movement. During the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan, the deeds of the Indian medical aid team in China were very touching. Their distinguished representative, Dr. Ke Dihua, was sleeping in the land of China, and the Chinese people always remembered his noble character. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India in 1950 opened a new chapter in bilateral relations. India was one of the earliest countries to recognize New China, and it was also one of the first to propose the restoration of China’s legal seat in the United Nations. China, India, and Myanmar jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which has made a pioneering move in the history of international relations and is an outstanding contribution of Oriental wisdom to modern civilization. Since the beginning of the new century, China and India have established a strategic partnership for peace and prosperity, and the relationship between the two sides has entered a fast track of development. Over the past 10 years, the bilateral trade volume between China and India has increased more than 20 times, and personnel exchanges have nearly doubled. The breadth and depth of exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have been unprecedentedly expanded. It can be said that the development of relations between the two countries stands at a new historical starting point. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In the era we are in, the international pattern is undergoing unprecedented and profound adjustments. One of the important trends is the continuous rise of Asia’s position in the global pattern. As two important forces in the process of multipolarization in the world, China and India are once again pushed to the forefront of the times as a vital force driving economic growth in Asia and the world. China-India relations are far awayThe two important forces in the process of globalization have once again been pushed to the forefront of the times as a vital force driving economic growth in Asia and the world. China-India relations have gone far beyond the bilateral scope and have wide regional and global influence. China and India work together to benefit both countries, benefit Asia, and benefit the world. To this end, I advocate that China and India should be closer development partners, growth-leading partners, and strategic global partners. First, China and India should be closer development partners and jointly realize national rejuvenation. Development is the biggest common strategic goal of China and India. The top priorities for both China and India are to make their people's lives easier, safer, and happier. We should focus on development, share experience, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and strive to achieve peaceful development, cooperative development, and inclusive development of the two countries. , China is called the ""World Factory"" and India is called the ""World Office"". The two sides should strengthen cooperation to achieve complementary advantages. We want to promote China's opening to the west and India's ""eastward"" policy to achieve docking, to build the world's most competitive production base, the most attractive consumer market, and the most traction growth engine. We also need to expand cooperation in the areas of investment and finance to achieve comprehensive development of practical cooperation between the two sides. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date of the people. Chinese Tai Chi and Indian Yoga, Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine and Indian Ayurveda have striking similarities. The philosophy of life of the people of the two countries has been deeply similar for thousands of years. During this visit, the two sides formulated a China-India cultural exchange plan, the purpose of which is to carry forward the ancient humanistic spirit of the two countries, and to reproduce the glorious scene of exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations of China and India. The two sides have agreed to expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as youth, culture, education, tourism, religion, media, radio, film and television, and local provinces and cities. The Chinese side decided to increase the pilgrimage route through the Nathula Pass to facilitate Indian pilgrims to make pilgrimages to the holy lake of Shenshan in Tibet, China. , I have been interested in Indian civilization since I was a child. The ups and downs of India’s ups and downs have attracted me deeply. I have been interested in the history books about the Ganges civilization, about the Vedic culture, about the peacock dynasty, the Guishuang dynasty, the Kaddu dynasty, the Mughal empire, etc. The history of the Indian colonies and the history of the Indian people’s tenacious struggle for national independence also paid close attention to the thoughts and life of Mahatma Gandhi, hoping to learn from it the development process and spiritual world of a great nation. I have read Tagore's ""Gitanjali"", ""Flying Birds Collection"", ""Garden Collection"", ""Crescent Collection"" and many other poetry collections. Many verses are still fresh in my memory. He wrote, ""If you shed tears because you lost the sun, then you also lost the stars"", ""When we are very humble, it is when we are the closest to greatness"", ""Errors cannot afford failure, but Truth is not afraid of failure"", ""We see the world wrong and say that it deceives us"", ""Life is as bright as summer flowers, death is as quiet as autumn leaves"", etc. These beautiful and philosophical verses are given to me Very deep life enlightenment. Secondly, China and India should be partners in leading growth and join hands to promote the prosperity and rejuvenation of Asia. China and India should become regional development-driven express trains and drive the common development of all countries in the region. Both sides should strive to build consensus on regional cooperation, work with relevant countries to promote the process of regional economic integration and interconnection, accelerate the construction of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, and complete regional comprehensive economic partnership negotiations as soon as possible; to be a double anchor for regional peace and stability and work together Establish an open, transparent, equal and inclusive security and cooperation framework in the Asia-Pacific region to achieve common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. Thirdly, China and India should be global partners for strategic cooperation and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. At present, the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is even stronger. However, unfair and irrational phenomena in international relations are still prominent, global challenges are emerging, and various regional conflicts and local wars are emerging one after another. There is a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. China and India face similar challenges in global affairs, share broad common interests, and also shoulder major responsibilities. , China and India have a combined population of more than 2.5 billion. If China and India speak in one voice, the whole world will listen. If China and India work together, the whole world will pay attention. China and India should strengthen strategic cooperation in global affairs, inherit and carry forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, adhere to sovereign equality, fairness and justice, and common security, adhere to common development, win-win cooperation, tolerance and mutual learning, and safeguard the two countries and the vast majority Common interests of developing countries. China and India should make greater contributions to world economic growth and global governance through their own development, and provide programs that represent the interests of developing countries for global issues such as climate change, food security, energy security, and network security. China is willing to strengthen strategic cooperation with India in multilateral mechanisms such as China, Russia, India, the BRICS, the G20, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China supports India in the United Nations including AnliStrengthen strategic cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as China, Russia, India, the BRICS, the G20, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China supports India’s desire to play a greater role in the United Nations, including the Security Council. , The neighbors inevitably bump into each other. China and India should face squarely the remaining historical issues and strive to find a fair and reasonable solution acceptable to both sides through peaceful and friendly consultations. At the same time, we cannot just focus our attention on differences and ignore friendship and cooperation, nor can we allow the development of the two countries and the overall situation of bilateral relations to be disturbed. I believe that as two ancient civilizations, China and India have the ability and wisdom to walk out of a friendly way of neighboring big countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Many Indian friends are very concerned about China's development and hope that China will develop better. Over the past 30 years of reform and opening up, China's economic and social development has achieved remarkable achievements, people's lives have continued to improve, and all countries in the world have benefited from China's development. We have also noticed that some people in the world have declared that China will follow the old road of ""national power must be hegemonic"" when it develops, posing a ""threat"" to other countries. I want to make it clear to everyone that China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development. The Chinese nation has always loved peace, and the pursuit of peace, harmony and harmony is deeply rooted in the spiritual world of the Chinese nation. Since ancient times, China has advocated ""strength is not stubborn and weak, wealth is not insulting the poor"". The idea that harmony is the most valuable, harmony is different, turning the gods into jade, and the world is the same has been passed down from generation to generation in China. Ancient China used to be a powerful country in the world for a long time, but China spread the concept of peace to the outside world, and exported rich products such as silk, tea, and porcelain. The ""Great Harmony of the World"" advocated by the Chinese nation is the same as the ""One Family of the World"" pursued by the Indian people, the ""Common Love"" admired by the Chinese nation and the ""harmless"" advocated by the Indian people. We all regard ""harmony"" as the road to the world. , I hope all nations can live in peace and harmony. , The Chinese nation has always focused on learning, emphasizing ""exploration and knowledge, thick accumulation and thin hair"", and emphasizing that ""three deeds must be taught by us. Choose the good ones and follow the bad ones,"" and advocate ""Educated, interrogated, thoughtful, discerned, and committed."" The reason why the Chinese nation has endured for thousands of years is precisely because of this learning spirit of seeing one's virtues together. I have always emphasized that China should be a great country to learn from, not to be complacent, not to be arrogant, but to learn with modesty, diligence, and diligence, and constantly gain what it cannot. The Chinese nation has always attached great importance to good-neighborliness, good faith and good-neighborliness. China regards its surroundings as a place to live and prosper, and a foundation for development and prosperity. We put forward the concept of neighboring diplomacy of pro, sincerity, benefit and tolerance, that is, we should sincerely get along with our neighbors and work together to seek development, work together to make the cake of cooperation bigger and share the fruits of development. As a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, China has spent decades to complete the development process that developed countries have traveled for hundreds of years. This is a historic achievement. At the same time, we are soberly aware that China is still the largest developing country in the world and is still in the primary stage of socialism. Although China's economic aggregate is large, divided by more than 1.3 billion people, its per capita GDP is still ranked around the 80th in the world. More than 1.3 billion people have a good life, and long-term hard work is needed. For a long period of time, China's central task is economic construction, and to promote social progress on the basis of economic development. China has set its own development goals. By 2020, the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will double that of 2010, and a well-off society will be fully built. By the middle of this century, a modern, prosperous, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist country will be built. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In order to realize the Chinese dream, China needs a long-term peaceful and stable external environment. Only by following the path of peaceful development can China achieve its own development goals. The Chinese people have experienced a tragic history of frequent wars for more than 100 years since modern times, and they never want such tragedies to be repeated anywhere. ""Do not do what you don't want, do not impose on others."" China's determination to cherish peace, cherish peace and maintain peace is unshakable. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! From Nepal to Maldives, from Afghanistan to Bangladesh, the South Asian people's desire for a better life and the pursuit of national revitalization show the bright future of South Asia's development. I firmly believe that South Asia is a promising and endless subcontinent, and is expected to become the new growth pole of Asia and the world economy. A peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia is in the interests of the countries and peoples of the region and China. China is willing to live in harmony with the countries of South Asia and is willing to contribute to the development of South Asia. China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative is to strengthen the interconnection of countries along the traditional land and sea Silk RoadCountries live in harmony and are willing to contribute to the development of South Asia. China's ""Belt and Road"" initiative is to strengthen the interconnection of countries along the traditional land and sea Silk Road to achieve economic prosperity, trade complementarity, and people's hearts. China hopes to take the ""One Belt, One Road"" as its wings and take off with the South Asian countries. , China and countries in South Asia are important partners. The cooperation between China and South Asia is like a huge treasure waiting to be unearthed. China is willing to work together with South Asian countries to strive to increase the bilateral trade volume to 150 billion US dollars in the next five years, increase Chinese investment in South Asia to 30 billion US dollars, and provide South Asian countries with 20 billion US dollars of preferential loans. China will expand cultural exchanges with South Asian countries. In the next five years, it will provide South Asia with 10,000 scholarships, 5,000 training places, 5,000 youth exchange and training places, and 5,000 Chinese language teachers. China will implement the China-South Asia Science and Technology Partnership Program with South Asian countries, give full play to the role of China-South Asia Expo, and create a new platform for mutually beneficial cooperation. , China is the largest neighboring country in South Asia, and India is the largest country in South Asia. China looks forward to working with India to contribute more to the development of the region and allow the 3 billion people on both sides of the Himalayas to share peace, friendship, stability and prosperity. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! 90 years ago, Tagore, a great Indian poet whom the Chinese people loved, visited China and was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. As soon as he set foot on the land of China, Tagore said: ""I don't know what the reason is, going to China is like returning to my hometown."" When leaving China, he said sadly, ""My heart is here."", Today There were youth representatives from China and India. Young people are the future of China and India and the hope of Asia and the world. Young people have the joys and sorrows of realists, as well as the beliefs and perseverance of idealists. I hope you can draw wisdom from the ancient civilizations of China and India and move forward along the path of pursuing truth. I hope you will strengthen communication between the soul, leave the young heart in China, and the young heart in India. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Finally, what I want to tell my Indian friends is that the Chinese people stress ""to stand by oneself, to stand by oneself, to reach oneself by oneself"". While seeking its own development, China sincerely hopes that India will prosper and prosper, and looks forward to moving forward with India. On the road of the Indian people to achieve development and rejuvenation, the Chinese people are willing to always be with the Indian people. I believe that the people of China and India, which have profoundly affected the development of human civilization, will definitely make new and greater contributions to the development of Asia and the world! , Dhanyavad. Thank you. , (Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 18th), ""People's Daily"" (September 19, 2014, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Working together to pursue the dream of national

纳玛斯代（Namaste）！大家好！非常高兴应印度世界事务委员会邀请，在这里同大家见面。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向伟大的印度人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！向长期以来为中印两国友好合作作出贡献的人士，致以崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢！, 1997年，我曾经访问过贵国，留下了十分美好的印象。时隔17年，再次踏上这片生机勃勃的土地，我又亲眼目睹了印度人民取得的巨大发展成就，亲身感受到印度人民勤勉奋进的精神风貌。今天的印度发展，确实如人们所说的那样，“是令人难以置信的”。, 印度是一个神奇而又多彩的国度，孕育了绵延数千年的古老文明，走过了曲折漫长的独立自强之路，踏上了充满希望的复兴进程。来到印度，就像走进了一条斑斓的历史长廊，昨天恢宏瑰丽，今天令人振奋，明天精彩可期。在莫迪总理领导下，印度人民对未来更加充满信心，国际社会对印度更加充满期待。, 这次来，我同莫迪总理就双边关系和共同关心的重大问题全面深入交换了意见，达成广泛共识，我们的很多想法不谋而合。我们一致同意，充实两国战略合作伙伴关系内涵，建立更加紧密的发展伙伴关系。, 邓小平先生说过，只有中印都发展起来了，才会有真正的“亚洲世纪”。尼赫鲁先生也说过，印中走到一起是亚洲乃至世界的一件大事。作为亚洲最大的两个国家，中印在维护亚洲和平稳定、实现亚洲繁荣振兴方面承担着历史责任和时代使命。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中印两国人民毗邻而居，古有往来互鉴之情，近有患难与共之交，现有共同复兴之业。圣雄甘地说：“中国和印度是同舟共济、患难与共的同路人。”莫迪总理对我说，中印两国是“两个身体，一种精神”。这些话道出了中印两大文明和平向善的共同本质和心灵相通的内在联系。, 中印两国有文字可考的交往史长达2000多年。佛兴西方，法流东国，讲的是中印两国人民交往史上浓墨重彩的佛教交流。公元67年，天竺高僧迦叶摩腾、竺法兰来到中国洛阳，译经著说，译出的四十二章经成为中国佛教史上最早的佛经翻译。白马驮经，玄奘西行，将印度文化带回中国。中国大航海家郑和七次远航、六抵印度，带去了中国的友邦之谊。印度歌舞、天文、历算、文学、建筑、制糖技术等传入中国，中国造纸、蚕丝、瓷器、茶叶、音乐等传入印度，成为两国人民自古以来互联互通、互学互鉴的历史佐证。, 近代以来，中印两国人民在争取民族独立和解放的斗争中彼此同情、相互支持，共同推动了亚洲的觉醒。印度为中国反对鸦片斗争呼号，中国为印度独立运动鼓劲。在中国人民抗日战争期间，印度援华医疗队的事迹感人至深。他们的杰出代表柯棣华大夫长眠于中华大地，中国人民对他的高尚品德永记在心。, 1950年中印建交，掀开了两国关系新篇章。印度是最早承认新中国的国家之一，也是首先提出恢复中国在联合国合法席位的国家之一。中国、印度、缅甸共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，成就了国际关系史上的一个创举，是东方智慧对现代文明的杰出贡献。, 进入新世纪以来，中印两国建立了面向和平与繁荣的战略合作伙伴关系，双方关系进入了发展快车道。10多年来，中印双边贸易额增长了20多倍，人员往来增加了近2倍，两国交流合作的广度和深度都得到了空前扩展。可以说，两国关系发展站在了新的历史起点上。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 我们所处的时代，国际格局正在发生前所未有的深刻调整，其中一个重要趋势就是亚洲在全球格局中的地位不断上升。中印两国作为世界多极化进程中的两支重要力量，作为拉动亚洲乃至世界经济增长的有生力量，又一次被推向时代前沿。中印关系已经远远超出双边范畴，具有广泛的地区和全球影响。中印携手合作，利在两国，惠及亚洲，泽被世界。, 为此，我主张，中印两国要做更加紧密的发展伙伴、引领增长的合作伙伴、战略协作的全球伙伴。, 第一，中印两国要做更加紧密的发展伙伴，共同实现民族复兴。发展是中印两国最大的共同战略目标。中印两国当务之急都是让本国人民生活得更舒心、更安心、更幸福。我们应该聚焦发展、分享经验，深化互利合作，努力实现两国和平发展、合作发展、包容发展。, 中国被称为“世界工厂”，印度被称为“世界办公室”，双方应该加强合作，实现优势互补。我们要推动中国向西开放和印度“东向”政策实现对接，打造世界上最具竞争力的生产基地、最具吸引力的消费市场、最具牵引力的增长引擎。我们还要扩大投资和金融等领域合作，实现双方务实合作全面发展。, 国之交在于民相亲。中国太极和印度瑜伽、中国中医和印度阿育吠陀有惊人的相似之处，两国人民数千年来奉行的生活哲理深度相似。这次访问期间，双方制定了中国—印度文化交流计划，目的就是弘扬两国古代人文精神，重现中印两大文明交流互鉴的盛景。双方已同意拓展青年、文化、教育、旅游、宗教、媒体和广播影视、地方省市等各领域交流合作。中方决定增开经乃堆拉山口的朝圣路线，以便利印度香客赴中国西藏的神山圣湖朝圣。, 对印度文明，我从小就有着浓厚兴趣。印度跌宕起伏的历史深深吸引了我，我对有关恒河文明、对有关吠陀文化、对有关孔雀王朝、贵霜王朝、笈多王朝、莫卧儿帝国等的历史书籍都有涉猎，特别关注印度殖民地历史以及印度人民顽强争取民族独立的斗争史，也十分关注圣雄甘地的思想和生平，希望从中参透一个伟大民族的发展历程和精神世界。泰戈尔的《吉檀迦利》、《飞鸟集》、《园丁集》、《新月集》等诗集我都读过，许多诗句让我记忆犹新。他写道，“如果你因为失去了太阳而流泪，那么你也失去了群星”，“当我们是大为谦卑的时候，便是我们最接近伟大的时候”，“错误经不起失败，但真理却不怕失败”，“我们把世界看错了，反说它欺骗我们”，“生如夏花之灿烂，死如秋叶之静美”，等等，这些优美又充满哲理的诗句给了我很深的人生启迪。, 第二，中印两国要做引领增长的合作伙伴，携手推进亚洲繁荣振兴。中印两国要成为地区驱动发展快车，带动地区各国共同发展。双方要努力凝聚地区合作共识，与相关国家一道推进区域经济一体化和互联互通进程，加快孟中印缅经济走廊建设，早日完成区域全面经济伙伴关系谈判；要做地区和平的稳定双锚，共同致力于在亚太地区建立开放、透明、平等、包容的安全与合作架构，实现共同、综合、合作、可持续安全。, 第三，中印两国要做战略协作的全球伙伴，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。当前，和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流更加强劲。然而，国际关系中的不公平不合理现象仍然突出，全球性挑战层出不穷，各种地区冲突和局部战争此起彼伏。维护世界和平、促进共同发展任重道远。中印两国在全球事务中面临相似挑战、拥有广泛共同利益，也肩负着重大责任。, 中印两国，人口加起来有25亿多。中印一个声音说话，全世界都会倾听；中印携手合作，全世界都会关注。中印两国应该加强在全球事务中的战略协作，继承和发扬和平共处五项原则，坚持主权平等、公平正义、共同安全，坚持共同发展、合作共赢、包容互鉴，维护两国和广大发展中国家共同利益。, 中印两国要以自身发展为世界经济增长和全球治理作出更大贡献，为气候变化、粮食安全、能源安全、网络安全等全球性问题提供代表广大发展中国家利益的方案。中国愿同印度加强在中俄印、金砖国家、二十国集团、上海合作组织等多边机制内的战略协作。中国支持印度在联合国包括安理会发挥更大作用的愿望。, 邻居之间难免磕磕碰碰。中印两国要正视边界等历史遗留问题，通过和平友好协商，争取早日找到公平合理、双方都能接受的解决方案。同时，我们不能只把眼睛盯在分歧上而忽略了友谊和合作，更不能让两国发展进程和两国关系大局受到干扰。我相信，作为两大古老文明，中印两国有能力、有智慧走出一条相邻大国友好相处之道。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 许多印度朋友非常关注中国发展，希望中国发展得更好。改革开放30多年来，中国经济社会发展取得了显著成就，人民生活不断改善，世界各国都从中国发展中受益。我们也注意到，国际上有的人宣称，中国发展起来后会走“国强必霸”的老路，对其他国家构成“威胁”。我想明确告诉大家，中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路。, 中华民族历来爱好和平，和平、和睦、和谐的追求深深植根于中华民族的精神世界之中。中国自古就倡导“强不执弱，富不侮贫”，深刻总结了“国虽大，好战必亡”的箴言。以和为贵、和而不同、化干戈为玉帛、天下大同等理念在中国世代相传。古代中国曾经长期是世界强国，但中国对外传播的是和平理念，输出的是丝绸、茶叶、瓷器等丰富物产。中华民族主张的“天下大同”和印度人民追求的“世界一家”、中华民族推崇的“兼爱”和印度人民倡导的“不害”是相通的，我们都把“和”视作天下之大道，希望万国安宁、和谐共处。, 中华民族历来注重学习，强调“博观而约取，厚积而薄发”，强调“三人行，必有我师焉。择其善者而从之，其不善者而改之”，提倡“博学之，审问之，慎思之，明辨之，笃行之”。中华民族之所以历经数千年而生生不息，正是得益于这种见贤思齐、海纳百川的学习精神。我一直强调中国要做学习大国，不要骄傲自满，不要妄自尊大，而是要谦虚谨慎、勤奋学习，不断增益其所不能。, 中华民族历来注重敦亲睦邻，讲信修睦、协和万邦是中国一以贯之的外交理念。中国视周边为安身立命之所、发展繁荣之基。我们提出了亲、诚、惠、容的周边外交理念，就是要诚心诚意同邻居相处，一心一意共谋发展，携手把合作的蛋糕做大，共享发展成果。, 作为有着13亿多人口的国家，中国用几十年的时间走完了发达国家几百年走过的发展历程，这是历史性的成就。同时，我们也清醒认识到，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家，仍然处于社会主义初级阶段。中国经济总量虽大，但除以13亿多人口，人均国内生产总值还排在世界第八十位左右。让13亿多人都过上好日子，还需要进行长期艰苦努力。, 在相当长一个时期内，中国的中心任务是经济建设，并在经济发展的基础上推动社会全面进步。中国确定了自己的发展目标，这就是到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番、全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。我们形象地把这个目标概括为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。, 为了实现中国梦，中国需要长期和平稳定的外部环境。中国只有走和平发展道路，才能实现自己的发展目标。中国人民近代以后经历了100多年战乱频发的惨痛历史，决不希望这样的悲剧在任何地方重演。“己所不欲，勿施于人。”中国珍视和平、珍爱和平、维护和平的决心是不可动摇的。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 从尼泊尔到马尔代夫，从阿富汗到孟加拉国，南亚人民对美好生活的热望、对国家振兴的追求，展现了南亚发展的光明前景。我坚信，南亚是充满希望、潜力无穷的次大陆，可望成为亚洲乃至世界经济新的增长极。, 一个和平稳定、发展繁荣的南亚，符合本地区国家和人民利益，也符合中国利益。中国愿同南亚各国和睦相处，愿为南亚发展添砖加瓦。中国提出“一带一路”倡议，就是要以加强传统陆海丝绸之路沿线国家互联互通，实现经济共荣、贸易互补、民心相通。中国希望以“一带一路”为双翼，同南亚国家一道实现腾飞。, 中国和南亚各国是重要的合作伙伴。中国同南亚的合作，犹如等待发掘的巨大宝藏，令人憧憬。中国愿同南亚国家携手努力，争取在未来5年将双方贸易额提升至1500亿美元，将中国对南亚投资提升到300亿美元，将为南亚国家提供200亿美元优惠性质贷款。中国将扩大同南亚国家人文交流，未来5年向南亚提供1万个奖学金名额、5千个培训名额、5千个青年交流和培训名额、培训5千名汉语教师。中国将同南亚国家一道实施中国—南亚科技合作伙伴计划，充分发挥中国—南亚博览会作用，打造互利合作的新平台。, 中国是南亚最大邻国，印度是南亚最大国家。中国期待同印度一道，为本地区发展贡献更大力量，让喜马拉雅山脉两侧的30亿人民共享和平、友谊、稳定、繁荣。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 90年前，中国人民喜爱的印度伟大诗人泰戈尔访问了中国，受到中国人民热烈欢迎。一踏上中国的土地，泰戈尔就说：“我不知道什么缘故，到中国就像回到故乡一样。”在离开中国时，他伤感地说：“我的心留在这里了。”, 今天在座的有中印两国的青年代表。青年人是中印两国的未来，也是亚洲和世界的希望。青年人有现实主义者的喜怒哀乐，更有理想主义者的信念和执着。希望你们从中印古老文明中汲取智慧，在追求真理的道路上一路向前。希望你们加强心灵沟通，把年轻的心留在中国，把年轻的心留在印度，大家心心相印、共创未来。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 最后，我想告诉印度朋友的是，中国人讲求“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人”。中国在谋求自身发展的同时，真诚希望印度繁荣富强，期待同印度携手前行。在印度人民实现发展复兴的道路上，中国人民愿意始终同印度人民走在一起。我相信，深刻影响了人类文明发展的中印两国人民，一定会为亚洲和世界发展作出新的更大的贡献！, 丹尼瓦得（Dhanyavad）。谢谢。, （新华社新德里9月18日电） , 《 人民日报 》（

33,149,"[, Dear President and Mrs. Erbegdorj, Dear Chairman Enkhbald, Dear Prime Minister Altan Huyag,, Members, Ministers, Guests, Ladies, Gentlemen and friends: Hello everyone! Today, I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to Mongolia’s country, Khural, to meet with my friends. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all of you here, and through you to all the people of Mongolia! In 2008, when I was the vice president of the country, I chose Mongolia for my first visit. Stepping on this beautiful land, I deeply feel that this is a good place for Wuhua Tianbao. In his poem ""My Hometown"", the famous writer Nachuk Dolgi of your country once wrote: ""The towering mountains of Kent, Hang Ai, and Sayan Mountains are a series of mountains and hills that dot the North; Monan and Sha The endless Gobi of Erke and Nuomin is the vast desert sea that runs across southern Xinjiang. This is where I grew up, the beautiful Mongolian land!"", After 6 years, I came to Mongolia again and saw that it was a thriving place The scene is full of vigor and vitality, and I am heartily happy. I congratulate the hardworking and brave people of Mongolia on their development achievements! Yesterday, I held talks with President Erbegdorj, and just now I met with President Enkhbold and Prime Minister Altan Huyag. I exchanged in-depth views with Mongolian leaders on Sino-Mongolian relations and issues of common concern, and reached broad consensus. The two parties unanimously decided to upgrade China-Mongolia relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership and issued a joint declaration. They also signed more than 20 cooperation documents in various fields including politics, economy, trade, and humanities. I am satisfied with the results of this visit and have more confidence in China-Mongolia relations. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""Lu Yao knows horsepower and sees people's hearts for a long time."" 65 years ago, China and Mongolia officially established diplomatic relations. Mongolia is one of the first countries to recognize New China. We will not forget the support your country has given to New China. I would like to reiterate that no matter how the international and regional situation changes, China will always respect the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity of Mongolia and the development path chosen independently by the Mongolian people in accordance with the spirit of the treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation. This is a basic policy that we will stick to for a long time. , We are pleased to see that the Sino-Mongolian relations entering the second Jiazi are developing towards a higher level. Especially in the past 20 years, high-level exchanges between China and Mongolia have been frequent, and political mutual trust has been deepened. The pragmatic economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has developed rapidly. China has maintained the status of your country's largest trading partner and largest source of investment for many years. In 2013, there were more than 1.3 million person-to-person exchanges between China and Mongolia, of which Mongolian citizens went to China for more than 1 million person-times. It should be said that the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Mongolia coincides with the right time and is a matter of course, marking that China-Mongolia relations have entered the best development period in history. China and Mongolia are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, and are also important countries in the region. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia, the 20th anniversary of the revision of the China-Mongolia friendship and cooperation treaty, and the year of China-Mongolia friendly exchanges. Both sides should take the opportunity of establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership to push China-Mongolia relations to a higher level. First, China and Mongolia should be good neighbors who help each other. No matter how the international situation changes, both sides should firmly grasp the general direction of the relationship between the two countries, think of each other from the perspective of strategic partners, and be mutually firm on issues related to each other’s major core interests and major concerns, such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. stand by. The two countries should maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges. Leaders of the two countries can maintain regular meetings through various channels, strengthen strategic communication, and deepen political mutual trust. I invite President Elbegdorj to go to China in November this year to attend the Interconnecting Partners Dialogue held during the APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting. China welcomes President Enkhbald to pay an official visit to China this year. The two sides have decided to establish a regular exchange mechanism between the Chinese and Mongolian legislatures and a strategic dialogue mechanism between the Chinese and Mongolian diplomatic departments. The two sides will continue to strengthen their national defense cooperation within the framework of defense and security consultations. , China supports Mongolia’s participation in APEC, Mongolia’s active participation in East Asian cooperation, Mongolia’s participation in the East Asia Summit and China-Japan-South Korea cooperation in an appropriate manner, and support for the Northeast Asia Security Ulaanbaatar Dialogue Initiative proposed by Mongolia. , Asia-Europe Meeting, AsiaInfo Meeting, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other frameworks to strengthen cooperation with Mongolia. The Chinese side is willing to strengthen cooperation with the Mongolian side under the Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative and take a positive and open attitude to the grassland road initiative proposed by the Mongolian side. Both sides can strengthen cooperation on the new platform such as Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and develop together to benefit togetherThe Prairie Road Initiative is active and open. The two sides can strengthen cooperation on the new platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and develop together to benefit together. Second, China and Mongolia will be good partners for mutual benefit and win-win results. ""Near the water tower comes first."" China and Mongolia are geographically adjacent and economically complementary. China's market, capital, technology, channels and Mongolia's resource enrichment advantages are highly complementary and there are many opportunities for cooperation. Last year, China’s total imports and exports reached US$4.16 trillion. In the next five years, China is expected to import more than US$10 trillion in commodities, and the scale of foreign investment is expected to exceed US$500 billion. Last year, Chinese citizens traveled nearly 100 million people out of the country. It is estimated that by 2020 this number will exceed 150 million people per year. China's continued development will bring huge markets and opportunities to partners including Mongolia. During my visit, Mongolia's long-term concerns about transit transportation and estuary issues have been properly resolved. The two sides have established the Mining Energy and Connectivity Cooperation Committee and signed the ""Sino-Mongolian Economic and Trade Cooperation Medium-Term Development Outline"", which has set a goal of reaching US$10 billion in bilateral trade by 2020. The two sides conducted in-depth discussions on strengthening cooperation at ports and railways and reached consensus. The two sides decided to expand the scale of bilateral local currency swaps to 15 billion yuan, and the two sides agreed to study the establishment of a cross-border economic cooperation zone in China's Erlianhaote-Mongolia Zamud Ude and other places. The two sides will also carry out all-round cooperation in the fields of deep processing of mineral products, new energy, electricity, agriculture and animal husbandry, environmental protection and other fields. These new cooperation will certainly enhance the well-being of the two peoples and bring tangible benefits to the two peoples. Thirdly, China and Mongolia should be good friends who come and go often. It’s easy to walk when you’re familiar, and easy to talk when you’re familiar. Yesterday, when I held talks with President Erbegdorj, the two sides agreed to further active personnel exchanges, give each other more convenient visa policies, continue to strengthen institutional exchanges in the fields of youth, media and other fields, create a more favorable social atmosphere, and vigorously Promote China-Mongolia friendship. The Chinese side welcomes more Mongolian citizens to study, travel, do business and seek medical treatment in China. In the next five years, China will provide Mongolia with 1,000 training places, and increase the number of 1,000 Chinese government full scholarships to train 500 foreign students for the Mongolian army, invite 500 Mongolian youths to visit China, and invite 250 Mongolian journalists to visit. Hua, and to provide Mongolian free translation of 25 excellent Chinese film and television dramas. I believe this will play an important role in promoting mutual understanding and friendly feelings between the two peoples. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, the Chinese people are working hard to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"", and strive to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020, and build a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At the same time, the people of Mongolia are also committed to national reform and economic and social development. It can be said that the people of Mongolia also have a Mongolian dream in their hearts. China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive will radiate and drive neighboring countries, including Mongolia, and the development strategies of China and Mongolia can be effectively connected to promote common development and achieve common prosperity. At the same time, we are also very clear that achieving the goal of ""two hundred years"" is not an easy task for a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion and unbalanced development. Continue to work hard for a long time. To achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"", there must be a good surrounding environment. The door of the house is peaceful, so that we can feel at ease and do our business well. With the continuous development of China, some people in the world have doubts about China's direction and worry that China's strong development will pose a threat. This is either a misunderstanding or a misunderstanding. China has publicly stated on many occasions that China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, and at the same time will promote the common adherence of all countries to peaceful development. China will actively assume more international responsibilities, work with all countries in the world to safeguard human conscience and international justice, and to uphold justice and justice in world and regional affairs. China will continue to resolve disputes and disputes peacefully through dialogue and consultation with the utmost sincerity and patience. China has also publicly stated on many occasions that China respects the rights of peoples of all countries to choose their own development path, and will never impose its will on others, nor allow anyone to impose their will on the Chinese people. We advocate peaceful settlement of international disputes, oppose all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and never seek hegemony or expansion. The Chinese nation has always been a peace-loving nation, and Chinese culture advocates harmony. In the development of more than 5000 years of civilization, the Chinese nation has always pursued and inherited the firm concept of peace, harmony and harmony. The concept and tradition that value harmony and be good to othersThe nation has always pursued and inherited the firm concept of peace, harmony and harmony. Concepts and traditions that value peace, be kind to others, do not do what one wants, and do not impose on others have been handed down from generation to generation in China. They are deeply rooted in the spirit of the Chinese and are deeply reflected in the behavior of the Chinese. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has actively carried out foreign exchanges and commerce, rather than external aggression and expansion; it is dedicated to the patriotism of defending the home and protecting the country, not the colonialism of expanding the territory. Modern Chinese history is a history of tragic humiliation full of disasters, and a history of the great struggle of the Chinese nation to resist foreign aggression and achieve national independence. The suffering Chinese people cherish peace and will never impose the tragic experience they have suffered on other peoples. The Chinese people are willing to live in harmony with people from all over the world, develop harmoniously, seek peace, protect peace and share peace. China’s 30-year history of reform and opening-up has proved that peaceful development is a strategic choice made by China based on its own national conditions, social system, and cultural traditions. It conforms to the trend of the times, is in line with China’s fundamental interests, is in line with the interests of neighboring countries, and is in line with the interests of other countries in the world. Reason to change it. China has always regarded neighboring neighboring countries, including Mongolia, as partners for common development and sincere friends for maintaining peace and stability, and has established different forms of partnership with the vast majority of neighboring countries. We will continue to adhere to the principle of being good neighbors and partnering with neighbors, adhering to the policies of good neighborliness, safety and prosperity, and adhering to the concept of pro, honesty, benefit and tolerance when dealing with neighboring countries. , ""People gather firewood with high flames."" China is willing to provide opportunities and space for the common development of neighboring countries including Mongolia. Welcome everyone to take the train developed by China, either express or free, we all welcome, As the saying goes, ""walk fast alone, far away from others"". I have said many times that China’s cooperation with developing countries will adhere to the correct view of righteousness and benefit. If you don’t engage me to win, you lose, I will lose more, and you will take care of each other’s interests in specific projects. Chinese people believe in words and do what they say. What China has said and promised will certainly be achieved and will be fulfilled. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Mongolia has the proverb that ""neighborhoods are connected with each other, destiny is common"". The Chinese say ""good neighbors do not change gold."" China is the country with the most neighbors in the world, and we regard this as a precious asset. In today’s world, Asia is the most dynamic region for economic development, and it is also a region with many hot spots and sensitive issues. How can Asian countries properly handle relations with neighboring countries, achieve harmonious coexistence and common development with neighboring countries, and properly resolve their disputes and contradictions, Is a major issue. In my opinion, the key to cracking this issue is to follow the trend of the times and the people's wishes, adhere to the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, facing the future, and achieving win-win cooperation, and more use Eastern wisdom to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and promote harmony. 60 years ago, China, India, and Myanmar jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which became the basic guidelines for guiding the relations between countries. It was an important contribution made by Asian countries to promote the development of international relations. In advancing the process of regional cooperation, Asian countries exchange and learn from each other, and adhere to the Asian approach of mutual respect, consensus, and taking care of the comfort of all parties. This is a tradition of handling mutual relations that is consistent with the characteristics of the region. This tradition embodies the way that neighboring countries in Asia get along with each other. It should continue to carry forward today and stimulate endless endogenous power for peace, development and cooperation among Asian countries and the entire region. Upholding and practicing this tradition requires the following points. ,-Mutual respect and mutual trust. Historically, many Asian countries have suffered from external bullying, and deeply feel the value of national independence. Respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, respect for each country’s independent choice of social system and development path, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, and care for each other’s major concerns are important foundations for friendly relations among Asian countries. Asia has outstanding diversity and a tradition of openness and tolerance. Countries should promote exchanges and dialogue among civilizations on the basis of equality, deepen mutual understanding and mutual recognition, and build a solid foundation for stability and prosperity in Asia. , ——Assimilation and Dissimilation In the history of exchanges between Asian countries, friendly cooperation is the mainstream, but there are also some remaining issues. It is inevitable that bumps and bumps will occur between neighboring countries. The key is how to treat and handle them. Only through dialogue and cooperation to build consensus and resolve differences is the most effective guarantee for the long-term stability of the region. We should focus on the overall situation, friendly consultations, and jointly participate in international and regional governance, and play an active role in promoting the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and reasonable direction. , --win-win. Developing the economy and improving people's livelihood are the primary tasks faced by Asian countries, and strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation is an important glue for promoting peaceful coexistence in Asia. Asian countries should uphold the Asian consciousness of joint self-strengthening and mutual help, mutual help, mutual complementarity, expansion of interests, joint efforts to promote free trade zones and interconnection, and deepen regional economic integration.Asian consciousness, mutual assistance and mutual assistance, complementary advantages, expanding the integration of interests, working together to promote the construction of free trade zones and interconnections, deepening regional economic integration, achieving common development, making the cake of common interests, and improving the well-being of people in Asian countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! During my visit to Mongolia this time, I deeply felt that the friendship between China and Mongolia has been rooted in the hearts of the two peoples. This is the biggest source of confidence and motivation for the development of China-Mongolia relations. I believe that with the support of the two peoples, China-Mongolia relations will surely have a better tomorrow. , This year is the Year of the Horse in China and Mongolia. Horse is a symbol of strength and progress, and is loved by the people of China and Mongolia. I sincerely wish the Mongolian nation to build the spirit of the dragon horse and the galloping horses, and sincerely wish the China-Mongolia comprehensive strategic partnership quick success and success. Let us work together so that the seeds of friendship between China and Mongolia will be widely sowed in the hearts of the peoples of the two countries. , Valerilla!

尊敬的额勒贝格道尔吉总统及夫人，, 尊敬的恩赫包勒德主席，, 尊敬的阿勒坦呼亚格总理，, 各位议员，各位部长，各位嘉宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！今天，有机会来到蒙古国国家大呼拉尔，同各位朋友们见面，我感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位，并通过你们向全体蒙古国人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 2008年，我担任国家副主席时首次出访就选择了蒙古国。踏上这块美丽的土地，我深深感到这里是物华天宝的好地方。贵国著名文学家那楚克道尔吉在他的诗作《我的故乡》中曾写到：“肯特、杭爱、萨彦岭的巍峨群山，是点缀北国的层峦叠嶂；漠南、沙尔克、诺敏的无边戈壁，是横亘南疆的沙漠瀚海。这就是我生长的地方，美丽的蒙古大地！”, 时隔6年，我再次来到蒙古国，看到这里是一片欣欣向荣的景象，充满生机活力，感到由衷的高兴，我对勤劳勇敢的蒙古国人民取得的发展成就，表示衷心的祝贺！, 昨天，我同额勒贝格道尔吉总统举行了会谈，刚才又分别会见了恩赫包勒德主席、阿勒坦呼亚格总理。我同蒙古国领导人就中蒙关系和共同关心的问题深入交换意见，达成广泛共识。双方一致决定，将中蒙关系提升为全面战略伙伴关系并发表联合宣言，还签署了涉及政治、经贸、人文等各个领域的20多项合作文件。我对这次访问的成果感到满意，对中蒙关系更加充满信心。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “路遥知马力，日久见人心。”65年前，中蒙正式建立外交关系。蒙古国是最早承认新中国的国家之一。我们不会忘记贵国对新中国给予的支持。我愿再次重申：无论国际和地区形势如何变化，中国都将始终按照中蒙友好合作关系条约精神，尊重蒙古国独立、主权、领土完整，尊重蒙古国人民自主选择的发展道路。这是我们将长期坚持的一项基本政策。, 我们高兴地看到，进入第二个甲子的中蒙关系正朝着更高水平不断发展。特别是过去20年间，中蒙高层交往频繁，政治互信不断加深。两国经贸务实合作快速发展，中国连续多年保持贵国最大贸易伙伴国和最大投资来源国地位。2013年，中蒙人员往来130多万人次，其中蒙古国公民赴华超过100万人次。应该说，中蒙全面战略伙伴关系的建立恰逢其时、水到渠成，标志着中蒙关系进入历史最好的发展时期。, 中蒙是山水相连的友好邻邦，同为本地区重要国家。今年是中蒙建交65周年、中蒙友好合作关系条约修订20周年和中蒙友好交流年，双方应该以建立全面战略伙伴关系为契机，推动中蒙关系不断迈上更高台阶。, 第一，中蒙要做守望相助的好邻居。不论国际风云如何变幻，双方都要牢牢把握两国关系大方向，站在战略伙伴的角度多为对方着想，在涉及彼此主权、安全、领土完整等重大核心利益和重大关切问题上相互予以坚定支持。, 两国要保持高层交往势头，两国领导人可以通过各种渠道保持经常性会晤，加强战略沟通，深化政治互信。我邀请额勒贝格道尔吉总统今年11月赴华出席亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议期间举行的互联互通伙伴对话会，中方欢迎恩赫包勒德主席今年赴华进行正式访问。双方已经决定建立中蒙立法机关定期交流机制和中蒙外交部门战略对话机制，双方将在防务安全磋商框架内，继续加强两国国防合作。, 中方支持蒙方加入亚太经合组织，支持蒙方积极参与东亚合作，支持蒙方以适当方式参与东亚峰会和中日韩合作，支持蒙方提出的东北亚安全乌兰巴托对话倡议，愿在联合国、亚欧会议、亚信会议、上海合作组织等框架内同蒙方加强合作。, 中方愿同蒙方加强在丝绸之路经济带倡议下合作，对蒙方提出的草原之路倡议持积极和开放态度。双方可以在亚洲基础设施投资银行等新的平台上加强合作，共同发展，共同受益。, 第二，中蒙要做互利共赢的好伙伴。“近水楼台先得月。”中蒙地理相邻、经济互补，中方的市场、资金、技术、通道和蒙方的资源富集优势互补性很强，有许多合作机遇。去年，中国商品进出口总额达到4.16万亿美元。未来5年，中国预计将进口超过10万亿美元商品，对外投资规模预计超过5000亿美元。去年，中国公民出境旅游近1亿人次，估计到2020年这一数字将超过每年1.5亿人次。中国持续发展将为包括蒙古国在内的合作伙伴带来巨大市场和机遇。, 我这次访问期间，蒙方长期关心的过境运输、出海口等问题都得到了妥善解决。双方成立了矿能和互联互通合作委员会，签署了《中蒙经贸合作中期发展纲要》，确定了到2020年双边贸易额达到100亿美元的目标。双方就加强口岸、铁路合作等进行了深入探讨，达成了共识。双方决定将双边本币互换规模扩大至150亿元人民币，双方同意研究在中国二连浩特—蒙古国扎门乌德等地建立跨境经济合作区。双方还将在矿产品深加工、新能源、电力、农牧业、环保等领域开展全方位合作。这些新的合作必将增进两国人民福祉，给两国人民带来实实在在的利益。, 第三，中蒙要做常来常往的好朋友。路熟了走起来容易，人熟了聊起来容易。昨天，我同额勒贝格道尔吉总统会谈时，双方商定将进一步活跃人员往来，相互给予更加便利的签证政策，继续加强青年、媒体等领域机制性交流，营造更加有利的社会氛围，大力宣传中蒙友好。, 中方欢迎更多蒙方公民赴华留学、旅游、经商、就医。今后5年内，中方将向蒙方提供1000个培训名额，增加提供1000个中国政府全额奖学金名额，为蒙军培训500名留学生，邀请500名蒙方青年访华，邀请250名蒙方记者访华，并向蒙方免费提供25部中国优秀影视剧译作。相信这将对增进两国人民的相互了解和友好感情发挥重要促进作用。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，中国人民正在致力于实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标，努力到2020年全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。我们形象地把这个目标概括为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。同时，蒙古国人民也正致力于国家改革和经济社会发展，可以说蒙古国人民心中也有一个蒙古梦。, 中国进行改革开放和现代化建设，将辐射和带动包括蒙古国在内的周边国家，中蒙双方发展战略完全可以进行有效对接，促进共同发展，实现共同繁荣。, 同时，我们也十分清楚，实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标，对中国这样一个拥有13亿多人口、发展还不平衡的国家来说并非易事，可以说任重而道远，需要继续长期艰苦奋斗。实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标，必须有一个良好周边环境。家门口太平，我们才能安心、踏实办好自己的事情。, 随着中国不断发展起来，世界上有一些人对中国走向产生疑虑，担心中国发展强大后构成威胁。这要么是一种误解，要么就是一种曲解。, 中国多次公开声明，中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，同时也将推动各国共同坚持和平发展。中国将积极承担更多国际责任，同世界各国一道维护人类良知和国际公理，在世界和地区事务中主持公道、伸张正义。中国将继续以最大诚意和耐心，坚持通过对话协商以和平方式解决分歧和争端。, 中国也多次公开声明，中国尊重各国人民自主选择发展道路的权利，绝不把自己的意志强加于人，也绝不允许任何人把他们的意志强加于中国人民。我们主张以和平方式解决国际争端，反对各种形式的霸权主义和强权政治，永远不称霸，永远不搞扩张。, 中华民族历来是爱好和平的民族，中华文化崇尚和谐。在5000多年的文明发展中，中华民族一直追求和传承着和平、和睦、和谐的坚定理念。以和为贵，与人为善，己所不欲、勿施于人等观念和传统在中国代代相传，深深植根于中国人的精神中，深深体现在中国人的行为上。自古以来，中华民族就积极开展对外交往通商，而不是对外侵略扩张；执着于保家卫国的爱国主义，而不是开疆拓土的殖民主义。中国近代史，是一部充满灾难的悲惨屈辱史，是一部中华民族抵抗外来侵略、实现民族独立的伟大斗争史。历经苦难的中国人民珍惜和平，绝不会将自己曾经遭受过的悲惨经历强加给其他民族。中国人民愿意同世界各国人民和睦相处、和谐发展，共谋和平、共护和平、共享和平。, 中国改革开放30多年的历史已经证明，和平发展是中国基于自身国情、社会制度、文化传统作出的战略抉择，顺应时代潮流，符合中国根本利益，符合周边国家利益，符合世界各国利益，我们没有理由去改变它。, 中国始终把包括蒙古国在内的周边邻国视作促进共同发展的合作伙伴、维护和平稳定的真诚朋友，同绝大多数邻国建立了不同形式的伙伴关系。我们将继续坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴的方针，坚持睦邻、安邻、富邻的政策，在同邻国相处时秉持亲、诚、惠、容的理念。, “众人拾柴火焰高。”中国愿意为包括蒙古国在内的周边国家提供共同发展的机遇和空间，欢迎大家搭乘中国发展的列车，搭快车也好，搭便车也好，我们都欢迎，正所谓“独行快，众行远”。我多次讲，中国开展对发展中国家的合作，将坚持正确义利观，不搞我赢你输、我多你少，在一些具体项目上将照顾对方利益。中国人讲求言必信、行必果。中国说到的话、承诺的事，一定会做到、一定会兑现。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 蒙古国有“邻里心灵相通，命运与共”的谚语。中国人讲“好邻居金不换。”中国是世界上邻国最多的国家，我们把这当作宝贵财富。, 当今世界，亚洲是经济发展最具活力的地区，同时也是热点敏感问题较多的地区，亚洲国家如何正确处理同邻国关系，实现邻国和睦相处、共同发展，妥善解决彼此争议和矛盾，是一个重大课题。我认为，要破解这一课题，关键在于要顺应时代潮流和民心所向，坚持相互尊重、求同存异、面向未来、合作共赢的原则，更多用东方智慧来解决问题、化解矛盾、促进和谐。, 60年前，中国、印度、缅甸共同倡导和平共处五项原则，成为指导国与国关系的基本准则，是亚洲国家为促进国际关系发展作出的重要贡献。在推进区域合作进程中，亚洲国家交流互鉴，坚持相互尊重、协商一致、照顾各方舒适度的亚洲方式，这是符合本地区特点的处理相互关系的传统。这个传统体现着亚洲的邻国相处之道，在今天应该继续发扬光大，为亚洲国家以及整个地区和平、发展、合作激发出源源不断的内生动力。坚持和实践这一传统，要做到以下几点。, ——互尊互信。历史上，许多亚洲国家饱受外来欺凌之苦，深感国家独立自主之可贵。尊重独立、主权、领土完整，尊重各国自主选择社会制度和发展道路，互不干涉内政，照顾彼此重大关切，这是亚洲各国友好相处的重要基础。亚洲多样性突出，具有开放包容的传统，各国应该在平等基础上，促进不同文明交流对话，加深相互理解和彼此认同，为亚洲稳定和繁荣构筑坚实依托。, ——聚同化异。在亚洲各国交往史上，友好合作是主流，但也不乏一些遗留问题。邻国之间磕磕碰碰在所难免，关键是如何对待和处理。只有以对话和合作凝聚共识、化解分歧，才是地区长治久安最有效的保障。我们应该着眼大局、友好协商，共同参与国际和地区治理，为促进国际政治经济秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展发挥积极作用。, ——合作共赢。发展经济、改善民生是亚洲各国面临的首要任务，加强互利合作是促进亚洲和睦相处的重要粘合剂。亚洲各国应该秉持联合自强、守望相助的亚洲意识，互帮互助，优势互补，扩大利益交融，合力推进自由贸易区和互联互通建设，深化区域经济一体化，实现共同发展，做大共同利益的蛋糕，增进亚洲各国人民福祉。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 我这次访问蒙古国，深深感到中蒙友好已经植根于两国人民心中，这是中蒙关系发展最大的信心和动力源泉。我相信，在两国人民支持下，中蒙关系的明天一定会更加美好。, 今年是中国和蒙古国的马年。马是力量和进取的象征，深受中蒙两国人民喜爱。我衷心祝愿蒙古国国家建设龙马精神、万马奔腾，衷心祝愿中蒙全面战略伙伴关系快马加鞭、马到功成。让我们携手努力，让中蒙世代友好的种子广泛播撒在两国人民心中。, 巴耶里拉！谢谢！,

34,150,"[, On July 16, local time, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on ""Promoting Traditional Friendship, Sharing a New Chapter of Cooperation"" in the Brazilian Congress. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Jiansheng, Dear Mr. Karelos, Dear Vice President, Mr. Temer, Dear Mr. Alves, Mr. Speaker, Dear friends, distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, Friends: Bua Daji! good afternoon! Today, I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to the Brazilian Congress and meet friends. The Chinese believe that if they are destined, they can meet even if they are far away. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends present, to the warm and friendly Brazilian people, to the people of Latin America and the Caribbean countries! , Just now, I met with Speaker Karelos and Speaker Alves, and had a good conversation on China-Pakistan relations and issues of common concern. Tomorrow, I will hold talks with President Rousseff to discuss plans for the development of relations between the two countries. , 5 years ago, I came to Brasilia. This time I come back to this modern city with a new concept and profound meaning. The national spirit of the Brazilian people is pioneering, pioneering, self-confident, self-reliant, innovative, and courageous."" It is this national spirit that inspired the Brazilian people to work together and work hard, and the country’s construction and economic and social development have achieved impressive results. Eye-catching achievements. , Brazil’s national anthem sings: ""You are a giant made in heaven, you are beautiful, strong, and courageous, and your future is infinitely magnificent."" The Chinese people wish Brazil a more beautiful, stronger, and more magnificent future. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""A confidant in the sea and a neighbor in the world."" It would be more appropriate to use this ancient Chinese poem to describe the relationship between China and Pakistan. China and Brazil are separated by vast oceans, but the vast Pacific Ocean has failed to stop the process of friendly exchanges between the two peoples. Two hundred years ago, the first batch of Chinese tea farmers came across Brazil to teach tea. At the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, tea produced in Brazil won wide acclaim. The sincere friendship that the Chinese and Pakistani people have forged in the long years is just like the hard work of Chinese tea farmers. They plant hope, harvest joy, and taste friendship. Zhang Daqian, a Chinese master of traditional Chinese painting, had lived in Brazil for 17 years and painted ""Heung Wan Wan Tu"", ""Huang Shan Tu"", ""Homesickness Tutorial"" and other handed down treasures in the Bade Garden where he lived. , On August 15, 1974, China and Brazil formally established diplomatic relations, opening a new era in the development of bilateral relations. Confucius said: ""Forty without doubt"". We are happy to see that China-Pakistan relations have entered a more stable and matured year. Brazil is the first developing country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first Latin American country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. China and Pakistan regard each other as an important cooperative partner, and bilateral relations continue to develop, which can be called a model of South-South cooperation. , China has been Brazil’s largest trading partner for five consecutive years. Brazil has long been China’s largest trading partner and important investment destination in Latin America. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries not only covers traditional economic and trade fields, but also extends to resource satellites, regional aircraft, and deep-sea oil. High-tech fields such as exploration and development, biotechnology, etc. can be regarded as all-embracing. Our two countries have maintained close communication and collaboration on major international issues such as global governance, sustainable development, climate change, and information security within the framework of numerous international and multilateral mechanisms, effectively safeguarding the common interests of developing countries and promoting world peace and development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! China and Brazil are both major developing countries with significant influence and emerging market countries with broad development prospects. China-Pakistan relations have already surpassed the bilateral scope and have increasingly global influence. Our two sides should take the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries as a new starting point. Strategic partnership. First, we must grasp the direction of strategic cooperation. For 40 years, no matter how the international situation has changed, China and Pakistan have always insisted on mutual respect and treating each other as equals. This is the secret of the continuous improvement of relations between the two countries. With a view to safeguarding the fundamental interests of China and Pakistan, the two sides should continue to deepen strategic mutual trust and continue to understand and support each other on issues concerning national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. I said that shoes fit well, only those who wear them know. I heard that Brazil also has this proverb. Explain that this is a well-known routineMutual support. I said that shoes fit well, only those who wear them know. I heard that Brazil also has this proverb. Explain that this is common knowledge that everyone knows. There is no panacea for all diseases in the world, nor is there a universal development model. We should continue to firmly support each other on the development path that suits our national conditions. The exchanges between leaders of China and Pakistan have an irreplaceable role in leading the development of bilateral relations. The two sides should maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges, close exchanges between the government, legislatures, political parties, and localities, strengthen strategic dialogue and communication, and actively carry out exchanges of experience in governance and governance. The legislature plays an important role in the social and political life of the country, and direct communication between members of the legislature is an important part of bilateral relations. Not long ago, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Alves told me during his visit to China that strengthening friendly cooperation with China is a high-level consensus among all circles in Brazil. Similarly, the enthusiasm of all sectors of Chinese society to strengthen cooperation with Brazil is increasing day by day. I hope that all parliamentarians can make use of their own advantages and continue to contribute to the friendship building between China and Pakistan and the People's Republic of China. , Second, we must do a good job of joint development. Both China and Pakistan are countries with a large territory and a large population. They are at a critical stage of development. They are facing arduous development tasks and a complex external economic environment. They are all seeking growth momentum for reform, adjustment, and innovation. The development potential of the two countries will be further released. . The two sides should seize the opportunity and take advantage of the trend to promote deeper, broader and better development of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. , Policy planning is a compass for development. The two sides should play the role of the high-level coordination and cooperation committee of the two countries, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, accelerate the implementation of the 10-year cooperation plan between China and Pakistan, and expand the development strategy of the two sides. Both sides should promote cooperation in scientific and technological innovation and the transformation of their achievements, strengthen cooperation in high-tech fields such as information technology and biotechnology, and increase the gold content of cooperation. In 2013, the bilateral trade volume between China and Brazil has exceeded 90 billion US dollars. The two sides should continue to expand the scale of trade, increase the proportion of high value-added products, and properly resolve trade frictions. Both sides should expand mutual investment, play the role of financial engine, and steadily advance a number of strategic cooperation projects that meet the development needs of both parties and better benefit the people of both countries. , Third, we have to shoulder international responsibilities. The world today is undergoing profound and complex changes. Peace, development, cooperation and win-win have become the trend of the times. The world’s multi-polarization and economic globalization have developed in depth. Cultural diversity and social informationization have continued to advance. The scientific and technological revolution has bred new breakthroughs and emerging markets. The overall strength of the country and the developing countries has increased, and the balance of international power has developed in the direction of safeguarding world peace. At the same time, the world is still very restless. The international financial crisis has far-reaching effects, unstable and uncertain world economic growth has increased, global development imbalances have increased, hegemonism, power politics and new interventionism have increased, local turbulence has occurred frequently, food security, energy resources security, network security, etc. Global problems are more prominent. Promoting world multipolarization and democratization of international relations, achieving sustainable development of the world economy, and maintaining the diversity of world civilization have become major global issues. , Fairness and justice are the lofty goals pursued by people of all countries in the field of international relations. In today's international relations, fairness and justice are far from being realized. Mr. Niemer, the designer of the Brazilian Parliament Building, once said: ""If one day the world becomes more just, life will be simpler."" There is only one earth for mankind, and all countries live together in one world. History shows us that weak meat and strong food are not a way for human beings to coexist. Poor soldiers cannot bring a better world. All countries in the world must abide by the principles of equality and mutual trust, tolerance and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation, together to maintain and promote international fairness and justice, and promote the construction of a harmonious world of lasting peace and common prosperity. As the major developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres, China and Pakistan, while realizing their own development, should actively fulfill their international responsibilities, safeguard and promote international fairness and justice, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. To maintain and promote international fairness and justice, we must adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We should promote respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, respect for the diversity of world civilizations and diversity of national development paths, respect and safeguard the rights of peoples of all countries to choose their own social system, and oppose all forms of hegemonism and power politics. We should advocate the consciousness of the community of human destiny, take into account the legitimate concerns of other countries in the pursuit of our own interests, promote the common development of all countries in the pursuit of national development, and establish a more equal and balanced new global development partnership. We should advocate the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, respect and guarantee the security of every country, strengthen international and regional cooperation, and jointly respond to the increasing number of non-traditional security threats. We should strengthen coordination and cooperation within international and multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the BRICS countries.Security threats. We should strengthen coordination and cooperation within international and multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G20, and the BRICS countries, gather the strength of developing countries, actively participate in global governance, and strive for more institutional power for developing countries And the right to speak. To maintain and promote international fairness and justice, we must uphold sovereign equality. Sovereignty is the fundamental symbol of national independence and the fundamental embodiment and reliable guarantee of national interests. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community and have equal rights to participate in international affairs. Countries should respect each other’s core interests and major concerns. The affairs of various countries should be managed by the people of all countries. The destiny of the world must be controlled by the people of all countries. The affairs of the world can only be handled by the governments and peoples of all countries in consultation. In today's world, the development of the Internet poses new challenges to national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and must be seriously addressed. Although the Internet is characterized by a high degree of globalization, every country’s sovereign rights and interests in the information field should not be violated, and the development of Internet technology cannot infringe upon the information sovereignty of other countries. In the information field, there is no double standard, and all countries have the right to maintain their own information security. One country cannot be safe while others are unsafe. Some countries are safe while others are unsafe. Nor can they sacrifice the security of other countries to seek their so-called absolute security. The international community should build on the principles of mutual respect and mutual trust, and through active and effective international cooperation, jointly build a peaceful, secure, open, and cooperative cyberspace, and establish a multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet governance system. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Latin America and the Caribbean are a colorful and hopeful land. Latin American Liberator Bolivar said: ""The unity of the Latin American people is not an ingenuity, but a fate that cannot be escaped."" For a long time, the hard-working and intelligent people of Latin America and the Caribbean have actively explored development paths that are in line with their own reality and are maintaining Great achievements have been made in national stability, revitalization of the national economy, improvement of people’s lives, promotion of regional integration and diplomatic diversification, and they are playing an increasingly important role on the international stage. The Chinese people are sincerely happy for this, and sincerely wish the people of Latin America and the Caribbean continuous new and greater achievements. The relationship between China and Latin America has a long history. As early as the second half of the 16th century, the ""Ship of China"" loaded with silk and porcelain set sail from China's Fujian and Guangdong ports and traveled to Latin America, creating a precedent for friendly exchanges between China and Latin America. Since the beginning of the 21st century, China-Latin America relations have developed comprehensively and rapidly, bringing tangible benefits to the people of both sides. Under the new situation, the comprehensive promotion of mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation between China and Latin America is the common expectation of the people of both sides. China is willing to work with Brazil and other Latin American and Caribbean countries to make the two sides a good friend and a good partner working together. Tomorrow afternoon, I will attend the China-Latin America and Caribbean leaders meeting. I look forward to exchanging views with the leaders of Latvia on governance experience, Sino-Latin American relations, and major international and regional issues of common concern, and making important decisions on the establishment of the China-Latin America Community Forum and the promotion of overall cooperation between the two sides, promoting the establishment of equality and mutual benefit, The China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership of common development promotes the great development of China-Latin America relations. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, the Chinese people are striving to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China is the largest developing country in the world, and development is the key to solving all problems in China. China has clarified its development goals for a period to come. By 2020, it will achieve GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents double that of 2010, and fully build a well-off society that will benefit more than a billion people. By the middle of this century, a prosperous democracy Civilized and harmonious socialist modern country. The Chinese nation has always been a peace-loving nation. China firmly opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and is willing to work with other countries to safeguard human conscience and international justice. China cannot develop without the world, and world development also requires China. We will always pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, commit ourselves to our own development, and also emphasize our responsibility and contribution to the world for the benefit of the Chinese people and the people of other countries. , Brazilian writer Paul Coelho said: ""The world is in the hands of those who have the courage to use their talents to realize their dreams."" Unity, collaboration and development are the dreams of the Latin American people. The Chinese dream and the Latin American dream are interlinked. Both China and Latin America must have the courage to pursue their dreams and realize their dreams together. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""The acquaintance of people is for knowing each other; the acquaintance for people is for knowing."" People's friendship is the source of strength for the development of bilateral relations between China and Pakistan. In the 1980s, the Brazilian TV series ""The Girl Slave"" became popular in China, and Izola's pursuit of freedom and love moved hundreds of millions of Chinese viewers.The source of strength of the exhibition. In the 1980s, the Brazilian TV series ""The Girl Slave"" became popular in China. Izola's pursuit of freedom and love moved the hearts of hundreds of millions of Chinese viewers. Brazilian music and dance are loved by more and more Chinese young people. At the same time, the popularity of Chinese language and Chinese culture in Brazil continues to heat up. Brazil is the Latin American country with the largest number of Confucius Institutes and Confucius Classrooms. There are already 7 Confucius Institutes and 2 Confucius Classrooms with many students. The two sides should continue to promote cultural exchanges, actively create conditions to promote youth exchanges, and allow China-Pakistan friendship to be passed on from generation to generation. , Brazilians say that friendship is like wine, the longer it is, the better. For a long time, the broad masses of people who are enthusiastic about the development of China-Latin America relations have made silent contributions to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people. , An elderly Brazilian in Brazil, Carlos Tavares, said he was ""a Brazilian with a Chinese heart"". For more than 40 years, he has tirelessly followed and studied China. He has been writing 8 books and more than 500 articles about China, and has made hundreds of speeches about China. Many Brazilians know China and approach China because of his writing. Someone asked him what motivated him to do so. He said, ""I just want to introduce China and let more people know about China. There is no other picture."" This touching story is just a beautiful wave in the long river of friendly exchanges between Chinese and Latin American people. Thanks to the hard work of many Chinese and Latin Americans, the relationship between China and Latin America is just like the Yangtze River and the Amazon River. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""The tide is wide on both sides of the strait, and the wind is sailing."" Looking ahead, let us join hands and shoulder to shoulder to jointly create a better future for China-Pakistan comprehensive strategic partnership and jointly write a magnificent poem for China-Latin America comprehensive partnership. Make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development! , Obrigado! Thank you! , (Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, July 16), ""People's Daily"" (July 18, 2014 03 edition),]","Xi Jinping's speech at the Brazilian Congress: Promoting traditional friendship, writing a new chapter of cooperation",5095,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-07-18,"[, 当地时间7月16日，国家主席习近平在巴西国会发表《弘扬传统友好 共谱合作新篇》的演讲。　　新华社记者 刘建生摄, 尊敬的卡列罗斯参议长先生，, 尊敬的特梅尔副总统先生，, 尊敬的阿尔维斯众议长先生，, 各位议员朋友，各位嘉宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 布阿·达吉！下午好！今天，有机会来到巴西国会，同各位朋友相聚，感到十分高兴。中国人认为，如果有缘分，再远也能相会，叫作“有缘千里来相会”。, 首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位朋友，向热情友好的巴西人民，向拉美和加勒比各国人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 刚才，我会见了卡列罗斯参议长和阿尔维斯众议长，就中巴关系和共同关心的问题进行了很好的交谈。明天，我将同罗塞夫总统举行会谈，共商两国关系发展大计。, 5年前，我来过巴西利亚，这次再来这座构思新颖、寓意深刻的现代化城市，我想起了她的缔造者、巴西前总统库比契克的名言：“巴西利亚凝聚了巴西人民开拓进取、敢为人先、自信自强、推陈出新、勇于担当的民族精神。”正是在这种民族精神激励下，巴西人民同心协力、奋发有为，国家建设和经济社会发展取得了令人瞩目的成就。, 巴西国歌唱道：“你是天造地设的巨人，你美丽、坚强、充满勇气，你的前程无限壮丽。”中国人民祝愿巴西更美丽、更坚强、前程更壮丽。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”用这句中国古诗来形容中巴关系再贴切不过了。中国和巴西远隔重洋，但浩瀚的太平洋没能阻止两国人民友好交往的进程。200年前，首批中国茶农就跨越千山万水来到巴西种茶授艺。在1873年维也纳世界博览会上，巴西出产的茶叶赢得了广泛赞誉。中巴人民在漫长岁月中结下的真挚情谊，恰似中国茶农的辛勤劳作一样，种下的是希望，收获的是喜悦，品味的是友情。中国国画大师张大千曾旅居巴西17年，在他居住的八德园画出了《长江万里图》、《黄山图》、《思乡图》等传世珍品。, 1974年8月15日，中国和巴西正式建立外交关系，开启了两国关系发展新纪元。孔子说：“四十而不惑”。我们高兴地看到，进入不惑之年的中巴关系更加稳固、更加成熟。巴西是第一个同中国建立战略伙伴关系的发展中国家，也是第一个同中国建立全面战略伙伴关系的拉美国家。中巴两国相互视为重要合作伙伴，双边关系不断发展，堪称南南合作的典范。, 中国连续5年成为巴西第一大贸易伙伴，巴西长期是中国在拉美的最大贸易伙伴和重要投资目的地，两国务实合作不仅涵盖传统经贸领域，更拓展到资源卫星、支线飞机、深海石油勘探开发、生物技术等高技术领域，称得上是上天入海、包罗万象。我们两国在众多国际和多边机制框架内就全球治理、可持续发展、气候变化、信息安全等重大国际事务保持密切沟通和协作，有力维护了发展中国家共同利益，促进了世界和平与发展。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国和巴西同为有重要影响的发展中大国和发展前景广阔的新兴市场国家，中巴关系早已超越双边范畴，越来越具有全球性影响。我们双方应该以两国建交40周年为新起点，承前启后，继往开来，以更加长远的眼光、更加宽广的胸怀、更加坚定的信心，在更高水平、更宽领域、更大舞台上推进中巴全面战略伙伴关系。, 第一，我们要把握战略协作方向。40年来，不管国际风云如何变幻，中巴始终坚持相互尊重、平等相待，这是两国关系不断拾级而上的秘诀所在。着眼维护中巴两国根本利益，双方要不断深化战略互信，在涉及国家主权、安全、领土完整等重大核心利益问题上继续相互理解，相互支持。我说过，鞋子合不合脚，只有穿的人才知道。我听说，巴西也有这样的谚语。说明这是一个众人皆知的常识。世界上没有包治百病的灵丹妙药，也没有放之四海而皆准的发展模式。我们应该继续坚定支持对方走符合自身国情的发展道路。, 中巴两国领导人交往对引领两国关系发展具有不可替代的作用。双方应该保持高层交往势头，密切政府、立法机关、政党、地方交往，加强战略对话和沟通，积极开展治国理政经验交流。, 立法机关在国家社会政治生活中起着重要作用，立法机关成员直接交往是双边关系的重要组成部分。前不久，阿尔维斯众议长访华期间向我谈到，加强同中国的友好合作是巴西朝野各界的高度共识。同样，中国社会各界加强同巴西合作的热情正日益高涨。希望各位议员发挥自身优势，为中巴两国和中拉人民友谊大厦不断添砖加瓦。, 第二，我们要做好共同发展文章。中巴都是国土广袤、人口众多的国家，都处在关键发展阶段，面临艰巨的发展任务和复杂的外部经济环境，都在向改革、调整、创新要增长动力，两国发展潜力将进一步释放。双方应该抓住机遇、乘势而上，推动两国务实合作更深、更广、更好发展。, 政策规划是发展的指南针。双方应该发挥两国高层协调与合作委员会的作用，加强宏观经济政策协调，加快落实中巴十年合作规划，扩大双方发展战略契合点。双方应该推动科技创新合作及其成果转化，加强信息技术、生物技术等高技术领域合作，提高合作含金量。, 2013年，中巴双边贸易额已经超过900亿美元，双方应该继续扩大贸易规模，增加高附加值产品比重，妥善解决贸易摩擦。双方应该扩大相互投资，发挥金融引擎作用，稳步推进一批符合双方发展需要、更好造福两国人民的战略性合作项目。, 第三，我们要肩负国际责任担当。当今世界正在发生深刻复杂变化，和平、发展、合作、共赢已经成为时代潮流，世界多极化、经济全球化深入发展，文化多样化、社会信息化持续推进，科技革命孕育新突破，新兴市场国家和发展中国家整体实力增强，国际力量对比朝着有利于维护世界和平方向发展。, 同时，世界仍然很不安宁。国际金融危机影响深远，世界经济增长不稳定不确定因素增多，全球发展不平衡加剧，霸权主义、强权政治和新干涉主义有所上升，局部动荡频繁发生，粮食安全、能源资源安全、网络安全等全球性问题更加突出。推动世界多极化、国际关系民主化，实现世界经济可持续发展，维护世界文明多样性，成为全球性主要议题。, 公平正义是世界各国人民在国际关系领域追求的崇高目标。在当今国际关系中，公平正义还远远没有实现。巴西国会大厦的设计者尼迈尔先生曾经说过：“如果有一天世界变得更加公正，生活将更加简单。”人类只有一个地球，各国共处一个世界。历史昭示我们，弱肉强食不是人类共存之道，穷兵黩武无法带来美好世界。世界各国都要遵循平等互信、包容互鉴、合作共赢的原则，一起来维护和弘扬国际公平正义，推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。, 作为东西半球的发展中大国，中巴两国在实现自身发展的同时，应该积极履行国际责任，维护和弘扬国际公平正义，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。, 维护和弘扬国际公平正义，必须坚持联合国宪章宗旨和原则。我们应该提倡尊重各国主权和领土完整，尊重世界文明多样性和国家发展道路多样化，尊重和维护各国人民自主选择社会制度的权利，反对各种形式的霸权主义和强权政治。我们应该倡导人类命运共同体意识，在追求本国利益时兼顾他国合理关切，在谋求本国发展中促进各国共同发展，建立更加平等均衡的新型全球发展伙伴关系。我们应该倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的理念，尊重和保障每一个国家的安全，加强国际和地区合作，共同应对日益增多的非传统安全威胁。我们应该加强在联合国、世界贸易组织、二十国集团、金砖国家等国际和多边机制内的协调和配合，凝聚发展中国家力量，积极参与全球治理，为发展中国家争取更多制度性权力和话语权。, 维护和弘扬国际公平正义，必须坚持主权平等。主权是国家独立的根本标志，也是国家利益的根本体现和可靠保证。国家不分大小、强弱、贫富，都是国际社会平等成员，都有平等参与国际事务的权利，各国应该尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切。各国的事务应该由各国人民自己来管，世界的命运必须由各国人民共同掌握，世界上的事情只能由各国政府和人民共同商量来办。, 当今世界，互联网发展对国家主权、安全、发展利益提出了新的挑战，必须认真应对。虽然互联网具有高度全球化的特征，但每一个国家在信息领域的主权权益都不应受到侵犯，互联网技术再发展也不能侵犯他国的信息主权。在信息领域没有双重标准，各国都有权维护自己的信息安全，不能一个国家安全而其他国家不安全，一部分国家安全而另一部分国家不安全，更不能牺牲别国安全谋求自身所谓绝对安全。国际社会要本着相互尊重和相互信任的原则，通过积极有效的国际合作，共同构建和平、安全、开放、合作的网络空间，建立多边、民主、透明的国际互联网治理体系。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 拉美和加勒比是一片多姿多彩、充满希望的热土。拉美解放者玻利瓦尔说：“拉美人民的团结并不是谁的别出心裁，而是不可逃脱的命运使然。”长期以来，勤劳智慧的拉美和加勒比人民，积极探索符合自身实际的发展道路，在维护国家稳定、振兴民族经济、改善人民生活、推进地区一体化和外交多元化等方面取得了重大成就，在国际舞台上发挥着越来越重要的作用。中国人民为此感到由衷高兴，衷心祝愿拉美和加勒比人民不断取得新的更大成就。, 中拉关系源远流长。早在16世纪下半叶，满载着丝绸和瓷器的“中国之船”就从中国的闽粤港口起航，辗转远赴拉美，开创了中拉友好交往的先河。, 进入21世纪以来，中拉关系全面快速发展，给双方人民带来了实实在在的好处。新形势下，全面推进中拉互利友好合作是双方人民共同期待。中方愿意同巴西及其他拉美和加勒比国家一道努力，使双方成为志同道合的好朋友、携手共进的好伙伴。, 明天下午，我将出席中国—拉美和加勒比国家领导人会晤。我期待着同拉方领导人就治国理政经验、中拉关系以及共同关心的重大国际和地区问题交流看法，就建立中国—拉共体论坛、推进双方整体合作作出重要决定，推动建立平等互利、共同发展的中拉全面合作伙伴关系，推动中拉关系实现大发展。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。中国是世界上最大的发展中国家，发展是解决中国所有问题的关键。中国已经明确了今后一个时期的发展目标，即到2020年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成惠及十几亿人口的小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。, 中华民族历来是爱好和平的民族，坚定不移走和平发展道路。中国坚决反对各种形式的霸权主义和强权政治，愿意同各国一起维护人类良知和国际公理。中国发展离不开世界，世界发展也需要中国。我们将始终不渝奉行互利共赢的开放战略，致力于自身发展，也强调对世界的责任和贡献，造福中国人民，也造福各国人民。, 巴西作家保罗·科埃略说过：“世界掌握在那些有勇气凭借自己的才能去实现自己梦想的人手中。”团结协作、发展振兴是拉美人民薪火相传的梦想。中国梦和拉美梦息息相通。中拉双方要勇于追梦、共同圆梦。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “人之相识，贵在相知；人之相知，贵在知心。”人民友好是中巴双边关系发展的力量源泉。上世纪80年代，巴西电视剧《女奴》风靡中国，伊佐拉对自由和爱情的追求打动了亿万中国观众的心。巴西音乐和舞蹈受到越来越多中国年轻人喜爱。同时，在巴西中文热、中华文化热不断升温。巴西是设立孔子学院和孔子课堂最多的拉美国家，已经开设的7所孔子学院、2个孔子课堂学生众多，后续生源踊跃。双方应该持续推动人文交流，积极创造条件，促进年轻人交往，让中巴友谊世代传承。, 巴西人说，友谊就像葡萄酒一样，时间越久越好。长期以来，热心中拉关系发展的广大人士，为增进中拉人民相互了解和友谊默默奉献。, 巴西一位耄耋老人卡洛斯·塔瓦雷斯说自己是“一个有颗中国心的巴西人”。40多年来，他孜孜不倦关注和研究中国，笔耕不辍撰写关于中国的8本书籍和500多篇文章，作了数百场关于中国的演讲。许多巴西人因为他的文字认识中国、走近中国。有人问他这样做的动机是什么，他说“我只想介绍中国，让更多人了解中国，别无他图”。, 这个感人故事，只是中拉人民友好交往长河中的一朵美丽浪花。正是得益于众多中拉人士的辛勤付出，中拉关系才如同长江和亚马孙河一样奔流不息、一往无前！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “潮平两岸阔，风正一帆悬。”展望未来，让我们手拉手、肩并肩，共同开创中巴全面战略伙伴关系更加美好的未来，共同谱写中拉全面合作伙伴关系的壮丽诗篇，共同为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 奥布里嘎多！谢谢！,

35,151,"[, Dear President Wu Rantian,, Teachers, Classmates, Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends:, 　　An Ning Hasimiga! Hello everyone! Today, I had the opportunity to come to Seoul National University, the highest institution in Korea, and I was very happy to meet with teachers, students and friends from all walks of life. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all of you here and to all Korean citizens! , 　　 My current visit to South Korea was a state visit at the invitation of President Park Geun-hye, and I also came to visit my neighbor's house to see friends. Yesterday, I held talks with President Park Geun-hye and exchanged in-depth views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern, including regional and international situations, and reached broad consensus. , 　　 China and South Korea live next to each other. Buy a house for a hundred dollars, buy a neighbor for a thousand dollars. Looking back on history, the friendly stories of China and South Korea are everywhere. From Xudu from Dongdu seeking immortals to Jeju Island, to Jin Qiaojue, a Silla prince Jin Qiaojue who sat on the body of Jiuhuashan in Jinjin; from Cui Zhiyuan, the ""Eastern Confucian sect"" who studied in the Tang Dynasty, to Dongdu Korea and founding Confucius descended from the peninsula of Confucius; from Mr. Jin Jiu, the 27th anniversary of the independence of Korea, to the composer of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Song, Zheng Lucheng, who was born in Korea... Economic tradition has a long history. The ancient Korean poet Xu Jun wrote a poem ""Everything from the liver and gallbladder, curling to reflect the cold moon"" can be used to describe the friendship between the people of China and South Korea. , 　　 In history, whenever faced with a crisis, the people of China and South Korea have been immersed in trouble and help each other. More than 400 years ago, the Renchen riots broke out on the Korean peninsula, and the military and civilians of the two countries fought against the enemy and fought side by side. General Deng Zilong of the Ming Dynasty and General Li Shunchen of the Joseon Dynasty both died in the battle of Luliang. The commander of the Ming Army Chen Lin still has descendants living in South Korea today. In the first half of the last century, Japanese militarism waged a brutal war of aggression against China and South Korea, annexed the Korean peninsula, and occupied half of China's mountains and rivers, and smashed the lives of China and South Korea. In the years when the War of Resistance Against Japan was in full swing, the people of our two countries depended on each other for life and death. The “Old Site of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea” in China, the Meixuan in memory of the Yi Fengji comrades in Shanghai, and the former site of the Xi’an Restoration Army witnessed the unforgettable history of the song. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea in 1992, the two countries have adhered to the principles of good times, favorable conditions and harmony, adhered to the principles of mutual respect, mutual trust, and assimilation, and grasped the general direction of win-win cooperation and the creation of the future, respecting each other’s core concerns and taking care of each other. Comfort, the relationship between the two countries has achieved leapfrog development. Now, China has become South Korea's largest trading partner, largest export market, largest source of imports, largest country for foreign investment, largest source of foreign students, and largest destination for overseas travel. South Korea has become one of China's most important trading and investment partners. The bilateral trade volume between China and South Korea exceeds the total trade volume of South Korea, the United States, South Korea, Japan, South Korea and Europe, with more than 800 flights between China and South Korea each week. Last year, there were 8.22 million person-to-person exchanges between China and South Korea. Within two years, it is expected to welcome 10 million person-to-person exchanges annually. China and South Korea are veritable strategic partners, and bilateral relations have entered the best development period. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Currently, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are working hard along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics to realize the Chinese dream of building a well-off society in an all-round way and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Korean people are also committed to creating a ""national happiness era"" 1. The Korean dream of creating the ""Second Hanjiang Miracle"". This convergence of development provides a historic opportunity for China and South Korea to strengthen cooperation. , 　　Everyone is interested in China's development prospects, because this is closely related to the future development of relations between China and South Korea. I want to talk about this first.　　 As we all know, after more than 30 years of rapid development through reform and opening up, China has made remarkable achievements in all areas of development. Its economic aggregate has ranked second in the world, and people’s lives have continued to improve. Faced with China's development, some people believe that the developed China will inevitably become a ""threat"", and even portray China as a terrible bull devil. What I want to tell you is that this view is incorrect. Fortunately, truth exists objectively, and it will not change with such statements. , 　　 China has set its future development goals, which is that by 2020, GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will double from 2010, a well-off society will be fully built, and by the middle of this century, a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious socialist modern country will be built. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is not easy to achieve this goal.Modern socialist country. We vividly summarized this goal as the Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is not easy to achieve this goal. For a long period of time, China is still the largest developing country in the world, and it will take hard work to improve the living standard and quality of more than 1.3 billion people. , 　　 As a country with more than 5,000 years of civilization history, facing the future, what kind of country will China be? This is a problem that many people care about, as well as teachers and students. There are many angles to answer this question. Here, I will talk about it from three aspects. , 　　 First, China will always be a country that maintains peace. The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation. It used to be, it is now, and it will also be in the future. The pursuit of peace, harmony and harmony is deeply rooted in the spiritual world of the Chinese nation. Since ancient times, the Chinese have put forward the proverbs ""Although the country is big, the belligerent war will perish"", and the concepts of ""valuing harmony"", ""world peace"", and ""world harmony"" have been passed down from generation to generation. After suffering, the Chinese people cherish peace and hope to seek peace, protect and share peace with all countries in the world. China will stick to the path of peaceful development. This is not an expedient measure, nor a diplomatic rhetoric, but a conclusion drawn from the objective judgment of history, reality, and the future. It is an organic unity of ideological self-confidence and practical consciousness. , 　　 Second, China will always be a country that promotes cooperation. The 21st century is a century of cooperation. China's development will never come at the expense of the interests of other countries. We will never do anything that harms others and self-interest. The Chinese people are willing to support and help each other in the process of realizing their beautiful dreams. China is willing to develop and prosper together with other countries. China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, adhere to the correct concept of justice and benefit, develop an open economic system, and strengthen and expand mutually beneficial cooperation with countries in Asia and the world in all directions. China adheres to the concept of pro-honesty, sincerity, benefit and tolerance, deepens mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries, and strives to better its own development to benefit neighboring countries. China insists on using developing countries as the basis of its foreign policy and will always be a reliable friend and sincere partner of developing countries. , 　　 Third, China will always be a country that learns with open mind. Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind. Although China has achieved tremendous development achievements, compared with the world's advanced level, we still have a big gap. The Chinese people are proud of what they have achieved, but they will not be complacent and stand still. Instead, they must have a broad mind and listen to the world with an open and tolerant attitude. China adheres to peaceful and different ideas, respects and protects the diversity of civilizations, and actively promotes the mutual respect and harmonious coexistence of different civilizations. China will continue to learn from the world, the people of all countries, and all the achievements of civilization created by mankind, so as to promote the development of China and the world.　　A China that maintains peace, promotes cooperation, and learns with humility will bring new opportunities for the development of China-ROK relations. Under the new situation, China and South Korea should adhere to good-neighborliness and friendship, strengthen political mutual trust, value mutual core interests and concerns, and ensure the long-term and healthy development of relations between the two countries; they should adhere to mutually beneficial cooperation, strengthen the integration of interests, strengthen macro-policy coordination, and continue to expand commonality The cake of interests; we should adhere to cooperation and security, jointly deal with complex security challenges, and share the development opportunities brought by peace and stability; we should insist on humanistic exchanges, build a bridge of friendship, and write a new chapter of friendship between the Chinese and South Korean people. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 ""Looking for a thousand miles to a higher level."" Today, China-ROK relations have reached a higher starting point. Our horizons should be broader and our goals should be more ambitious. Both China and South Korea are important countries in Asia. The people of China and South Korea were born and raised in Sri Lanka. Facing the new developments and changes in bilateral relations and the international and regional situation, China is willing to become partners with South Korea to achieve common development, partners for regional peace, partners to revitalize Asia, partners to promote world prosperity, and let Asia’s broad continent, The vast ocean has become a big platform for Sino-Korea cooperation. We must work together to integrate the beautiful dreams of the two countries into a more magnificent Asian dream with the wisdom of the East, and embark on a road of joint construction, sharing and win-win with the people of Asian countries. , 　　 To this end, we should focus our efforts on the following aspects. , 　　 First, build an open and integrated development pattern and jointly build a community of interests. We should make full use of our respective comparative advantages, push Asian countries to improve the level of opening up, accelerate the integration of markets, capital, and technology, so that the Asian economy can achieve integration and development in the process of opening up. We must unite Asian countries to meet the risks and challenges brought about by the adjustment of the international political and economic structure, share the opportunities and achievements of Asian economic development, and pay attention to the accumulation of weight and the improvement of quality to form a community of common interests. , 　　中To share the opportunities and achievements of Asian economic development, focusing not only on the accumulation of weight, but also on the improvement of quality, forming a community of common interests. , 　　 China is comprehensively deepening reform and opening up. This will not only inject endless momentum into China's development, but will also bring huge room for development and cooperation to Asian countries including South Korea. China’s proposal to establish an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will create favorable conditions for accelerating regional connectivity and infrastructure construction. China welcomes the relevant countries to actively participate in the preparation work. China and South Korea should strive to complete the free trade zone negotiations by the end of the year and jointly promote the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement to inject strong momentum into Asian economic and trade cooperation. , 　　 Asia is the Asian of the Asian people and the Asia of the world. Asian development needs the world, and world development also needs Asia. We welcome countries outside the region to actively participate in Asian development cooperation, welcome relevant international organizations to play an active role in Asian development, and are open to various regional and cross-regional economic and trade arrangements that are conducive to the better development of Asia. We take a positive attitude towards all wills and actions that contribute positive energy to peace and development in Asia. , 　　 Second, advocate the concept of cooperative development and practice the correct concept of justice and benefit in international relations. ""The country does not benefit from profit, but also from justice."" In international cooperation, we should pay attention to profit, and we must pay more attention to justice. The Chinese nation has always advocated that ""gentleman's righteousness is the quality"" and emphasized that ""injustice is rich and expensive, and it is like a cloud to me"". Last year, during President Park Geun-hye’s visit to China, when he spoke at the China-Korea Business Cooperation Forum, he said, ""Be friends first, then do business"" in Chinese, vividly reflecting the correct understanding of the relationship between justice and benefit, and profoundly interpreting justice as the first and first meaning The important ideology of Hou Li. , 　　 In international relations, we must properly handle the relationship between justice and profit. Politically, we must abide by the basic principles of international law and international relations, uphold fairness and justice, and treat each other as equals. Economically, we must base ourselves on the overall situation, take a long-term perspective, and insist on mutual benefit and common development. We must not only allow ourselves to live well, but also allow others to live well. , 　　 At present, economic globalization and regional integration are developing rapidly. Different countries and regions have formed a relationship between you and me. This determines that we must abandon the outdated zero-sum thinking when dealing with international relations. We cannot only pursue you and lose others, harm others and benefit others, let alone win and lose, and a family-wide take. Only balance of righteousness and benefit can win both righteousness and benefit, and only balance of righteousness and benefit can win both righteousness and benefit. , 　　 Third, properly resolve conflicts and differences and shape a peaceful and stable development environment. The development of China and South Korea and the revitalization of Asia are inseparable from the peaceful and stable surrounding and regional environment. At present, the Asian region still faces various traditional and non-traditional security threats. Questions cannot be avoided, but the answers can be varied; history cannot be changed, but the future can be shaped. , 　　 Build consensus through dialogue and consultation, deal with differences in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, promote common development with a win-win attitude, and solve practical problems with a vision of the future. It is effective for countries to live in harmony, resolve conflicts and differences, and achieve regional peace and stability. Way and reliable guarantee. We need to innovate security concepts, and in the direction of achieving common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security, through in-depth political security dialogue and cooperation, we will make regional countries become partners of mutual trust and equal cooperation, and jointly maintain peace and development in Asia. , 　　 ""Neighborhood is good, goodwill is good."" China hopes that both sides of the peninsula will improve relations and support the eventual realization of independent and peaceful reunification. We are opposed to the emergence of nuclear weapons on the peninsula, and we advocate the settlement of relevant issues on the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear issue, through dialogue and consultation. ""Freezing three feet is not a cold day."" All parties concerned should maintain full patience and determination, actively engage in dialogue and contact, release mutual goodwill, take care of the concerns of all parties, and actively promote the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the realization of lasting peace and security. . As long as the ROK and DPRK continue to advance the process of improving North-South relations, the long-cherished wish of the people of the peninsula for independence and peaceful reunification will eventually be realized. In this process, the Chinese people will always be the trusted friends of the people on the peninsula. , 　　 Fourth, to strengthen cultural exchanges and continuously enhance people's feelings. Intersect with benefit, and disperse with all benefits; intersect with potential, and fall with momentum; but intersect with heart, only to achieve its longevity. In the final analysis, the development of state relations depends on the people's understanding. , 　　 Chinese Tai Chi culture has a long history. The Korean national flag is the Tai Chi flag, and we can best understand the ancient philosophy of yin and yang. If political, economic, and security cooperation are the strength to promote the development of national relations, then people-to-people exchanges are the soft power of the people to strengthen their feelings and communicate their hearts. Only by bringing the two forces together can we better promote countries to treat each other with sincerity and compatibility. , 　　 culture can play a role in improving the mutual understanding and friendship of the people, and it can play a role in bringing about the rain and keeping things quiet. China and South Korea have a blind date and cultural links, and have a unique advantage in carrying out humanistic exchangesThe solution and friendship can play the role of spring weather and rain, and moist things silently. The Chinese and South Koreans are close to each other and have similar cultural links. It is a unique advantage to carry out humanistic exchanges. Our two countries have established a joint committee for Sino-Korean humanities exchanges, which provides a good platform for expanding humanities cooperation and enhancing people's feelings. The government departments of the two countries should vigorously promote and guide, and people from all walks of life and the general public of the two countries should actively contribute to this. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　The people of China and South Korea have a natural sense of closeness, and for thousands of years have formed a deep friendship that is thicker than water. I will tell you two touching stories here. After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China, people from all walks of life in South Korea generously helped and helped. The teachers and students of the No. 1 High School in Jeonnam, South Korea, collected donations from China’s Beichuan Middle School. The principal of the school wrote in a letter to the headmaster of Beichuan Middle School: “If joy is divided between two people, it will become twice the joy, and pain will be divided. Two people will each have half of the pain."", 　　 Also in 2008, Zhang Bao, a Chinese bone marrow donor volunteer, had a car accident after matching with a Korean patient, but he continued to donate to this Korean patient after he was hospitalized and recovered marrow. The Chinese volunteer said: ""Life is a blessing, and it's hard for others to come. It's nothing to help."" So far, Chinese volunteers have donated 156 cases of bone marrow transnationally, including 45 cases of bone marrow donation for Korean patients , Far more than other countries. There are so many vivid examples, all of which are true portrayal of the friendship between the people of China and South Korea. The people of our two countries should work together to share more joy, share more difficulties, and better write a new psalm of friendship that lasts forever. , 　　 youth is the future of China and South Korea, and the future of Asia. Youth prosperity is national prosperity, youth is strong and the country is strong An Chonggen, a prince, once wrote the book page ""The day is not vain, youth will never come"", hoping that young people will cherish their youth and create brilliant life. Young people are the most energetic and dreamy, and the easiest to communicate and understand with each other. Korean TV dramas such as ""You from the Stars"" have aroused great interest among young people in China. Only wonderful youth can leave wonderful memories of life. It is hoped that the youths of the two countries will learn from each other and enhance their friendship. The loyal heirs of the friendship between China and South Korea will strive to be active participants in the revitalization of Asia. , 　　Seoul University brings together a large number of young talents from South Korea, I believe you will all become talents. I brought 10,000 volumes of books and film and television materials on China, and gave them to your school for teaching and academic research. Here, I announce that China invites 100 college students from your school to go to China in 2015 to participate in the ""Chinese Bridge"" college students summer camp. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 ""There will be long winds and waves, there will be times when the wind and the sea will be hung upright."" This is a famous verse of the Chinese Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai. I believe that as long as we raise the sail of friendly cooperation and insist on the course of mutual benefit and win-win, the huge ship of friendly cooperation between China and South Korea will ride the wind and waves and continue to sail towards the bright shore of peace and prosperity! , 　　Sense Msahamida! Thank you! , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, July 4th), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (July 05, 2014, 02 edition),]",Create a future for China-Korea cooperation,5468,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2014-07-05,"[, 尊敬的吴然天校长，, 老师们，同学们，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　安宁哈西米嘎！大家好！今天，有机会来到韩国最高学府国立首尔大学，同老师们、同学们以及各界朋友见面，感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位，向全体韩国国民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 　　我这次来韩国，是应朴槿惠总统的邀请进行国事访问，也是到邻居家串串门，看看朋友。昨天，我同朴槿惠总统举行了会谈，就双边关系及地区和国际形势等共同关心的问题深入交换意见，达成广泛共识。, 　　中韩两国毗邻而居。百金买屋，千金买邻，好邻居金不换。回顾历史，中韩友好佳话俯拾即是。从东渡求仙来到济州岛的徐福，到金身坐化九华山的新罗王子金乔觉；从在唐朝求学为官的“东国儒宗”崔致远，到东渡高丽、开创孔子后裔半岛一脉的孔绍；从在中国各地辗转27年的韩国独立元勋金九先生，到出生于韩国的《中国人民解放军军歌》作曲者郑律成……两国人民友好交往、相扶相济的传统源远流长。韩国古代诗人许筠写下的“肝胆每相照，冰壶映寒月”的诗句，完全可以用来形容中韩两国人民友谊。, 　　历史上，每当面对危难时，中韩两国人民都相濡以沫、患难相助。400多年前，朝鲜半岛爆发壬辰倭乱，两国军民同仇敌忾、并肩作战。明朝邓子龙将军和朝鲜王朝李舜臣将军在露梁海战中双双殉职，明军统帅陈璘今天还有后人生活在韩国。, 　　上个世纪上半叶，日本军国主义对中韩发动野蛮的侵略战争，吞并朝鲜半岛，侵占中国半壁江山，使中韩两国生灵涂炭、山河破碎。在抗日战争如火如荼的岁月中，我们两国人民生死相依、倾力相援。中国境内的“大韩民国临时政府旧址”、上海纪念尹奉吉义士的梅轩、西安光复军驻地旧址等，都见证了那段可歌可泣的难忘历史。, 　　1992年中韩建交以来，两国秉天时、得地利、应人和，坚持互尊互信、聚同化异的大原则，把握合作共赢、共创未来的大方向，尊重彼此核心关切，照顾对方舒适度，两国关系实现跨越式发展。现在，中国已经成为韩国最大贸易伙伴、最大出口市场、最大进口来源国、最大海外投资对象国、最大留学生来源国、最大海外旅行目的地国。韩国成为中国最重要的贸易和投资合作伙伴之一。中韩双边贸易额超过了韩美、韩日、韩欧贸易额的总和，每周往返于中韩之间的航班达800多个。去年，中韩人员往来达822万人次，不出两年就有望迎来年度人员往来1000万人次。中韩两国是名副其实的战略合作伙伴，双边关系迈入最好发展时期。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　当前，中国人民正在中国共产党领导下，沿着中国特色社会主义道路，为实现全面建成小康社会、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而努力奋斗，韩国人民也在致力于开创“国民幸福时代”、创造“第二汉江奇迹”的韩国梦。这种发展的交汇为中韩两国加强合作提供了历史性机遇。, 　　大家都对中国发展前景感兴趣，因为这与中韩两国关系未来发展有密切联系。我想先谈谈这个问题。, 　　众所周知，经过改革开放30多年的快速发展，中国各领域发展都取得了显著成就，经济总量已经位居世界第二，人民生活不断改善。面对中国发展，有些人认为发展起来的中国必然成为一种“威胁”，甚至把中国描绘成一个可怕的牛魔王。我想告诉大家的是，这种看法是不正确的。好在真理是客观存在的，并不会随着这样那样的说法而改变。, 　　中国已经确定了未来发展目标，这就是到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番、全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。我们形象地把这个目标概括为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。实现这个目标并不容易。在相当长时期内，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家，提高13亿多人口的生活水平和质量还需要付出艰苦努力。, 　　作为一个有着5000多年文明历史的国家，面向未来，中国将做一个什么样的国家呢？这是很多人关心的问题，也是老师们、同学们关心的问题。回答这个问题有很多角度，这里，我从3个方面来谈点看法。, 　　第一，中国将始终做一个维护和平的国家。中华民族是爱好和平的民族，过去是，现在是，将来也是。和平、和睦、和谐的追求深深植根于中华民族的精神世界之中。中国人自古就提出了“国虽大，好战必亡”的箴言，“以和为贵”、“天下太平”、“天下大同”等理念世代相传。历经苦难，中国人民珍惜和平，希望同世界各国一道共谋和平、共护和平、共享和平。中国将坚持走和平发展道路，这不是权宜之计，更不是外交辞令，而是从历史、现实、未来的客观判断中得出的结论，是思想自信和实践自觉的有机统一。, 　　第二，中国将始终做一个促进合作的国家。21世纪是合作的世纪。中国发展绝不以牺牲别国利益为代价，我们绝不做损人利己、以邻为壑的事情。中国人民愿意同各国人民在实现各自美好梦想的过程中相互支持、相互帮助，中国愿意同各国共同发展、共同繁荣。中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚持正确义利观，发展开放型经济体系，全方位加强和拓展同亚洲和世界各国的互利合作。中国坚持按照亲、诚、惠、容的理念，深化同周边国家的互利合作，努力使自身发展更好惠及周边国家。中国坚持把发展中国家作为对外政策的基础，永远做发展中国家的可靠朋友和真诚伙伴。, 　　第三，中国将始终做一个虚心学习的国家。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。中国虽然取得了巨大发展成就，但同世界先进水平相比，我们还有很大差距。中国人民为自己取得的成绩感到自豪，但不会骄傲自满、止步不前，而是要有海纳百川的胸怀，以开放包容心态虚心倾听世界的声音。中国坚持和而不同的思想，尊重和保护文明多样性，积极推动不同文明相互尊重、和谐共处。中国将继续向世界学习、向各国人民学习，学习人类创造的一切文明成果，推动中国和世界发展得更好。, 　　一个维护和平的中国、促进合作的中国、虚心学习的中国，将为中韩关系发展带来新的机遇。新形势下，中韩两国应该坚持睦邻友好，增强政治互信，重视相互核心利益和关切，确保两国关系长期健康发展；应该坚持互利合作，强化利益融合，强化宏观政策协调，不断做大共同利益的蛋糕；应该坚持合作安全，共同应对复杂的安全挑战，共享和平稳定带来的发展机遇；应该坚持人文交流，搭建友谊桥梁，谱写中韩人民友好新篇章。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼。”今天，中韩关系登上了更高起点，我们的眼界应该更加广阔，我们的目标也应该更加宏远。中韩都是亚洲重要国家，中韩两国人民生于斯、长于斯。面对双边关系及国际和地区形势的新发展新变化，中国愿同韩国成为实现共同发展的伙伴、致力地区和平的伙伴、携手振兴亚洲的伙伴、促进世界繁荣的伙伴，让亚洲宽广的大陆、辽阔的海洋成为中韩合作的大平台。我们要携手努力，以东方智慧，把两国美好梦想融入更为宏伟的亚洲梦，同亚洲各国人民走出一条共建、共享、共赢之路。, 　　为此，我们应该重点在以下几方面作出努力。, 　　第一，构建开放融合发展格局，共同打造利益共同体。我们应该充分利用各自比较优势，推动亚洲各国提高开放水平，加快市场、资本、技术融合，使亚洲经济实现在开放中融合、在融合中发展。我们要团结亚洲各国并肩应对国际政治经济格局调整带来的风险和挑战，分享亚洲经济发展的机遇和成果，既注重量的积累，又注重质的提升，结成休戚与共的利益共同体。, 　　中国正在全面深化改革、扩大开放。这不仅将为中国发展注入源源不断的动力，而且将为包括韩国在内的亚洲国家带来巨大发展和合作空间。中国倡议设立亚洲基础设施投资银行，将为加快地区互联互通和基础设施建设创造有利条件，中国欢迎有关国家积极参与筹建工作。中韩两国应该争取在年底前完成自由贸易区谈判，联手推动区域全面经济伙伴关系协定，为亚洲经贸合作注入强劲动力。, 　　亚洲是亚洲人民的亚洲，也是世界的亚洲。亚洲发展需要世界，世界发展也需要亚洲。我们欢迎域外国家积极参与亚洲发展合作，欢迎相关国际组织为亚洲发展发挥积极作用，对各种有利于亚洲更好发展的区域性、跨区域性经贸安排持开放态度。对一切为亚洲和平与发展贡献正能量的意愿和行动，我们都持积极态度。, 　　第二，倡导合作发展理念，在国际关系中践行正确义利观。“国不以利为利，以义为利也。”在国际合作中，我们要注重利，更要注重义。中华民族历来主张“君子义以为质”，强调“不义而富且贵，于我如浮云”。去年，朴槿惠总统访华期间，在中韩商务合作论坛演讲时用汉语说“先做朋友，再做生意”，生动反映了对义利关系的正确认识，深刻诠释了以义为先、先义后利的重要思想观念。, 　　在国际关系中，要妥善处理义和利的关系。政治上，要遵守国际法和国际关系基本原则，秉持公道正义，坚持平等相待。经济上，要立足全局、放眼长远，坚持互利共赢、共同发展，既要让自己过得好，也要让别人过得好。, 　　当前，经济全球化、区域一体化快速发展，不同国家和地区结成了你中有我、我中有你、一荣俱荣、一损俱损的关系。这就决定了我们在处理国际关系时必须摒弃过时的零和思维，不能只追求你少我多、损人利己，更不能搞你输我赢、一家通吃。只有义利兼顾才能义利兼得，只有义利平衡才能义利共赢。, 　　第三，妥善解决矛盾分歧，塑造和平稳定发展环境。中韩发展，亚洲振兴，都离不开和平稳定的周边和地区环境。当前，亚洲地区仍然面临各种传统和非传统安全威胁。问题无法回避，但答案可以多样；历史无法更改，但未来可以塑造。, 　　以对话协商方式凝聚共识，以互谅互让的精神处理分歧，以合作共赢的态度促进共同发展，以面向未来的眼光解决现实问题，是国家和睦相处、化解矛盾分歧、实现地区和平稳定的有效途径和可靠保障。我们要创新安全理念，朝着实现共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的方向，通过深入开展政治安全对话和合作，使地区国家成为相互信任、平等合作的伙伴，共同维护亚洲和平与发展。, 　　“邻望邻好，亲望亲好。”中国希望半岛南北双方改善关系，支持半岛最终实现自主和平统一。我们反对半岛出现核武器，主张通过对话协商解决包括核问题在内的朝鲜半岛有关问题。“冰冻三尺，非一日之寒。”有关各方应该保持充分耐心和定力，积极开展对话接触，相互释放善意，照顾各方关切，积极推进半岛无核化和实现持久和平安全的进程。只要韩朝双方持续推进南北关系改善进程，半岛人民渴望自主和平统一的夙愿终将实现。在这一进程中，中国人民永远是半岛人民可信赖的朋友。, 　　第四，加强人文交流，不断增进人民感情。以利相交，利尽则散；以势相交，势去则倾；惟以心相交，方成其久远。国家关系发展，说到底要靠人民心通意合。, 　　中国太极文化由来已久，韩国国旗是太极旗，我们最能领会阴阳相生、刚柔并济的古老哲理。如果说政治、经济、安全合作是推动国家关系发展的刚力，那么人文交流则是民众加强感情、沟通心灵的柔力。只有使两种力量交汇融通，才能更好推动各国以诚相待、相即相容。, 　　文化在增进人民相互了解和友谊方面可以起到春风化雨、润物无声的作用。中韩人缘相亲、文缘相通，开展人文交往具有得天独厚的优势。我们两国已经成立了中韩人文交流共同委员会，为扩大人文合作、增进人民感情提供了良好平台。两国政府部门应该大力推动和引导，两国各界人士和广大民众要积极为此贡献力量。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中韩两国人民有着天然的亲近感，千百年来形成了血浓于水的深厚友谊。我这里给大家讲两个感人的故事。2008年中国汶川特大地震发生后，韩国各界人士慷慨解囊、伸出援手。韩国全南第一高中的师生们向中国北川中学募集捐助善款，该校校长在给北川中学校长的信中写道：“喜悦分给两个人会变成两倍的喜悦，痛苦分给两个人就各剩下一半的痛苦。”, 　　同样是2008年，中国骨髓捐献志愿者张宝与韩国患者配型成功后遭遇了车祸，但他住院治疗康复后，继续为这位韩国患者捐献了骨髓。这位中国志愿者说：“人生祸福难料，人家现在大难临头了，帮点忙真不算什么。”迄今为止，中国志愿者共进行跨国捐献骨髓156例，其中为韩国患者捐献骨髓45例，远远超过其他国家。这样的生动事例不胜枚举，都是中韩两国人民友谊的真实写照。我们两国人民要共同努力，更多分享喜悦，更多分担困难，更好书写友谊地久天长的新诗篇。, 　　青年是中韩两国的未来，也是亚洲的未来。青年兴则民族兴，青年强则国家强。安重根义士曾挥毫写下“白日莫虚度，青春不再来”的书幅，希望青年人珍惜青春、创造生命辉煌。青年人最富有朝气和梦想，也最容易相互沟通和理解。《来自星星的你》等韩国电视剧，在中国引起了青年人的浓厚兴趣。只有精彩的青春才能留下人生精彩的回忆。希望两国青年互学互鉴、增进友谊，共当中韩友谊的忠实继承者，争做亚洲振兴的积极参与者。, 　　首尔大学汇集了韩国大批青年才俊，相信你们都将成为栋梁之才。我带来了1万册介绍中国情况的图书和影视资料，赠送给贵校用于教学和学术研究。在此，我宣布，中方邀请贵校100名大学生2015年赴华参加“汉语桥”大学生夏令营活动。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　“长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。”这是中国唐代诗人李白的著名诗句。我相信，只要我们升起友好合作的风帆，坚持互利共赢的航向，中韩友好合作的巨轮必将乘风破浪，不断驶向和平与繁荣的光明彼岸！, 　　感姆撒哈米达！谢谢！, 　　（新华社首尔7月4日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2014年07月05日 02 版）, ]",共创中韩合作未来

36,152,"[, Dear President Wu Dengsheng, Dear Vice President Ansari, Dear Diplomats, Guests, Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends: Today, we are here to commemorate the five principles of peaceful coexistence 60th anniversary. This is a grand event shared by China, India, Myanmar and the international community. It is of great significance for promoting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, enhancing friendly cooperation between peoples of all countries, and promoting world peace and development. Here, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the guests and friends! Just now, President Wu Dengsheng and Vice President Ansari delivered important and enthusiastic speeches. I highly appraise their speeches. 60 years ago, in the decolonization movement that emerged after the end of the Second World War, the cause of independence and liberation of the Asian, African, and Latin American nations flourished, and the new nation aspired to establish equal international relations. Following this historical trend, China, India, and Myanmar jointly advocated the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. On June 28 and 29, 1954, China and India and China and Myanmar respectively issued joint statements confirming that these five principles will be applied in their mutual relations and the relations between their respective countries and other countries in Asia and the world. This is a major innovation in the history of international relations and has made historic contributions to promoting the establishment of a fair and reasonable new type of international relations. In the past, we express our deep remembrance to the older generation of leaders of the three countries who jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and we pay high tribute to the people of insight who have long adhered to the promotion of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence! Today, we jointly commemorate the 60th anniversary of the publication of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which is to discuss how to better promote these Five Principles under the new situation, promote the establishment of a new type of international relations, and jointly build a beautiful world of cooperation and win-win. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The five principles of peaceful coexistence were born in Asia because they inherited the ideological tradition of the Asian people who advocate peace. The Chinese nation has always advocated the concepts of ""harmony is precious"", ""harmony is different"", ""concordance of all nations"", ""both love and not attack"" and other concepts. People in Asian countries such as India and Myanmar have always advocated values ​​of benevolence, charity and equality. Tagore, the great Indian poet, wrote in the language of poetry: ""Do you think that war can be used to gain friendship? Spring will come away from before your eyes."" The Burmese people built a peace tower to pray for world peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence vividly reflect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and give these purposes and principles a visible, feasible, and compliant meaning. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence contain four words ""mutual"" and one word ""common"", which not only represent the new expectations of Asian countries for international relations, but also reflect the spirit of international rule of law in which the rights, obligations and responsibilities of all countries are unified. In the 1950s, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the wind of friendship between China and India blew across the vast land of the two countries. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited India that year, he could hear the cheers of ""Panchahira Kindaba"" (Long live the Five Principles) and ""Indy Qinni Baba"" (Indian-Chinese people are brothers). Under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China and Myanmar properly resolved the border issue. In 1960, the two countries signed a border treaty, which was the first border treaty signed between New China and neighboring neighbors. China and Myanmar have also signed the China-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression, which is the first peace and friendship treaty among Asian countries. In the past 60 years, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have not only taken root in China, India, and Myanmar, but also spread to the hearts of the people. They have also moved towards Asia and the world. China, India, and Myanmar have all made important contributions to this end. China believes that in summing up the practice of international relations, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have great vitality. The Indian side believes that if the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are recognized in the mutual relations of all countries, there will be almost no conflicts and wars in the world. The Myanmar side stated that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are appropriate guiding principles for all countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In the past 60 years, after the test of international changes, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, as an open and inclusive principle of international law, embodies the values ​​of sovereignty, justice, democracy and the rule of law. -The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the basic principles of international relations and the basic principles of international law. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence embodies the essential characteristics of a new type of international relations. It is an interconnected, complementary, and indivisible unity applicable to the relationship between countries with various social systems, development levels, and sizes. In 1955, the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference were the five principles for peaceful coexistence.The relationship between various social systems, levels of development, and size. In 1955, the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference were the extension and development of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. The Non-Aligned Movement, which emerged in the 1960s, used five principles as guiding principles. The relevant declarations adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1970 and 1974 both accepted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been adopted by a series of international organizations and documents in the world today, and have been widely endorsed and observed by the international community. -The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence effectively safeguard the rights and interests of the vast number of developing countries. The essence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is that all countries have equal sovereignty and oppose any country's monopoly on international affairs. This provides a powerful ideological weapon for the vast number of developing countries to defend their national sovereignty and independence. It has become a banner for solidarity and cooperation among the developing countries, and it has deepened mutual understanding and trust among the developing countries, promoted South-South cooperation, and also promoted North and South. Relationship improvement and development. -The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have played an active role in promoting a more just and reasonable international political and economic order. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence abandon the jungle rule of weak meat and strong food, strengthen the anti-imperialist and colonial forces, and accelerate the collapse of the colonial system. Against the backdrop of the East-West Cold War confrontation, the so-called ""big family"", ""group politics"", and ""sphere of influence"" have not dealt with state-to-state relations, but have brought contradictions and intensified the situation. In sharp contrast to this, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have opened up a new path for the peaceful settlement of historical issues and international disputes between nations. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Today, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes. The era of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is becoming stronger. The international community is increasingly becoming a community of destiny between you and me. At the same time, injustices and inequalities in international relations are still very prominent. Global challenges are emerging one after another. Various regional conflicts and local wars are emerging one after another. The people of many countries, especially children, still live in the flames of war. Many developing countries The people are still suffering from hunger and cold. There is still a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. Under the new situation, the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is not outdated, but lasts forever; the significance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is not diminished, but lasts forever; the role of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is not weakened, But it lasts forever. , ""Fan Yi's way, go with the times."" Just now, President Wu Dengsheng and Vice President Ansari both had very good ideas on upholding and promoting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence under the new situation, promoting the construction of a new type of international relations and a better world And advocate. On this issue, China, India and Myanmar have broad consensus. I would like to make a few observations. , First, adhere to sovereign equality. Sovereignty is the fundamental symbol of national independence and the fundamental embodiment and reliable guarantee of national interests. Sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be violated, and countries should respect each other’s core interests and major concerns. These are the last words, they should not be discarded at any time, and should not be shaken at any time. All countries are equal members of the international community regardless of their size, strength, weakness or wealth, and they all have equal rights to participate in international affairs. The affairs of various countries should be managed by the people of all countries. We must respect the social systems and development paths independently chosen by various countries, and oppose the use of illegal means to subvert the legitimate regimes of other countries for the benefit of ourselves or our own views. , Second, adhere to common security. Security should be universal. All countries have equal rights to participate in international and regional security affairs, and all have the responsibility to maintain international and regional security. We must advocate the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and respect and guarantee the security of every country. It is impossible for one country to be safe and other countries to be unsafe, some countries to be safe and others to be unsafe, not to mention the security of other countries in pursuit of their so-called absolute security. We must strengthen international and regional cooperation, jointly address the increasing number of non-traditional security threats, resolutely combat all forms of terrorism, and eradicate the breeding grounds of terrorism. To deal with differences and disputes existing between countries, we must insist on peaceful settlement through dialogue and consultation, increase mutual trust through dialogue, resolve disputes through dialogue, and promote security through dialogue. We must not resort to force or threat of force. Enthusiastic use of force is not a powerful performance, but a morally poor and pale concept. Only security based on morality and philosophy is a solid and lasting security. We must promote the construction of an open, transparent, and equal new framework for Asia-Pacific security cooperation, and promote the common maintenance of regional and world peace and security by all countries. , Third, adhere to common development. The sky is big enough, the earth is big enough, and the world is big enough to allow all countries to develop and prosper together. Some countries are getting richer, while others are chronically poor and backward. This situation is unsustainable. waterLarge enough to allow all countries to develop and prosper together. Some countries are getting richer, while others are chronically poor and backward. This situation is unsustainable. The water rises and the boat rises high, the small river is full of water, and the big river is full. When countries seek their own development, they should actively promote the common development of other countries so that more and better development results can benefit the people of all countries. , We must work together to maintain and develop an open world economy, jointly promote a strong, sustainable, and balanced growth of the world economy, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, adhere to open regional cooperation, oppose all forms of protectionism, and oppose any neighbourhood. , The intention and practice of passing on the crisis. , We must promote South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue, enhance the independent development capabilities of developing countries, promote developed countries to assume more responsibilities, strive to narrow the North-South gap, establish a more equal and balanced new global development partnership, and lay a solid foundation for the long-term stable development of the world economy . Fourth, insist on win-win cooperation. ""Cooperation is strong, and loneliness is weak."" Cooperation and win-win should become the basic policy orientation of all countries in handling international affairs. Cooperation and win-win are generally applicable principles, not only in the economic field, but also in other fields such as politics, security, culture and so on. Therefore, we should combine our national interests with the common interests of all countries, and strive to expand the meeting point of the common interests of all parties. We must actively establish a new concept of win-win, multi-win, and win-win, and abandon the old thinking that you win and lose, and winners take all. ""Everything is beautiful, beauty is beautiful, beauty is common, and the world is the same."" We must stick to the same boat, share power and responsibility, and work together to cope with the increasing global issues such as climate change, energy and resource security, network security, and major natural disasters, so as to jointly protect the earth's homeland on which humanity depends. Fifth, insist on tolerance and mutual learning. The diversity of civilizations is a basic characteristic of human society. The world today has a population of 7 billion, more than 200 countries and regions, more than 2,500 ethnic groups, and more than 5,000 languages. Different nationalities and different civilizations are colorful and have their own strengths and weaknesses. There is no distinction between merits and demerits, only differences in characteristics. , ""Everything is bred without harming each other, and the ways are parallel but not contradictory."" We must respect the diversity of civilizations, promote exchanges and dialogues among different civilizations, peaceful coexistence, and harmonious coexistence. We cannot respect and degrade other civilizations and nations. Human history tells us that trying to build a unified world of a single civilization is just an unrealistic fantasy. , Everyone has his strong and weak points. We must advocate exchanges and mutual learning, pay attention to drawing on the outstanding achievements of civilization created by different countries and different nations, learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and learn from each other's strengths. , Sixth, uphold fairness and justice. ""A trip on the avenue is also for the sake of the world."" Fairness and justice are lofty goals pursued by people of all countries in the field of international relations. In today's international relations, fairness and justice are far from being realized. , We should jointly promote the democratization of international relations. The destiny of the world must be jointly controlled by the people of all countries, and the affairs of the world should be negotiated by the governments and people of all countries. The idea of ​​monopolizing international affairs lags behind the times, and the action of monopolizing international affairs is certainly unsuccessful. , We should jointly promote the rule of law in international relations. Promote all parties to abide by international law and recognized basic principles of international relations in international relations, and use uniformly applicable rules to explain right and wrong, promote peace, and seek development. ""The law, the rule of the world is also."" In the international community, the law should be a common rule, there is no law that only applies to others and does not apply to oneself, and there is no law that only applies to oneself and does not apply to others. Applicable law cannot have double standards. We should jointly maintain the authority and seriousness of international law and international order. All countries should exercise their rights in accordance with the law, oppose the distortion of international law, and oppose the violation of the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and the destruction of peace and stability in the name of ""rule of law."" , We should jointly promote the rationalization of international relations. Adapting to the new changes in international forces and advancing the reform of the global governance system, it reflects the concerns and demands of all parties and better safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of the vast number of developing countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China is an active advocate and firm practitioner of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are enshrined in the Chinese Constitution and are the cornerstone of Chinese foreign policy. China is a participant, builder, and contributor to the contemporary international system. -China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development. Taking the path of peaceful development is a strategic choice made by China according to the trend of the times and its own fundamental interests. The Chinese people advocate ""doing what you don't want, don't do it to others."" China does not agree with the theory of ""national power must be hegemony"", and there is no gene in the Chinese people's bloodline for dominance and domination. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development. This is good for China, good for Asia, and good for the world. No force can shake China’s belief in peaceful development.Going along the path of peaceful development is good for China, good for Asia, and good for the world. No force can shake China's belief in peaceful development. China firmly defends its sovereignty, security and development interests, and also supports other countries, especially the vast number of developing countries, in safeguarding their sovereignty, security and development interests. China adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and will not impose its will on others. Even if it is strong, it will never seek hegemony. China sincerely hopes that other countries will follow the path of peaceful development. Everyone should work together to stabilize this path. -China will unswervingly develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. ""Whereever you are close, you will believe in each other in the near future, and you will be loyal in the future."" China adheres to the concept of pro, honesty, benefit and tolerance, deepens mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries, and strives to better its own development to benefit neighboring countries. . China insists on developing countries as the basis of its foreign policy, adheres to the correct concept of justice and benefit, and will always be a reliable friend and sincere partner of developing countries. China values ​​the status and role of major powers and is committed to developing all-round cooperative relations with major powers, actively developing new major power relations with the United States, developing a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership with Russia, and developing partnerships for peace, growth, reform, and civilization with Europe. Let's all work together to maintain world peace and promote common development. -China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results. China is pushing for the implementation of major cooperation initiatives such as the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, and the China-ASEAN Community of Destiny. The system brings new opportunities and space for the development of Asia and the world. At present, the Chinese people are striving to build a well-off society in an all-round way and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Dream is closely linked to the beautiful dreams of people around the world. The Chinese people are willing to support and help each other in the process of realizing their dreams. China is willing to develop and prosper together with other countries, especially neighboring neighbors. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In order to commend and encourage more people and groups to adhere to and promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, I would like to announce that the Chinese government has decided to establish the ""Friendship Award for Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence"" and the ""Excellent Scholarship for Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence"". , China has an old saying: ""A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.""

尊敬的吴登盛总统，, 尊敬的安萨里副总统，, 尊敬的各位使节、各位嘉宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天，我们在这里隆重集会，纪念和平共处五项原则发表60周年。这是中国、印度、缅甸和国际社会共同的盛会，对弘扬和平共处五项原则、增进各国人民友好合作、促进世界和平与发展，具有重要意义。, 在这里，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，对各位嘉宾和朋友的到来，表示热烈的欢迎！, 刚才，吴登盛总统、安萨里副总统发表了热情洋溢的重要讲话，我对他们的讲话表示高度评价。, 60年前，在第二次世界大战结束后兴起的非殖民化运动中，亚非拉民族独立解放事业蓬勃发展，新生的国家渴望建立平等的国际关系。中国、印度、缅甸顺应这一历史潮流，共同倡导了互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则。, 1954年6月28日和29日，中印、中缅分别发表联合声明，确认这五项原则将在相互关系以及各自国家同亚洲及世界其他国家的关系中予以适用。这是国际关系史上的重大创举，为推动建立公正合理的新型国际关系作出了历史性贡献。, 抚今追昔，我们对共同倡导和平共处五项原则的三国老一辈领导人表示深切的缅怀，对长期以来坚持弘扬和平共处五项原则的各国有识之士，致以崇高的敬意！, 今天，我们共同纪念和平共处五项原则发表60周年，就是要探讨新形势下如何更好弘扬这五项原则，推动建立新型国际关系，共同建设合作共赢的美好世界。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 和平共处五项原则之所以在亚洲诞生，是因为它传承了亚洲人民崇尚和平的思想传统。中华民族历来崇尚“和为贵”、“和而不同”、“协和万邦”、“兼爱非攻”等理念。印度、缅甸等亚洲国家人民也历来崇尚仁爱、慈善、和平等价值观。印度伟大诗人泰戈尔用诗歌的语言写道：“你以为用战争可以获取友谊？春天就会从眼前姗姗而去。”缅甸人民建立了和平塔，用来祈祷世界和平。, 和平共处五项原则生动反映了联合国宪章宗旨和原则，并赋予这些宗旨和原则以可见、可行、可依循的内涵。和平共处五项原则中包含4个“互”字、1个“共”字，既代表了亚洲国家对国际关系的新期待，也体现了各国权利、义务、责任相统一的国际法治精神。, 上个世纪50年代，在和平共处五项原则指导下，中印友好之风吹遍了两国广袤大地。当年，周恩来总理访问印度时，到处可以听到“潘查希拉金达巴”（五项原则万岁）、“印地秦尼巴伊巴伊”（印中人民是兄弟）的欢呼声。中缅在和平共处五项原则指导下妥善解决了边界问题，1960年两国签署边界条约，这是新中国同周边邻国签订的第一个边界条约。中缅两国还签署了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，这是亚洲国家间首个和平友好条约。, 60年来，和平共处五项原则不仅在中国、印度、缅甸生根发芽、深入人心，而且走向亚洲、走向世界，中国、印度、缅甸都为此作出了重要贡献。中方认为，总结国际关系实践，和平共处五项原则是具有强大生命力的。印方认为，如果和平共处五项原则在所有国家相互关系中获得认可，那么世界就几乎不会有任何冲突和战争。缅方表示，和平共处五项原则对一切国家都是适当的指导原则。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 60年来，历经国际风云变幻的考验，和平共处五项原则作为一个开放包容的国际法原则，集中体现了主权、正义、民主、法治的价值观。, ——和平共处五项原则已经成为国际关系基本准则和国际法基本原则。和平共处五项原则精辟体现了新型国际关系的本质特征，是一个相互联系、相辅相成、不可分割的统一体，适用于各种社会制度、发展水平、体量规模国家之间的关系。1955年，万隆会议通过的十项原则是对和平共处五项原则的引申和发展。上个世纪60年代兴起的不结盟运动把五项原则作为指导原则。1970年和1974年联合国大会通过的有关宣言都接受了和平共处五项原则。和平共处五项原则为当今世界一系列国际组织和国际文件所采纳，得到国际社会广泛赞同和遵守。, ——和平共处五项原则有力维护了广大发展中国家权益。和平共处五项原则的精髓，就是所有国家主权一律平等，反对任何国家垄断国际事务。这为广大发展中国家捍卫国家主权和独立提供了强大思想武器，成为发展中国家团结合作、联合自强的旗帜，加深了广大发展中国家相互理解和信任，促进了南南合作，也推动了南北关系改善和发展。, ——和平共处五项原则为推动建立更加公正合理的国际政治经济秩序发挥了积极作用。和平共处五项原则摒弃了弱肉强食的丛林法则，壮大了反帝反殖力量，加速了殖民体系崩溃瓦解。在东西方冷战对峙的大背景下，所谓“大家庭”、“集团政治”、“势力范围”等方式都没有处理好国与国关系，反而带来了矛盾、激化了局势。与之形成鲜明对照的是，和平共处五项原则为和平解决国家间历史遗留问题及国际争端开辟了崭新道路。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当今世界正在发生深刻复杂的变化，和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流更加强劲，国际社会日益成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。同时，国际关系中的不公正不平等现象仍很突出，全球性挑战层出不穷，各种地区冲突和局部战争此起彼伏，不少国家的民众特别是儿童依然生活在战火硝烟之中，不少发展中国家人民依然承受着饥寒的煎熬。维护世界和平、促进共同发展，依然任重道远。, 新形势下，和平共处五项原则的精神不是过时了，而是历久弥新；和平共处五项原则的意义不是淡化了，而是历久弥深；和平共处五项原则的作用不是削弱了，而是历久弥坚。, “凡益之道，与时偕行。”刚才，吴登盛总统、安萨里副总统都对新形势下坚持和弘扬和平共处五项原则、推动建设新型国际关系和美好世界谈了很好的想法和主张。在这个问题上，中国、印度、缅甸有着广泛共识。我愿谈几点看法。, 第一，坚持主权平等。主权是国家独立的根本标志，也是国家利益的根本体现和可靠保证。主权和领土完整不容侵犯，各国应该尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切。这些都是硬道理，任何时候都不能丢弃，任何时候都不应动摇。, 国家不分大小、强弱、贫富，都是国际社会平等成员，都有平等参与国际事务的权利。各国的事务应该由各国人民自己来管。我们要尊重各国自主选择的社会制度和发展道路，反对出于一己之利或一己之见，采用非法手段颠覆别国合法政权。, 第二，坚持共同安全。安全应该是普遍的。各国都有平等参与国际和地区安全事务的权利，也都有维护国际和地区安全的责任。我们要倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的理念，尊重和保障每一个国家的安全。不能一个国家安全而其他国家不安全，一部分国家安全而另一部分国家不安全，更不能牺牲别国安全谋求自身所谓绝对安全。我们要加强国际和地区合作，共同应对日益增多的非传统安全威胁，坚决打击一切形式的恐怖主义，铲除恐怖主义滋生的土壤。, 对待国家间存在的分歧和争端，要坚持通过对话协商以和平方式解决，以对话增互信，以对话解纷争，以对话促安全，不能动辄诉诸武力或以武力相威胁。热衷于使用武力，不是强大的表现，而是道义贫乏、理念苍白的表现。只有基于道义、理念的安全，才是基础牢固、真正持久的安全。我们要推动建设开放、透明、平等的亚太安全合作新架构，推动各国共同维护地区和世界和平安全。, 第三，坚持共同发展。天空足够大，地球足够大，世界也足够大，容得下各国共同发展繁荣。一些国家越来越富裕，另一些国家长期贫穷落后，这样的局面是不可持续的。水涨船高，小河有水大河满，大家发展才能发展大家。各国在谋求自身发展时，应该积极促进其他国家共同发展，让发展成果更多更好惠及各国人民。, 我们要共同维护和发展开放型世界经济，共同促进世界经济强劲、可持续、平衡增长，推动贸易和投资自由化便利化，坚持开放的区域合作，反对各种形式的保护主义，反对任何以邻为壑、转嫁危机的意图和做法。, 我们要推动南南合作和南北对话，增强发展中国家自主发展能力，推动发达国家承担更多责任，努力缩小南北差距，建立更加平等均衡的新型全球发展伙伴关系，夯实世界经济长期稳定发展基础。, 第四，坚持合作共赢。“合则强，孤则弱。”合作共赢应该成为各国处理国际事务的基本政策取向。合作共赢是普遍适用的原则，不仅适用于经济领域，而且适用于政治、安全、文化等其他领域。, 我们应该把本国利益同各国共同利益结合起来，努力扩大各方共同利益的汇合点，不能这边搭台、那边拆台，要相互补台、好戏连台。要积极树立双赢、多赢、共赢的新理念，摒弃你输我赢、赢者通吃的旧思维，“各美其美，美人之美，美美与共，天下大同”。, 我们要坚持同舟共济、权责共担，携手应对气候变化、能源资源安全、网络安全、重大自然灾害等日益增多的全球性问题，共同呵护人类赖以生存的地球家园。, 第五，坚持包容互鉴。文明多样性是人类社会的基本特征。当今世界有70亿人口，200多个国家和地区，2500多个民族，5000多种语言。不同民族、不同文明多姿多彩、各有千秋，没有优劣之分，只有特色之别。, “万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。”我们要尊重文明多样性，推动不同文明交流对话、和平共处、和谐共生，不能唯我独尊、贬低其他文明和民族。人类历史告诉我们，企图建立单一文明的一统天下，只是一种不切实际的幻想。, 尺有所短，寸有所长。我们要倡导交流互鉴，注重汲取不同国家、不同民族创造的优秀文明成果，取长补短，兼收并蓄，共同绘就人类文明美好画卷。, 第六，坚持公平正义。“大道之行也，天下为公。”公平正义是世界各国人民在国际关系领域追求的崇高目标。在当今国际关系中，公平正义还远远没有实现。, 我们应该共同推动国际关系民主化。世界的命运必须由各国人民共同掌握，世界上的事情应该由各国政府和人民共同商量来办。垄断国际事务的想法是落后于时代的，垄断国际事务的行动也肯定是不能成功的。, 我们应该共同推动国际关系法治化。推动各方在国际关系中遵守国际法和公认的国际关系基本原则，用统一适用的规则来明是非、促和平、谋发展。“法者，天下之准绳也。”在国际社会中，法律应该是共同的准绳，没有只适用他人、不适用自己的法律，也没有只适用自己、不适用他人的法律。适用法律不能有双重标准。我们应该共同维护国际法和国际秩序的权威性和严肃性，各国都应该依法行使权利，反对歪曲国际法，反对以“法治”之名行侵害他国正当权益、破坏和平稳定之实。, 我们应该共同推动国际关系合理化。适应国际力量对比新变化推进全球治理体系改革，体现各方关切和诉求，更好维护广大发展中国家正当权益。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国是和平共处五项原则的积极倡导者和坚定实践者。和平共处五项原则载入了中国宪法，是中国外交政策的基石。中国是当代国际体系的参与者、建设者、贡献者。, ——中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路。走和平发展道路是中国根据时代发展潮流和自身根本利益作出的战略抉择。中国人民崇尚“己所不欲，勿施于人”。中国不认同“国强必霸论”，中国人的血脉中没有称王称霸、穷兵黩武的基因。中国将坚定不移沿着和平发展道路走下去，这对中国有利，对亚洲有利，对世界也有利，任何力量都不能动摇中国和平发展的信念。中国坚定维护自身的主权、安全、发展利益，也支持其他国家特别是广大发展中国家维护自身的主权、安全、发展利益。中国坚持不干涉别国内政原则，不会把自己的意志强加于人，即使再强大也永远不称霸。中国真诚希望其他国家都走和平发展道路，大家携手把这条路走稳走好。, ——中国将坚定不移在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同世界各国的友好合作。“凡交，近则必相靡以信，远则必忠之以言。”中国坚持按照亲、诚、惠、容的理念，深化同周边国家的互利合作，努力使自身发展更好惠及周边国家。中国坚持把发展中国家作为对外政策的基础，坚持正确义利观，永远做发展中国家的可靠朋友和真诚伙伴。中国重视各大国的地位和作用，致力于同各大国发展全方位合作关系，积极同美国发展新型大国关系，同俄罗斯发展全面战略协作伙伴关系，同欧洲发展和平、增长、改革、文明伙伴关系，大家一起来维护世界和平、促进共同发展。, ——中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略。中国正在推动落实丝绸之路经济带、21世纪海上丝绸之路、孟中印缅经济走廊、中国—东盟命运共同体等重大合作倡议，中国将以此为契机全面推进新一轮对外开放，发展开放型经济体系，为亚洲和世界发展带来新的机遇和空间。, 当前，中国人民正在为全面建成小康社会、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。中国梦同世界各国人民的美好梦想息息相通，中国人民愿意同各国人民在实现各自梦想的过程中相互支持、相互帮助，中国愿意同各国尤其是周边邻国共同发展、共同繁荣。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 为表彰和鼓励更多人士和团体坚持和弘扬和平共处五项原则，我愿宣布，中国政府决定设立“和平共处五项原则友谊奖”和“和平共处五项原则卓越奖学金”。, 中国有句古话：“千里之行，始于足下。”印度有句谚语：“水滴汇成溪，稻穗集成束。”缅甸人常说：“想，要凌云壮志；干，要脚踏实地。”中国将继续做弘扬和平共处五项原则的表率，同印度、缅甸和国际社会一道，推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界！, 谢谢大家。, ]",弘扬和平共处五项原则　建设合作共赢美好世界,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/25214109
37,153,"[, Dear King Philip and his wife, Dear Chairman Fan Longpei, Dear Prime Minister Di Lupo, Dear Chairman De Vigo and Dean Monal, Dear Diplomats, Teachers and Classmates,, Ladies and gentlemen, friends:, 　　 Hello everyone! It is a pleasure to meet you at the European Academy. First of all, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to the teachers and classmates of the college and to all European friends who care about and support the development of China! , 　　 In Flemish, Bruges means ""bridge"". The bridge is not only convenient for everyone's life, but also a symbol of communication, understanding and friendship. My current trip to Europe was to build a bridge of friendship and cooperation with friends from Europe and Asia. , 　　 Just now, I visited the Volvo Car Factory in Ghent together with King Philip and his wife. This factory is the largest automobile manufacturer in Belgium and a model of economic and technological cooperation among China, Belgium and Sweden. It has built a bridge of mutual benefit and win-win between ""Chinese investment"" and ""European technology"". , 　　The European Academy was born after the end of the Second World War. It is a product of people reflecting on war and longing for peace. Human history is always accompanied by war spells. The brutality of the Second World War prompted the European people to ponder their pains. Under the leadership of a group of politicians such as Jean Monet and Robert Schumann, they began to unite and strengthen themselves, striving for lasting peace and prosperity. , 　　 After more than half a century of development, the European Academy has not only become an important think tank for the European Union, but also a ""cradle of European political elites."" Mr. Fan Longpei said that the European Academy ""has always been at the core of European integration,"" reflecting ""European beliefs born on the ruins of war."" , 　　 teachers and students! , 　　In 1949 when the European Academy was founded, the People's Republic of China was established, and the development of the Chinese nation has since opened a new historical era. In 1975, Premier Zhou Enlai and Sir Soms took the situation and made a decision to establish diplomatic relations between China and Europe. At present, China and Europe have established a comprehensive strategic partnership and established a dialogue and consultation mechanism in more than 60 fields. In 2013, the trade volume between the two sides reached US$559.1 billion, with more than 5 million personnel exchanges each year and nearly 300,000 international students. China-EU relations have become one of the most influential bilateral relations in the world. At the same time, we must also see that China-EU relations have a lot of room for development and their potential is far from being realized. In order to advance China-EU relations, China needs to deepen its understanding of Europe, and the EU also needs to deepen its understanding of China. History is the root of reality. Today in any country comes from yesterday. Only by knowing where a country comes from can we understand how this country is today instead of that, and we can understand where the country will go and where it will not go in the future. , 　　 Taking this opportunity, I would like to tell you what kind of country China is. I hope it will help you observe China, study China, and understand China. Introducing China is a big topic. I choose to talk about some of the most significant characteristics of China. , 　　 First, China is a country with a long civilization. Among the world's major ancient civilizations, the Chinese civilization has been uninterrupted and continues to develop to this day. It has a history of more than 5,000 years. The words created by our ancestors thousands of years ago are still in use today. More than 2,000 years ago, China had the grandeur of hundreds of schools of thought. Laozi, Confucius, Mozi, and other thinkers studied astronomy and poor geography, extensively discussed the true meaning of the relationship between people, people, society, and nature. Broad and profound ideological system. Many of the ideas they put forward, such as filial piety, faithfulness, honesty, benevolence, benevolence, benevolence, harmony between man and nature, natural law and self-improvement, are still deeply affecting the lives of Chinese people. Chinese people have a unique value system for the world, society and life. The unique and long spiritual world of the Chinese has given the Chinese a strong sense of national self-confidence, and has also cultivated a national spirit centered on patriotism. , 　　 Second, China is a country that has experienced deep suffering. In the thousands of years before the industrial revolution, China's economy, science and technology, and culture have been walking in the world's first phalanx. After modern times, China's feudal ruler Yelang was arrogant and closed-door, leading China to lag behind the development of the times, and China gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Foreign powers have continuously invaded, Chinese society is turbulent, and the people live in extreme poverty. The poor is thinking, and the chaos is thinking. The Chinese people finally took control of their own destiny after paying tremendous sacrifices of tens of millions of casualties after unyielding struggles that took place more than a hundred years ago.Change, chaos is thinking. The Chinese people have finally taken control of their own destiny after making unremitting struggles over hundreds of years ago and paying huge sacrifices for tens of millions of casualties. The Chinese people have a fresh memory of the history of aggression and enslavement, and especially cherish life today. The Chinese people hope for peace and oppose war. Therefore, they have always pursued an independent foreign policy of peace and insisted on not interfering in other countries’ internal affairs or allowing others to interfere in China’s internal affairs. We have been doing this in the past and will continue to do so in the future.　　 Third, China is a country that implements socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 1911, the 1911 Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen overthrew the monarchy that ruled China for thousands of years. The old system is overthrown. Where is China going? The Chinese are struggling to find a way that suits China's national conditions. The constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the imperial system, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, and the presidential system have all been thought and tried, and the results will not work. Finally, China chose the socialist road. In the practice of building socialism, we have had successes and mistakes, and even experienced serious setbacks. After reform and opening up, under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, we proceeded from China's national conditions and the requirements of the times, explored and opened up the development path of the country, formed socialism with Chinese characteristics, and proposed to build a socialist market economy, democratic politics, advanced culture, and a harmonious society. Ecological civilization, maintaining social fairness and justice, promoting all-round development of people, adhering to peaceful development, building a well-off society in an all-round way, and then realizing modernization and gradually realizing the common prosperity of all people. The unique cultural tradition, unique historical destiny, and unique national conditions doomed China to inevitably follow a development path suited to its own characteristics. We have embarked on such a path and achieved success. , 　　 Fourth, China is the largest developing country in the world. China has made historic progress in development, and its economic aggregate has leapt to the second place in the world. As a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, China spent decades to complete the development process that developed countries have traveled for hundreds of years. It is undoubtedly proud and proud. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that although China's total economic volume is large, divided by more than 1.3 billion people, its per capita GDP is still ranked around the 80th in the world. There are more than 74 million people in China's urban and rural subsistence allowances, and there are more than 10 million new labors in urban areas every year. Hundreds of millions of rural labors need to transfer jobs and settle in cities and towns. There are more than 85 million people with disabilities. According to World Bank standards, China has more than 200 million people living below the poverty line, which is almost equivalent to the total population of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the 40 days before and after the Spring Festival this year, China's aviation, railways, and highways carried about 3.6 billion people, equivalent to 90 million people moving every day. Therefore, it will take long and hard work for more than 1.3 billion people to lead a good life. China’s current central task is still economic construction, and to promote social progress on the basis of economic development.　　 Fifth, China is a country undergoing profound changes. Our ancestors have long put forward the idea of ​​""health in heaven, and gentlemen strive for self-improvement"", emphasizing the need to ""go new every day, every day new, and every day new"". Moving forward in fierce international competition is like sailing against the current. The reform is caused by the problem, and it is deepened in the continuous solution of the problem. We emphasize that reform and opening up can only be carried out when it is not completed. China has entered the deep water zone of reform, and it is difficult to chew the hard bones that need to be resolved. At this time, it requires the courage of ""knowing that there are tigers in the mountains and leaning towards the mountains"", and constantly push forward the reform. Our principle for advancing reform is to be bold and steady. ""Pictures are harder to change than to be detailed. The world's hard things must be made easy; the world's big things must be made detailed."" As China's reforms continue to advance, China will continue to undergo profound changes. At the same time, I also believe that China's comprehensive deepening of reforms will not only provide a powerful driving force for China's modernization drive, but also bring new development opportunities to the world. In short, to observe and understand China, we must look at history and reality, as well as material and spiritual. The Chinese nation has more than 5,000 years of civilization, the Chinese people have more than 170 years of struggle since modern times, the Communist Party has more than 90 years of struggle, the People’s Republic of China has more than 60 years of development, and the reform and opening up has more than 30 years of exploration. These history are inseparable. It is difficult to correctly understand China without the history of China, the culture of China, the spiritual world of the Chinese, and the profound changes in contemporary China. , 　　 The world is multi-dimensional, and the history of the world is not going forward in a single line. China cannot completely copy the political systems and development models of other countries, otherwise it will not only be unacceptable, but also have disastrous consequences. Chinese people realized this truth more than 2000 years ago: ""Orange is Huai'nan when it is orange, and it is Huaibei when it is Citrus aurantium. Ye Tu is similar, but actually has a different taste.as a result of. Chinese people realized this truth more than 2,000 years ago: ""Oranges are produced as oranges in Huainan, and as oranges in Huaibei. Ye Tu is similar, but the taste is different. So what is the difference? The soil and water are different."", a French writer said, Friends see friends are transparent, they exchange lives with each other. I hope my introduction will make China more transparent in front of you. I sincerely hope that the European Academy can train a large number of talents who understand China and understand China, and provide talents and intellectual support for the continuous development of China-EU relations. , 　　 teachers and students! , 　　 Although China and Europe are thousands of miles apart, they all live in the same time and in the same space, and their lives are closely related. At present, both China and Europe are in a critical period of development and are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Just now, I said that we hope to work with European friends to build a bridge of friendship and cooperation in Asia and Europe. We must work together to build the four bridges of peace, growth, reform, and civilization, and build a more comprehensive global strategic partnership between China and Europe. , 　　-We want to build a bridge of peace and stability, connecting the two major forces of China and Europe. China and the EU account for one tenth of the world’s area and one quarter of the world’s population, and have three permanent seats in the UN Security Council. It is the consensus of both parties to want peace and not war, multilateral and unilateral, and dialogue and confrontation. We must strengthen communication and coordination on global issues and play a key role in maintaining world peace and stability. Civilized culture can be spread, as can peaceful development. China is willing to work with the EU to let the sunshine of peace drive away the haze of war, let the prosperous bonfire warm the spring and cold of the world economy, and promote the path of peaceful development and win-win cooperation for all mankind. , 　　-We want to build a bridge of growth and prosperity, connecting the two major markets of China and Europe. The total economic volume of China and the EU accounts for one-third of the world, and is the world's two most important economies. We must jointly uphold the opening of the market, accelerate the negotiation of investment agreements, actively explore the construction of free trade zones, and strive to achieve the ambitious goal of reaching a trade volume of US$1 trillion by 2020. We must also actively discuss combining China-EU cooperation with the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt, with the goal of building a large Asia-Europe market, so that people, enterprises, capital, and technology on the two continents will live and fire, making China and the European Union become The twin engines of world economic growth. , 　　-We must build a bridge of reform and progress and connect the two major reform processes between China and Europe. Both China and the European Union are undergoing an unprecedented reform process in human history, and they are both on the road that no one has ever traveled before. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and cooperation in the fields of macroeconomics, public policy, regional development, rural development, social and people's livelihood, respect the reform path of both sides, learn from the reform experience of both sides, and drive world development and progress with their own reforms. , 　　-We want to build a bridge of civilization and common prosperity, connecting the two civilizations of China and Europe. China is an important representative of Eastern civilization, and Europe is the birthplace of Western civilization. Just as the Chinese love tea and the Belgians love beer, the implicit restraint of tea and the enthusiasm of wine represent two different ways to taste life and interpret the world. However, tea and wine are not incompatible. You can drink wine for a thousand friends, or you can taste tea and taste your life. China advocates ""harmony and difference"", while the EU emphasizes ""multiple integration."" China and Europe must work together to promote the blossoming of human civilizations. No matter how the international situation changes, China always supports the process of European integration and always supports a united, stable and prosperous EU to play a greater role in international affairs. China is about to publish its second EU policy document, reiterating China's high priority for the EU and developing China-EU relations. Last year, China and Europe jointly formulated the 2020 strategic plan for China-EU cooperation and put forward a series of ambitious cooperation goals in nearly 100 fields. The two sides should work together to turn the blueprint into reality as soon as possible to make China-EU relations better in the next 10 years. , 　　 teachers and students! , 　　 In recent years, the European Academy has paid more and more attention to China, has set up courses on European-Chinese relations, and is actively preparing for the establishment of a European-Chinese research center dedicated to the study of European-Chinese relations. China has decided to jointly build China’s first “China Pavilion” in the European Union with the European Academy and provide 10,000 volumes of books and films that introduce the development of Chinese history and culture in various fields for academic research. , 　　 ""Read thousands of books"" and ""walk thousands of miles"". It is recommended that students go to China to see more. Hearing is false, and seeing is believing. China is willing to work with the European side to achieve an annual two-way exchange of 300,000 Chinese and European students by 2020. , 　　Youth is the most energetic and full of dreams. The future of China belongs to the younger generation, the future of Europe belongs to the younger generation, and the future of the world belongs to the younger generation. I hope that students from China and Europe will use equality and respectThe future belongs to the younger generation, the future of Europe belongs to the younger generation, and the future of the world belongs to the younger generation. I hope that the students from China and Europe will look at the world with equality, respect and love, look at the different civilizations in the world with an attitude of appreciation, tolerance and mutual learning, promote mutual understanding and understanding between the Chinese and European people, and promote the cooperation between China and Europe. The mutual understanding and understanding of the people of other countries in the world, with the vigor and struggle of youth, makes the planet we live in better. ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News

　　欧洲学院诞生于第二次世界大战结束之后，是人们反思战争、渴望和平的产物。人类历史总是伴随着战争魔咒。第二次世界大战的惨烈，促使欧洲人民痛定思痛，在让·莫内、罗伯特·舒曼等一批政治家领导下，开始联合自强，为实现持久和平与繁荣而奋斗。, 　　经过半个多世纪发展，欧洲学院不仅成为欧盟的重要智库，而且成为“欧洲政治精英的摇篮”。范龙佩先生说，欧洲学院“始终位于欧洲一体化的核心”，体现了“在战争废墟上诞生的欧洲信念”。, 　　老师们、同学们！, 　　就在欧洲学院成立的1949年，中华人民共和国成立了，中华民族的发展从此开启了新的历史纪元。1975年，周恩来总理和索姆斯爵士审时度势，作出了中欧建交的决定。现在，中欧建立了全面战略伙伴关系，在60多个领域建立了对话磋商机制；2013年双方贸易额达到5591亿美元，双方每年人员往来500多万人次，留学生总数近30万人。中欧关系已经成为世界上最具影响力的双边关系之一。, 　　同时，我们也要看到，中欧关系发展空间还很大，潜力还远远没有发挥出来。为了把中欧关系推向前进，中方需要加深对欧洲的了解，欧方也需要加深对中国的了解。历史是现实的根源，任何一个国家的今天都来自昨天。只有了解一个国家从哪里来，才能弄懂这个国家今天怎么会是这样而不是那样，也才能搞清楚这个国家未来会往哪里去和不会往哪里去。, 　　借此机会，我想给大家谈谈中国是一个什么样的国家，希望有助于大家观察中国、研究中国、认识中国。介绍中国是一个很大的课题，我选择中国几个最显著的特点来讲讲。, 　　第一，中国是有着悠久文明的国家。在世界几大古代文明中，中华文明是没有中断、延续发展至今的文明，已经有5000多年历史了。我们的祖先在几千年前创造的文字至今仍在使用。2000多年前，中国就出现了诸子百家的盛况，老子、孔子、墨子等思想家上究天文、下穷地理，广泛探讨人与人、人与社会、人与自然关系的真谛，提出了博大精深的思想体系。他们提出的很多理念，如孝悌忠信、礼义廉耻、仁者爱人、与人为善、天人合一、道法自然、自强不息等，至今仍然深深影响着中国人的生活。中国人看待世界、看待社会、看待人生，有自己独特的价值体系。中国人独特而悠久的精神世界，让中国人具有很强的民族自信心，也培育了以爱国主义为核心的民族精神。, 　　第二，中国是经历了深重苦难的国家。在工业革命发生前的几千年时间里，中国经济、科技、文化一直走在世界的第一方阵之中。近代以后，中国的封建统治者夜郎自大、闭关锁国，导致中国落后于时代发展步伐，中国逐步成为半殖民地半封建社会。外国列强入侵不断，中国社会动荡不已，人民生活极度贫困。穷则思变，乱则思定。中国人民经过逾百年前赴后继的不屈抗争，付出几千万人伤亡的巨大牺牲，终于掌握了自己的命运。中国人民对被侵略、被奴役的历史记忆犹新，尤其珍惜今天的生活。中国人民希望和平、反对战争，所以始终奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持不干涉别国内政、也不允许别人干涉中国内政。我们过去一直是这样做的，今后也会这样做下去。, 　　第三，中国是实行中国特色社会主义的国家。1911年，孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命，推翻了统治中国几千年的君主专制制度。旧的制度推翻了，中国向何处去？中国人苦苦寻找适合中国国情的道路。君主立宪制、复辟帝制、议会制、多党制、总统制都想过了、试过了，结果都行不通。最后，中国选择了社会主义道路。在建设社会主义实践中，我们有成功也有失误，甚至发生过严重曲折。改革开放以后，在邓小平先生领导下，我们从中国国情和时代要求出发，探索和开拓国家发展道路，形成了中国特色社会主义，提出要建设社会主义市场经济、民主政治、先进文化、和谐社会、生态文明，维护社会公平正义，促进人的全面发展，坚持和平发展，全面建成小康社会，进而实现现代化，逐步实现全体人民共同富裕。独特的文化传统，独特的历史命运，独特的国情，注定了中国必然走适合自己特点的发展道路。我们走出了这样一条道路，并且取得了成功。, 　　第四，中国是世界上最大的发展中国家。中国发展取得了历史性进步，经济总量已经跃升到世界第二位。作为有着13亿多人口的国家，中国用几十年的时间走完了发达国家几百年走过的发展历程，无疑是值得骄傲和自豪的。同时，我们也清醒认识到，中国经济总量虽大，但除以13亿多人口，人均国内生产总值还排在世界第八十位左右。中国城乡低保人口有7400多万人，每年城镇新增劳动力有1000多万人，几亿农村劳动力需要转移就业和落户城镇，还有8500多万残疾人。根据世界银行的标准，中国还有2亿多人口生活在贫困线以下，这差不多相当于法国、德国、英国人口的总和。今年春节前后的40天里，中国航空、铁路、公路承载了大约36亿人次的流动，相当于每天都有9000万人在流动之中。所以，让13亿多人都过上好日子，还需要付出长期的艰苦努力。中国目前的中心任务依然是经济建设，并在经济发展的基础上推动社会全面进步。, 　　第五，中国是正在发生深刻变革的国家。我们的先人早就提出了“天行健，君子以自强不息”的思想，强调要“苟日新，日日新，又日新”。在激烈的国际竞争中前行，就如同逆水行舟，不进则退。改革是由问题倒逼而产生，又在不断解决问题中而深化。我们强调，改革开放只有进行时、没有完成时。中国已经进入改革的深水区，需要解决的都是难啃的硬骨头，这个时候需要“明知山有虎，偏向虎山行”的勇气，不断把改革推向前进。我们推进改革的原则是胆子要大、步子要稳。“图难于其易，为大于其细。天下难事，必作于易；天下大事，必作于细。”随着中国改革不断推进，中国必将继续发生深刻变化。同时，我也相信，中国全面深化改革，不仅将为中国现代化建设提供强大推动力量，而且将为世界带来新的发展机遇。, 　　总之，观察和认识中国，历史和现实都要看，物质和精神也都要看。中华民族5000多年文明史，中国人民近代以来170多年斗争史，中国共产党90多年奋斗史，中华人民共和国60多年发展史，改革开放30多年探索史，这些历史一脉相承，不可割裂。脱离了中国的历史，脱离了中国的文化，脱离了中国人的精神世界，脱离了当代中国的深刻变革，是难以正确认识中国的。, 　　世界是多向度发展的，世界历史更不是单线式前进的。中国不能全盘照搬别国的政治制度和发展模式，否则的话不仅会水土不服，而且会带来灾难性后果。2000多年前中国人就认识到了这个道理：“橘生淮南则为橘，生于淮北则为枳，叶徒相似，其实味不同。所以然者何？水土异也。”, 　　有一个法国作家说，朋友看朋友是透明的，他们彼此交换生命。希望我的介绍能够让中国在你们眼前更透明一些。我也真诚希望，欧洲学院能够培养出大批了解中国、理解中国的人才，为中欧关系发展源源不断提供人才和智力支撑。, 　　老师们、同学们！, 　　中国和欧洲虽然远隔万里，但都生活在同一个时间、同一个空间之内，生活息息相关。当前，中欧都处于发展的关键时期，都面临着前所未有的机遇和挑战。刚才，我说到我们希望同欧洲朋友一道，在亚欧大陆架起一座友谊和合作之桥。我们要共同努力建造和平、增长、改革、文明四座桥梁，建设更具全球影响力的中欧全面战略伙伴关系。, 　　——我们要建设和平稳定之桥，把中欧两大力量连接起来。中国和欧盟面积占世界十分之一，人口占世界四分之一，在联合国安理会拥有3个常任理事国席位。要和平不要战争、要多边不要单边、要对话不要对抗是双方的共识。我们要加强在全球性问题上的沟通和协调，为维护世界和平稳定发挥关键性作用。文明文化可以传播，和平发展也可以传播。中国愿意同欧盟一道，让和平的阳光驱走战争的阴霾，让繁荣的篝火温暖世界经济的春寒，促进全人类走上和平发展、合作共赢的道路。, 　　——我们要建设增长繁荣之桥，把中欧两大市场连接起来。中国和欧盟经济总量占世界三分之一，是世界最重要的两大经济体。我们要共同坚持市场开放，加快投资协定谈判，积极探讨自由贸易区建设，努力实现到2020年双方贸易额达到10000亿美元的宏伟目标。我们还要积极探讨把中欧合作和丝绸之路经济带建设结合起来，以构建亚欧大市场为目标，让亚欧两大洲人员、企业、资金、技术活起来、火起来，使中国和欧盟成为世界经济增长的双引擎。, 　　——我们要建设改革进步之桥，把中欧两大改革进程连接起来。中国和欧盟都在经历人类历史上前所未有的改革进程，都在走前人没有走过的路。双方要加强在宏观经济、公共政策、区域发展、农村发展、社会民生等领域对话和合作，尊重双方的改革道路，借鉴双方的改革经验，以自身改革带动世界发展进步。, 　　——我们要建设文明共荣之桥，把中欧两大文明连接起来。中国是东方文明的重要代表，欧洲则是西方文明的发祥地。正如中国人喜欢茶而比利时人喜爱啤酒一样，茶的含蓄内敛和酒的热烈奔放代表了品味生命、解读世界的两种不同方式。但是，茶和酒并不是不可兼容的，既可以酒逢知己千杯少，也可以品茶品味品人生。中国主张“和而不同”，而欧盟强调“多元一体”。中欧要共同努力，促进人类各种文明之花竞相绽放。, 　　无论国际风云如何变幻，中国始终支持欧洲一体化进程，始终支持一个团结、稳定、繁荣的欧盟在国际事务中发挥更大作用。中国即将发表第二份对欧盟政策文件，重申中国对欧盟和发展中欧关系的高度重视。去年，中欧共同制定了中欧合作2020战略规划，在近百个领域提出了一系列具有雄心的合作目标。双方应该一道努力，尽早把蓝图变为现实，让未来10年的中欧关系更加美好。, 　　老师们、同学们！, 　　近年来，欧洲学院日益重视中国，开设了欧中关系课程，还积极筹建欧中研究中心，致力于欧中关系研究。中方决定同欧洲学院共建中国在欧盟国家的第一个“中国馆”，提供1万册介绍中国历史、文化等各领域发展情况的图书和影视片用于学术研究。, 　　“读万卷书”，还要“行万里路”。建议同学们多到中国去看看。耳闻是虚，眼观为实。中国愿同欧方一道努力，争取到2020年实现中欧学生年度双向交流达到30万人次。, 　　青年最富有朝气、最富有梦想。中国的未来属于年轻一代，欧洲的未来属于年轻一代，世界的未来属于年轻一代。希望中欧双方的同学们用平等、尊重、爱心来看待这个世界，用欣赏、包容、互鉴的态度来看待世界上的不同文明，促进中国和欧洲人民的相互了解和理解，促进中国、欧洲同世界其他国家人民的相互了解和理解，用青春的活力和青春的奋斗，让我们生活的这个星球变得更加美好。, 　　谢谢大家。,

38,163,"[, On the eve of attending the sixth meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries, paying state visits to Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Cuba and attending the meeting of leaders of China-Latin America and Caribbean countries, President Xi Jinping accepted the Brazilian Economic Value News, A joint interview with Argentina’s National Daily, Venezuela’s National News Agency, and the Cuban Latin American News Agency, elaborated on BRICS cooperation, China’s bilateral relations with the four countries, China-Latin America relations, democratization of international relations, China’s reform and development, China’s foreign policy and international role, etc. Views and opinions. The full text is as follows:, Q: BRICS cooperation has gone through 5 years. How do you evaluate the cooperation of the BRICS countries in the past 5 years and how to strengthen them in the future? What do you expect from this meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries Fortaleza? With the slowdown or even stagnation of economic development in developed countries, the BRICS countries have high hopes. How do you think the BRICS countries can overcome the problem of large internal differences and become the engine of global economic development? A: Over the past five years, the BRICS countries have formed a multi-level and wide-ranging cooperation framework led by the leaders' meeting. The political mutual trust among member countries has been continuously enhanced, pragmatic cooperation in economic, financial, trade, development and other fields has been continuously deepened, and communication and coordination in major international affairs have been continuously strengthened. Facts have proved that the BRICS countries, which account for 42.6% of the world’s population, have economic development, social stability, coordinated cooperation, and common growth, and conform to the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation, and win-win situation, which is conducive to a more balanced world economy and more effective global governance. International relations are more democratic. , Brazilian writer Paul Coelho said: ""The world is in the hands of those who have the courage to use their talents to realize their dreams."" At present, the international situation continues to undergo profound and complex changes, and the world economic recovery has gradually stabilized, but it still faces many Risk challenge. In this context, the Fortaleza meeting shoulders the mission of summarizing the history of cooperation and planning for future development, and is of great significance for the BRICS cooperation process. I look forward to this meeting to deepen cooperation, embody tolerance and convey confidence. To deepen cooperation is to strategically plan for the future development of the BRICS countries. Last year, during my meeting in Durban, I suggested that the BRICS countries should move toward the goal of ""integrated big market, multi-level big circulation, big land, sea and air connectivity, and big cultural exchanges."" This is my sincere expectation for the BRICS countries to develop closer economic partnership. It is hoped that all parties will take the opportunity to launch a new round of leaders' meeting as an opportunity to plan a new vision for cooperation, tap new driving forces for cooperation, make the BRICS cooperation mechanism more complete, policy coordination more mature, and pragmatic cooperation deeper, so that BRICS cooperation This strong foundation. To embody tolerance is to learn from and learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, expand opening up to the outside world, and pursue a win-win situation. The BRICS countries have different national conditions and different cultures, and have different views on some issues. This diversity and difference should not become resistance to cooperation, but should also be an important driving force for BRICS countries to complement each other's strengths and achieve inclusive cooperation. BRICS cooperation is not alone, but committed to common development with all countries in the world. During the meeting in Fortaleza, a dialogue meeting between leaders of the BRICS countries and South American countries will be held. It is hoped that the two sides will fully exchange views on international and regional issues of common interest, enhance understanding and promote cooperation, and at the same time discuss practical cooperation in the economic, trade and cultural fields. To pass on confidence, we must strengthen our confidence in the unity and mutual trust of the BRICS countries, our confidence in the development prospects of the BRICS countries, and our market and public confidence in the BRICS economies. The scenery should be eye-catching. The BRICS countries all need to promote economic structural reform and innovative development, and they all have the desire to maintain international fairness and justice and the common interests of emerging market countries and developing countries. As long as the BRICS countries increase political mutual trust, gather strategic consensus, make more voices, and put forward more plans, they can contribute more positive energy to promote world economic growth, improve global economic governance, and promote world peace and development. Brazil is an active participant in BRICS cooperation and has done a lot of fruitful work in preparing for the Fortaleza meeting. I believe that under the auspices of Pakistan, the Fortaleza meeting will surely write another brilliant chapter in the history of BRICS cooperation. , Q: How do you evaluate the level of comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Brazil? In what areas is China willing to cooperate with Pakistan? Will it continue to expand investment in Brazil? , A: Both China and I attach great importance to the development of China-Pakistan comprehensive strategic partnership. I am happy to see that with the joint efforts of both sides, China and Pakistan have reached an unprecedentedly high level of political and strategic mutual trust, and pragmatic cooperation has reached an unprecedented depth and breadth. , Last year, I held two bilateral meetings with President Rousseff on multilateral occasions.At some high level, pragmatic cooperation has reached unprecedented depth and breadth. , Last year, I held two bilateral meetings with President Rousseff on multilateral occasions and also talked on the phone. We exchanged in-depth views on China-Pakistan relations and issues of common concern, and reached important consensus on strengthening mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation in various fields. Last year, the bilateral trade volume between the two countries exceeded US$90 billion, China maintained Brazil's largest trading partner status, and Brazil became China's ninth largest trading partner. The mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of energy resources, manufacturing, finance and agriculture has achieved fruitful results. The pragmatic cooperation between China and Pakistan not only benefits the people of the two countries more and more, but also links the development of the two countries more and more closely. As important emerging market countries and developing countries, China and Pakistan have carried out fruitful strategic cooperation on major global issues and are committed to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction and safeguarding the common interests of developing countries. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. Confucius said: ""Forty without doubt"". I look forward to summing up the experience of the development of bilateral relations with the Brazilian leaders during my state visit to Brazil, discussing practical measures, close all-round exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, and enhancing the level of China-Pakistan relations. China is willing to work with Pakistan, insist on treating the other as an important cooperative partner, adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and win-win, and promote the sustained and stable growth of bilateral trade. At the same time, in accordance with the respective development plans of the two countries, we will actively carry out industrial investment cooperation and constantly explore new areas of cooperation. Better promote the economic and social development of China and Pakistan. , Q: How do you evaluate the level of strategic partnership between China and Argentina? In what key areas can the two countries cooperate in the future? A: Over the past 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Afghanistan, with the joint efforts of both sides, the relationship between the two countries has continued to develop rapidly. In the Argentine epic ""Martin Fiero"" there is a sentence: ""The way of brotherhood is unity and one heart."" China and Argentina have become good friends of mutual trust and good partners of equality and mutual benefit. , Last year, I held a bilateral meeting with President Christina at the St. Petersburg Summit of the Group of 20 leaders, and exchanged in-depth views on strengthening China-Arab exchanges and cooperation in various fields. The meeting left a deep impression on me. China appreciates Albania's adherence to the one-China principle and supports Albania's sovereignty claims on the island. In 2013, the bilateral trade volume reached US$14.8 billion, which was more than 2,400 times at the beginning of the establishment of diplomatic relations. China has become Argentina's second largest trading partner and main source of investment, and Argentina has become China's fifth largest trading partner in Latin America. The cooperation between the two sides in the fields of energy resources, agriculture, infrastructure construction, and finance has been fruitful and has brought tangible benefits to the people of both countries. The cultural exchanges between the two countries are rich and colorful, and the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples continue to deepen. In major international and regional affairs, China and Afghanistan have maintained close and good strategic cooperation, effectively safeguarding the common interests of developing countries. Both China and myself attach great importance to the China-Arab strategic partnership. I look forward to in-depth exchange of views with President Christina on China-Arab relations and issues of common concern, planning a blueprint for the development of bilateral relations, close exchanges and cooperation in various fields, promoting balanced and stable growth of bilateral trade, and enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation in industrial investment and infrastructure construction. Level, pushing China-Arab strategic partnership to a new level. , Q: How do you evaluate President Chavez's contribution to promoting Venezuela-China relations? What does China expect from the strategic partnership to strengthen cooperation with Venezuela under President Maduro and promote the common development of Venezuela? , Answer: President Chavez is a great friend of the Chinese people. During his lifetime, he attached great importance to developing relations with China, personally cared about and promoted practical cooperation between China and Venezuela, and devoted a lot of effort to establishing and developing a strategic partnership for common development of China and Venezuela. Important contribution. The Chinese people will always miss him. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Venezuela. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, especially since the two countries established a strategic partnership of common development in 2001, China-Venezuela relations have continued to develop rapidly and comprehensively. The high-level exchanges between the two countries are close, and mutual political trust is constantly deepening. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries in the fields of energy, finance, infrastructure construction, agriculture and high technology has achieved remarkable results. The bilateral trade volume between China and Venezuela increased from only 1.4 million US dollars at the beginning of diplomatic relations to 19.2 billion US dollars last year. China has become Venezuela's second largest trading partner, and Venezuela has become China's fourth largest trading partner, important energy partner, and project contracting market in Latin America. The people-to-people exchanges between the two countries are becoming closer and closer, which has consolidated the foundation of friendly public opinion between the two countries. President Maduro's successful state visit to China in September last year has effectively promoted the further development of China-Venezuela relations. Recently, the two sides jointly organized a series of colorful activities around the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, which has enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. At present, China-Venezuela relations are at an important stage of succession and succession. China attaches great importance to the development of China-Venezuela relations and is willing to cooperate with the Venezuela. At present, China-Venezuela relations are at an important stage of succession and succession. China attaches great importance to the development of China-Venezuela relations and is willing to work together with the Venezuelan side to take the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries as an opportunity to raise the level of bilateral relations, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, and promote greater development of bilateral relations under the new situation. I look forward to visiting Venezuela, in-depth discussion with President Maduro on all-round cooperation between the two countries, jointly planning a better future of bilateral relations, pushing China-Venezuela relations to a new level, and better benefiting the people of both countries. , Q: How do you view the mutually beneficial and cooperative relations between China and Cuba and their development prospects? , A: I once visited Cuba in June 2011 and had a frank and in-depth exchange with Chairman Raul. The warmth and friendship of the Cuban people left a deep impression on me. In 1960, Cuba took the lead in establishing diplomatic relations with New China in the Western Hemisphere, opening a new chapter in the development of China-Cuba relations and China-Latin America relations. For more than half a century, the friendly relations between China and Cuba have become increasingly mature, and the connotation of cooperation has been constantly enriched. The two countries go hand in hand on the path of building socialism with their own characteristics, support each other on issues involving each other's core interests, and cooperate closely in handling major international and regional issues. China-Cuba relations have withstood the test of international changes and have become a model of solidarity and cooperation among developing countries. , Cuban national hero Jose Marti said: ""Unity is the language of the world."" Middle Ages are good friends, good comrades, good brothers, and have the same ideals and beliefs. At present, both countries are in a crucial period of development, and they should seize the opportunity and seek common development. The two sides should close high-level exchanges, share experience in governing the country, speed up the promotion of cooperation in key areas such as agriculture, infrastructure construction, energy and mining, tourism, renewable energy, biotechnology, strengthen humanities and local exchanges, and close multilateral cooperation. It is believed that with the joint efforts of both sides, the high-level political relations between the two countries will be translated into fruitful results of pragmatic cooperation, and the mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation between China and Cuba will continue to reach a new level. , I look forward to summing up the experience of the development of bilateral relations with President Raul during my visit to Cuba and making plans for the future development of China-Cuba relations. , Q: How do you evaluate the current level of China-Latin America relations? What is your plan and vision for the development of the overall relationship between China and Latin America? , Answer: ""There is no distance between each other, and thousands of miles are still neighbors."" This ancient Chinese poem is a true portrayal of China's relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries. Both China and Latin America are developing countries at similar stages of development and shoulder the same development tasks. We support each other in taking a development path that suits their national conditions and are committed to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. These are the fundamental motives for us to seek common ground while reserving differences and work together. Since the new century, China and Latin America have firmly grasped the theme of common development, deepened mutual trust in politics, expanded cooperation in economy and trade, learned from each other in humanities, cooperated closely in international affairs, promoted the development of China-Latin America relations, and established South A model of South African cooperation. , Economic and trade pragmatic cooperation is an important pillar of China-Latin America relations. In recent years, the trade volume between China and Latin America has increased steadily, reaching a record US$261.6 billion in 2013. China has become the second largest trading partner and the third largest source of investment in Latin America. Mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of energy resources, infrastructure construction, finance, agriculture, manufacturing, high technology and other fields has achieved fruitful results and has effectively promoted the economic development and People's livelihood improved. At present, China-Latin America relations are facing important opportunities for further development, with better conditions and a stronger foundation. China has always viewed China-Latin America relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, and is willing to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to promote the development of a comprehensive and cooperative partnership based on equality, mutual benefit, and common development at a higher level, and to better benefit the people of China and Latin America. People of all countries. It is the common wish of China and Latin American and Caribbean countries to establish the China-Latin America Community Forum, to promote the overall cooperation between China and Latin America, and to follow the trend of regional and cross-regional cooperation. The second summit of the ECLAC held in Havana, Cuba in January this year adopted the ""Special Statement on Supporting the Establishment of the China-LAC Community Forum"", which laid an important foundation for advancing the overall cooperation between China and Latin America and raising the level of China-Latin America relations. Cuba has played an important role in this, and China highly appreciates it. At present, the conditions for establishing the China-Latin America Community Forum are ripe. China is willing to work with Latin America on the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and make good use of the China-Latin America Community Forum as an overall cooperation platform to carry out dialogue and cooperation in a wide range of fields to achieve mutual complementarity and common development. Both parties have common interests, promote South-South cooperation, and contribute actively to regional, world peace, stability, and development. , Q: The Bolivarian Revolution has always advocated defending and promoting the construction of a multi-polar world. How do you view the democratization of international relations? , A: At present, the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes. The multipolarization of the world is developing in depth. Multiple development centers are gradually taking shape in various regions of the world.The international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes. The world’s multi-polarization is developing in depth. Multiple development centers are gradually forming in various regions of the world. The overall strength of emerging market countries and developing countries is increasing. The international power balance is developing in the direction of maintaining world peace. . , ""A trip to the world is also a matter of justice."" Fairness and justice are the lofty goals pursued by people of all countries in the field of international relations. China resolutely safeguards international fairness and justice and is committed to promoting world multipolarization and democratization of international relations. We advocate that the destiny of the world must be controlled by the people of all countries, and that things in the world can only be handled by the governments and peoples of all countries in consultation. All countries in the world, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community and should jointly promote the democratization of international relations. The development of China-Venezuela relations is conducive to enhancing the overall strength of developing countries and promoting the democratization of international relations. Both sides should strengthen collaboration on the international stage and work with other developing countries to jointly safeguard the overall interests of developing countries. , Q: How can China further deepen reform? What does China's development mean for China's foreign policy? What role does China hope to play globally? , A: Although China has made great achievements in its development, China is still a large developing country with a population of more than 1.3 billion. It is still in and will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time. The Chinese people are striving to achieve modernization. This is a great cause unprecedented in human history and requires very hard work. , ""Difficulties and hardships make Yuru a success."" Over the past 30 years, more than 600 million Chinese have escaped poverty, contributing 70% to the cause of global poverty reduction. The proportion of China's economy in the world's total economy has increased from 1% to 12%. At present, China's economic growth has contributed nearly 30% to global economic growth. One of the most important experiences for China to achieve such tremendous development achievements is that we adhere to our national conditions, adhere to reform and opening up, and have embarked on a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Chinese have a strong sense of innovation since ancient times. ""Although Zhou is in an old state, his life will be restored."" ""Tianxingjian, the gentleman keeps on improving himself."" Facts have proved that without reform and opening up, there will be no China today; without reform and opening up, there will be no future for China. For more than 30 years, we have used reform to solve a series of major problems; in the future, we will continue to use reform to solve various difficulties and challenges along the way. Now, we have set the goal of ""two hundred years"", that is, by 2020, the GDP and the per capita income of urban and rural residents will double that of 2010, and a well-off society will be fully built; by the middle of this century, a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and harmonious society will be built. A modern socialist country realizes the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We are comprehensively deepening reforms, perfecting and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities. We will coordinate and advance the reform of the economic system, political system, cultural system, social system, ecological civilization system, and party building system. We will use the political courage and wisdom of ""knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, preferring to travel in the mountains"", and push forward the reform with the hard work of grasping the iron marks and leaving the mark on the stones, providing a powerful driving force for China's modernization construction and benefiting China more and better. People, bring new development opportunities to the world. As a developing country with the largest population, China's basic national conditions and positioning have not changed, and development remains our top priority. The purpose of China's foreign policy is to maintain world peace, promote common development, and create a favorable external environment for deepening domestic reforms and achieving the goal of ""two hundred years"". The Chinese people love peace, and there is no gene in the blood of the Chinese nation to invade others and dominate the world. China does not agree with the old logic of ""national power must be hegemony."" China adheres to the path of peaceful development, actively strives for a peaceful international environment to develop itself, and promotes world peace through its own development; not only allows China to make better use of the world’s opportunities, but also allows the world to better share China’s opportunities and promote China and other countries in the world.

在出席金砖国家领导人第六次会晤，对巴西、阿根廷、委内瑞拉、古巴进行国事访问并出席中国—拉美和加勒比国家领导人会晤前夕，国家主席习近平接受了巴西《经济价值报》、阿根廷《国民报》、委内瑞拉国家通讯社、古巴拉丁美洲通讯社的联合采访，就金砖国家合作、中国同四国双边关系、中拉关系、国际关系民主化、中国改革发展、中国外交政策及国际作用等阐述了看法和主张。全文如下：, 问：金砖国家合作已经走过5个年头，您如何评价金砖国家过去5年的合作，今后如何加强？您对这次金砖国家领导人福塔莱萨会晤有何期待？在发达国家经济发展放缓甚至停滞的情况下，金砖国家被寄予厚望，您认为金砖国家怎样才能克服内部差异性较大这一问题，成为全球经济发展的引擎？, 答：过去5年里，金砖国家形成了以领导人会晤为引领，多层次、宽领域的合作架构。各成员国政治互信不断增强，在经济、金融、贸易、发展等诸多领域务实合作不断深化，在重大国际事务中的沟通和协调不断加强。, 事实证明，占世界人口42.6%的金砖国家经济发展、社会稳定、协调合作、共同成长，顺应和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流，有利于世界经济更加平衡、全球治理更加有效、国际关系更加民主。, 巴西作家保罗·科埃略说：“世界掌握在那些有勇气凭借自己的才能去实现自己梦想的人手中。”当前，国际形势继续发生深刻复杂变化，世界经济复苏逐渐稳固，但仍面临诸多风险挑战。在这一背景下，福塔莱萨会晤肩负着总结合作历程、规划未来发展的使命，对金砖国家合作进程具有承前启后的重要意义。我期待这次会晤深化合作、体现包容、传递信心。, 深化合作，就是要从战略上谋划金砖国家未来发展。去年，我在德班会晤时建议，金砖国家要朝着“一体化大市场、多层次大流通、陆海空大联通、文化大交流”的目标迈进。这是我对金砖国家发展更紧密经济伙伴关系的真诚期待。希望各方以启动新一轮领导人会晤为契机，规划新的合作愿景，挖掘新的合作动力，使金砖国家合作机制更加完善、政策协调更加成熟、务实合作更加深入，让金砖国家合作本强基固。, 体现包容，就是要对内互学互鉴、取长补短，对外扩大开放、追求共赢。金砖国家国情不同、文化各异，对一些问题的看法不尽相同。这种多样性和差异性不应该成为合作的阻力，而应该也能够成为金砖国家优势互补、实现包容性合作的重要动力。金砖国家合作不是独善其身，而是致力于同世界各国共同发展。福塔莱萨会晤期间将举行金砖国家同南美国家领导人对话会。希望双方就共同关心的国际和地区问题充分交换意见，增进了解，推动合作，同时探讨经贸人文领域务实合作。, 传递信心，就是要坚定对金砖国家团结互信的信心，坚定对金砖国家发展前景的信心，坚定市场和公众对金砖国家经济的信心。风物长宜放眼量。金砖国家都有推进经济结构改革和创新发展的需要，都有维护国际公平正义、维护新兴市场国家和发展中国家共同利益的愿望。只要金砖国家增进政治互信，凝聚战略共识，发出更多声音，提出更多方案，就能够为推动世界经济增长、完善全球经济治理、促进世界和平与发展贡献更多正能量。, 巴西是金砖国家合作的积极参与者，在筹备福塔莱萨会晤方面做了大量卓有成效的工作。我相信，在巴方主持下，福塔莱萨会晤一定会书写金砖国家合作史上又一精彩篇章。, 问：您如何评价中国同巴西全面战略伙伴关系发展水平？中方愿意在哪些领域同巴方开展合作，是否将继续扩大在巴西投资？, 答：中国和我本人都高度重视发展中巴全面战略伙伴关系。我高兴地看到，在双方共同努力下，中巴政治和战略互信达到前所未有的高水平，务实合作达到前所未有的深度和广度。, 去年，我同罗塞夫总统两次在多边场合举行双边会见，还通了电话。我们就中巴关系和共同关心的问题深入交换意见，就加强双方各领域互利友好合作达成重要共识。, 去年，两国双边贸易额突破900亿美元，中国保持巴西第一大贸易伙伴地位，巴西成为中国第九大贸易伙伴。双方能源资源、制造业、金融、农业等领域互利合作成果丰硕。中巴务实合作不仅使两国人民得到越来越多的实惠，也将两国发展越来越紧密地联系在一起。, 作为重要的新兴市场国家和发展中国家，中巴双方在重大全球性议题上开展了卓有成效的战略协作，共同致力于推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展，维护发展中国家共同利益。, 今年是中巴建交40周年。孔子说：“四十而不惑”。我期待着在对巴西进行国事访问期间，同巴西领导人共同总结两国关系发展经验，探讨采取切实措施，密切两国全方位交流合作，提升中巴关系水平。中方愿意同巴方一道，坚持将对方视为重要合作伙伴，坚持互利共赢原则，推动双边贸易持续稳定增长，同时结合两国各自发展规划，积极开展产业投资合作，不断开拓新的合作领域，更好促进中巴两国经济社会发展。, 问：您如何评价中国同阿根廷战略伙伴关系发展水平？今后两国可以在哪些重点领域开展合作？, 答：中阿建交40多年来，在双方共同努力下，两国关系持续快速发展。阿根廷史诗《马丁·菲耶罗》中有这样一句话：“兄弟之道是团结同心。”中阿已经成为相互信任的好朋友、平等互利的好伙伴。, 去年，我同克里斯蒂娜总统在二十国集团领导人圣彼得堡峰会上举行双边会见，就加强中阿各领域交流合作深入交换意见。那次会见给我留下深刻印象。中方赞赏阿方坚持一个中国原则，支持阿方对马岛的主权要求。, 2013年，双边贸易额达148亿美元，是建交之初的2400多倍，中国已经成为阿根廷第二大贸易伙伴和主要投资来源国，阿根廷成为中国在拉美的第五大贸易伙伴。双方能源资源、农业、基础设施建设、金融等领域合作富有成效，给两国人民带来了实实在在的利益。两国人文交流丰富多彩，中阿人民相互了解和友谊不断加深。在重大国际和地区事务中，中阿保持密切而良好的战略协作，有力维护了发展中国家共同利益。, 中国和我本人都高度重视中阿战略伙伴关系。我期待着同克里斯蒂娜总统就中阿关系及共同关心的问题深入交换意见，规划双边关系发展蓝图，密切各领域交流合作，促进双边贸易均衡稳定增长，提升产业投资、基础设施建设等领域互利合作水平，推动中阿战略伙伴关系迈上新台阶。, 问：您如何评价查韦斯总统为推动委中关系作出的贡献？中方对同马杜罗总统领导下的委内瑞拉加强合作，推动委中共同发展的战略伙伴关系有何期待？, 答：查韦斯总统是中国人民的伟大朋友，他生前高度重视发展对华关系，亲自关心和推动中委务实合作，为建立和发展中委共同发展的战略伙伴关系倾注了大量心血，作出了重要贡献。中国人民永远怀念他。, 今年是中委建交40周年。建交以来，特别是2001年两国建立共同发展的战略伙伴关系以来，中委关系全面持续快速发展。两国高层往来密切，政治互信不断深化。两国能源、金融、基础设施建设、农业、高技术等领域务实合作成效显著。中委双边贸易额从建交初期的仅140万美元增至去年的192亿美元。中国已经成为委内瑞拉第二大贸易伙伴，委内瑞拉成为中国在拉美的第四大贸易伙伴、重要能源合作伙伴和工程承包市场。两国人文交流日益密切，夯实了两国友好的民意基础。马杜罗总统去年9月成功对中国进行国事访问，有力促进了中委关系进一步发展。近期双方围绕建交40周年，共同举办了一系列丰富多彩的活动，增进了两国人民相互了解和友谊。, 目前，中委关系正处在承前启后、继往开来的重要阶段。中方高度重视发展中委关系，愿意同委方携手合作，以两国建交40周年为契机，提高双边关系水平，加强各领域互利合作，推动两国关系在新形势下得到更大发展。我期待着访问委内瑞拉，同马杜罗总统深入探讨两国全方位合作，共同规划双边关系美好未来，推动中委关系迈上新台阶，更好造福两国人民。, 问：您如何看待中国同古巴互利友好合作关系及其发展前景？, 答：我曾经于2011年6月访问古巴，同劳尔主席进行坦诚深入的交流，古巴人民的热情友好给我留下深刻印象。, 1960年，古巴在西半球率先同新中国建交，揭开了中古关系、中拉关系发展新篇章。半个多世纪以来，中古友好关系日益成熟，合作内涵不断丰富。两国在建设本国特色社会主义道路上携手并进，在涉及彼此核心利益问题上相互支持，在处理重大国际和地区问题上密切配合。中古关系经受住了国际风云变幻的考验，已经成为发展中国家团结合作的典范。, 古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂说：“团结是全世界的语言。”中古是好朋友、好同志、好兄弟，有相同的理想和信念。当前，两国都处于发展的关键时期，应该抓住机遇，共谋发展。双方要密切高层往来，分享治国理政经验，加快推进农业、基础设施建设、能矿、旅游、可再生能源、生物技术等重点领域合作，加强人文和地方交流，密切多边协作。相信在双方一道努力下，两国高水平的政治关系将转化为丰硕的务实合作成果，中古互利友好合作将不断迈上新台阶。, 我期待着访问古巴期间同劳尔主席共同总结两国关系发展经验，对中古关系未来发展作出规划。, 问：您如何评价当前中国同拉美关系水平？您对中拉整体关系发展有怎样的规划和设想？, 答：“相知无远近，万里尚为邻。”这句中国古诗是中国同拉美和加勒比国家关系的真实写照。中拉都是发展中国家，处在相似的发展阶段，肩负着相同的发展任务。我们支持对方走符合本国国情的发展道路，致力于推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。这些是我们能够求同存异、携手共进的根本动因。, 新世纪以来，中拉双方牢牢把握共同发展的主题，政治上深化互信，经贸上扩大合作，人文上互学互鉴，在国际事务中密切配合，推动中拉关系实现长足发展，树立了南南合作的典范。, 经贸务实合作是中拉关系的重要支柱。近年来，中拉贸易额节节攀升，2013年达到创纪录的2616亿美元。中国已经成为拉美第二大贸易伙伴国和第三大投资来源国，双方能源资源、基础设施建设、金融、农业、制造业、高技术等领域互利合作硕果累累，有力促进了各自国家经济发展和民生改善。, 当前，中拉关系进一步发展面临重要机遇，拥有更好条件和更坚实基础。中国始终从战略高度和长远角度看待中拉关系，愿意同拉美和加勒比国家一道努力，推动平等互利、共同发展的中拉全面合作伙伴关系在更高水平向前发展，更好造福中拉双方人民和各国人民。, 建立中国—拉共体论坛，推动中拉整体合作，顺应区域和跨区域合作潮流，是中国同拉美和加勒比国家的共同愿望。, 今年1月在古巴哈瓦那举行的拉共体第二届峰会通过《关于支持建立中国—拉共体论坛的特别声明》，为推进中拉整体合作、提高中拉关系水平奠定了重要基础。古巴为此发挥了重要作用，中方对此高度赞赏。, 目前，建立中国—拉共体论坛的条件已经成熟。中方愿意同拉方一道，本着相互尊重、平等互利的原则，用好中国—拉共体论坛这一整体合作平台，开展广泛领域的对话和合作，实现优势互补和共同发展，为维护中拉双方共同利益，推动南南合作，促进地区和世界和平、稳定、发展作出积极贡献。, 问：玻利瓦尔革命始终倡导捍卫和推动建设多极化世界，您如何看待国际关系民主化？, 答：当前，国际形势正在发生深刻复杂变化，世界多极化深入发展，多个发展中心在世界各地区逐渐形成，新兴市场国家和发展中国家整体实力增强，国际力量对比朝着有利于维护世界和平方向发展。, “大道之行也，天下为公。”公平正义是世界各国人民在国际关系领域追求的崇高目标。中国坚决维护国际公平正义，致力于推动世界多极化、国际关系民主化。我们主张世界的命运必须由各国人民共同掌握，世界上的事情只能由各国政府和人民共同商量来办。世界各国不分大小、强弱、贫富，都是国际社会的平等成员，应该共同推动国际关系民主化。, 中委关系发展有利于增强发展中国家整体实力、促进国际关系民主化。双方应该在国际舞台上加强协作，并同其他发展中国家一道，共同维护发展中国家整体利益。, 问：中国如何进一步深化改革？中国发展对中国外交政策意味着什么？中国希望在全球扮演何种角色？, 答：中国发展虽然取得了巨大成就，但中国仍然是一个拥有13亿多人口的发展中大国，仍然处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段。中国人民正在努力实现现代化，这是人类历史上前无古人的伟大事业，需要付出十分艰苦的努力。, “艰难困苦，玉汝于成。”在过去30多年间，有6亿多中国人摆脱了贫困，对全球减贫事业贡献率达70%。中国经济占世界经济总量的比重从1%提高到12%，目前中国经济增长对全球经济增长贡献率将近30%。中国取得如此巨大的发展成就，最重要的一条经验就是我们坚持立足本国国情，坚持改革开放，走出了一条中国特色社会主义道路。, 中国人自古就具有强烈的创新意识。“周虽旧邦，其命维新。”“天行健，君子以自强不息。”事实证明，没有改革开放，就没有中国的今天；没有改革开放，也不会有中国的未来。30多年来，我们用改革的办法解决了一系列重大问题；今后，我们还将坚持用改革的办法来破解前进道路上的各种困难和挑战。现在，我们确定了“两个一百年”奋斗目标，即到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。我们正在全面深化改革，完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化。我们将协调推进经济体制、政治体制、文化体制、社会体制、生态文明体制和党的建设制度改革。我们将以“明知山有虎，偏向虎山行”的政治勇气和智慧，以抓铁有痕、踏石留印的实干劲头推进改革，为中国现代化建设提供强大推动力量，更多更好造福中国人民，为世界带来新的发展机遇。, 中国作为人口最多的发展中国家的基本国情和定位没有改变，发展仍然是我们的第一要务。中国外交政策的宗旨就是维护世界和平、促进共同发展，为国内深化改革、实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标营造良好外部环境。中国人民爱好和平，中华民族的血液中没有侵略他人、称霸世界的基因，中国不认同“国强必霸”的陈旧逻辑。中国坚持走和平发展道路，既积极争取和平的国际环境发展自己，又以自身发展促进世界和平；既让中国更好利用世界的机遇，又让世界更好分享中国的机遇，促进中国和世界各国良性互动、互利共赢。, 随着中国发展，中国将更好发挥负责任大国作用。我们将更加积极有为地维护世界和平，倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，致力于通过协商谈判和平解决争端。我们坚定维护以联合国为中心的战后国际秩序，积极参与联合国维和行动和地区安全对话合作。, 我们将更加积极有为地参与国际事务，致力于推动完善国际治理体系，积极推动扩大发展中国家在国际事务中的代表性和发言权。我们将更多提出中国方案、贡献中国智慧，为国际社会提供更多公共产品。, 我们将更加积极有为地促进共同发展，坚持正确义利观，义利并举、以义为先，促进南北对话和南南合作，特别是帮助发展中国家实现自主和可持续发展。(新华社北京7月14日电), 《 人民日报 》（ 2014年07月15日 01
