1,10,"[, Colleagues: First of all, I would like to congratulate President Erdogan. This Antalya summit has been a complete success and has released a positive signal to the G20 for the impetus of the world economy and the well-being of peoples of all countries. , China will hold the eleventh summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province from September 4th to 5th next year. I take this opportunity to thank all countries and international organizations for their support to China. I look forward to your colleagues attending the Hangzhou Summit. , There is a saying in China, there is paradise on the top, Suhang on the bottom. It means that Hangzhou and Suzhou are picturesque and can be called paradise on earth. Hangzhou is a historical and cultural city and a city of innovation and vitality. It is believed that the 2016 summit will present a unique charm of history and reality. During the previous communication with all parties, China deeply felt everyone's expectations for next year's summit. Based on the current situation and the expectations of all parties, China has determined the theme of the 2016 summit as ""building a world economy of innovation, vitality, linkage and inclusiveness"", and hopes to advance the preparations for the summit next year from four key areas. One is to innovate the growth mode, focusing on promoting reform and innovation, opening up and seizing new opportunities, and enhancing the growth potential of the world economy. The second is to improve global economic and financial governance, enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries, and improve the ability of the world economy to resist risks. The third is to promote international trade and investment, give play to its role in promoting growth, and build an open world economy. The fourth is to promote inclusive and linked development, strive to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda, eradicate poverty, and achieve common development. , We propose the above theme and focus, mainly for three considerations. (1) The world economy is basically out of the crisis, but the recovery is highly fragile, the growth momentum is insufficient, and the trends and policies of the major economies have become more differentiated. We urgently need to find new sources of growth and push the world economy to a new round of prosperity. (2) In recent years, global economic governance reforms have been slow, and international economic and trade rules have accelerated. This year’s UN Development Summit, the 10th World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, and the Paris Conference on Climate Change have been held successively to make new plans for international development cooperation, the multilateral trading system, and global action to address climate change. We need to take coordinated action to lead the development direction of international economic cooperation. (3) The G20 is facing a shift from crisis response to a long-term governance mechanism, with issues extending from short-term issues to deep-level and long-term issues. The necessity and difficulty of coordinating macroeconomic policies and strengthening cooperation among G20 members have increased simultaneously. We need to carry forward the spirit of partnership, promote the smooth transition of the G20 and consolidate its position as the main platform for global economic governance. , Colleagues! , The G20 is the G20 of each member. During the preparation of the Hangzhou Summit, China will always maintain an open, transparent and inclusive attitude, strengthen communication and coordination with all members, and jointly maintain, build and develop the G20. , In September next year, I will welcome you by the West Lake. , thank you all! , (Xinhua News Agency, Antalya, Turkey, November 16th), ""People's Daily"" (November 17, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's Statement on China's Hosting of the 2016 Summit at the Working Luncheon of the G20 Leaders Summit,1019,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-11-17,"[, 各位同事：, 首先，我要祝贺埃尔多安总统，这次安塔利亚峰会取得圆满成功，对外释放了二十国集团为世界经济谋动力、为各国人民谋福祉的积极信号。, 中国将于明年9月4日至5日在浙江省杭州市举行二十国集团领导人第十一次峰会。借此机会，我要感谢各国和国际组织对中方的支持。期待各位同事届时出席杭州峰会。, 中国有句俗语，上有天堂，下有苏杭。意思是说，杭州和苏州风景如画，堪称人间天堂。杭州是历史文化名城，也是创新活力之城，相信2016年峰会将给大家呈现一种历史和现实交汇的独特韵味。, 在前期同各方沟通中，中方深深感受到大家对明年峰会的期待。基于当前形势和各方期待，中方把2016年峰会的主题确定为“构建创新、活力、联动、包容的世界经济”，希望从4个重点领域推进明年峰会筹备工作。一是创新增长方式，重在推进改革创新，开辟和抓住新机遇，提升世界经济增长潜力。二是完善全球经济金融治理，增强新兴市场国家和发展中国家的代表性和发言权，提高世界经济抗风险能力。三是促进国际贸易和投资，发挥其对增长的推动作用，构建开放型世界经济。四是推动包容、联动式发展，力求落实2030年可持续发展议程，消除贫困，实现共同发展。, 我们提出上述主题和重点，主要出于3方面考虑。, （一）世界经济基本走出危机，但复苏高度脆弱，增长动力不足，主要经济体走势和政策更趋分化。我们迫切需要找到新的增长源，推动世界经济走向新一轮繁荣。, （二）近年来，全球经济治理改革进展不畅，国际经济贸易规则加速演变。今年联合国发展峰会、世界贸易组织第十届部长会、气候变化巴黎大会相继举行，对国际发展合作、多边贸易体制、应对气候变化全球行动作出新的规划。我们需要采取协调一致行动，引领国际经济合作发展方向。, （三）二十国集团面临从危机应对向长效治理机制的转变，议题从短期问题向深层次和长期性问题延伸。二十国集团成员协调宏观经济政策和加强合作的必要性和难度同步增加。我们需要发扬伙伴关系精神，促使二十国集团顺利完成转变，巩固作为全球经济治理主要平台的地位。, 各位同事！, 二十国集团是每个成员的二十国集团。在杭州峰会筹备过程中，中方将始终保持开放、透明、包容姿态，同各成员加强沟通和协调，共同把二十国集团维护好、建设好、发展好。, 明年9月，我将在西湖之畔欢迎各位。, 谢谢大家！, （新华社土耳其安塔利亚11月16日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年11月17日 02 版）, ]",习近平在二十国集团领导人峰会工作午宴上关于中国主办2016年峰会的发言,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27822554

6,66,"[, Dear President Zuma, Dear President Mugabe, Chairman of the African Union, Dear Heads of State and Government, Dear Ms. Zuma, Chairman of the African Union Commission, Dear Colleagues, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and gentlemen, friends: I am very happy to meet you in beautiful Johannesburg. The theme of the China-Africa Entrepreneurs Conference is ""win-win cooperation and common development-to promote the process of integration and industrialization in Africa"", which has practical significance for the inclusive and sustainable development of Africa. Here, I would like to express my warm congratulations on the success of the conference! My heartfelt thanks to friends from all walks of life who have contributed to China-Africa economic and trade cooperation for a long time! Although China and Africa are thousands of miles apart, China-Africa exchanges have a long history and the friendship between China and Africa has lasted for a long time. Today's Africa is full of vitality, and China-Africa economic and trade cooperation has reached an unprecedented level. Many Chinese entrepreneurs have gone to Africa to invest and operate, and more and more African friends have gone to China to do business. In Zhejiang Province, where I used to work, there is a small city called Yiwu, known as the ""commodity capital"" in the world. There are now thousands of African businessmen stationed there to engage in China-Africa trade. As of the end of 2014, China's stock of various investments in Africa reached US$101 billion, and more than 3,100 enterprises were established in Africa. In 2014, China-Africa trade volume reached US$221.9 billion. China has become a major partner in Africa in areas such as trade, investment, infrastructure construction, and economic and trade cooperation parks. At present, the world economic situation is complex and changeable, the economic recovery of developed countries is weak, the economic growth of emerging market countries is slowing down, and the risk of uncertainty and uncertainty of global economic growth is increasing. However, as the continent with the most developing countries, Africa has become a bright spot in the global economy in recent years. At present, the security situation in Africa is generally stable. Governments of all countries have taken economic development as their core task and formulated ambitious economic, industrial and infrastructure development plans. The average annual economic growth rate of the African continent is close to 5%. Africa’s ascending industrialization and urbanization process has injected new impetus into global economic growth, making Africa the fastest growing and most promising continent. Throughout the history of modern world economic development, the experience of China and many countries has proved that industrialization is the only way for a country’s economic development. China's industrialization process of one and a half centuries is full of hardships and twists and turns. As early as the middle of the 19th century, China was forced to open its doors under the impact of powerful ships and artillery and began the early industrialization known as the ""Western Movement"". After the reform and opening up, China entered a fast road to industrialization. In just a few decades, China has gone through hundreds of years in developed countries, built an industrial system with a complete system and huge production capacity, and has become the world’s largest manufacturing country and the world’s second largest economy. It has successfully explored An industrial road that fits China's national conditions. , Looking back on the history of China's industrialization, we deeply realize that industrialization can't work in closed doors. Industrialization in the era of economic globalization needs to make good use of both domestic and foreign markets and resources, and make full use of its own comparative advantages to achieve global resource allocation. It is necessary to fully learn from and absorb the experience of advanced countries, and choose an industrialization path suitable for one's own characteristics according to the national conditions of the country. As the region with the greatest development potential in the world, Africa can fully exert its advantages and make great achievements. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Industrialization is the prerequisite for inclusive and sustainable development in Africa, and is the key to creating jobs, eradicating poverty and improving living standards. The road to industrialization in Africa requires African people to practice and explore. China sincerely hopes to share Chinese experience with African countries, and is willing to provide financial, technical and talent support for Africa's industrialization process. In the fields of industry, infrastructure construction, investment, and trade facilitation, China-Africa cooperation will provide more opportunities for investment and trade between the two companies, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of African industries and making up for the infrastructure gap in Africa. In modern agriculture, green development, Cooperation in poverty reduction and benefiting the people will promote the sharing of advanced technologies and the establishment of sustainable development models by Chinese and African companies, enhance their capacity for independent development, improve the level of public governance, and improve the lives of African people. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The new situation brings new opportunities. China and Africa should inherit the glorious tradition of sincerity and friendship and carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. To strengthen China-Africa friendly cooperation, I make the following suggestions. , First, adhere to equal cooperation based on mutual benefit and win-win results. Both China and Africa should adhere to the principle of giving equal attention to justice and benefit, proceed from the reality of China-Africa development, consider each other's concerns, seek and expand the intersection of interests, and jointly build a community of shared destiny between China and Africa. Second, insist on open and inclusive multi-party cooperation. The world today has developed into a close connectionAnd expand the intersection of interests and jointly build a community of shared destiny between China and Africa. Second, insist on open and inclusive multi-party cooperation. The world today has developed into a closely linked whole. We stand for openness and tolerance of the global economy and resolutely oppose trade and investment protectionism. China-Africa economic and trade cooperation is open cooperation. Enterprises of other countries are welcome to join in China-Africa cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. , Third, adhere to the ability-oriented pragmatic cooperation. China is willing to share advanced and applicable technologies with Africa without reservation, and is willing to combine China's advantageous industries with the development needs of Africa, deepen industrial cooperation, promote the improvement of the quality of African labor, create jobs, and enhance the endogenous power of African economic development. We will effectively help Africa to solve the problems of industrialized talent demand and capacity building by dispatching experts, establishing vocational training centers, and strengthening Sino-African talent training and entrepreneur exchanges. , Fourth, adhere to green and low-carbon sustainable development. Africa has rich natural resources and a superior ecological environment, and China-Africa cooperation should put sustainable development first. We will implement climate change and ecological protection projects for African countries, train professionals in the field of ecological protection for African countries, and help Africa take a green and low-carbon sustainable development path. , Fifth, adhere to the priority of priority cooperation. We will carry out overall planning and design of China-Africa comprehensive economic and trade cooperation, support the construction of farmland and water conservancy in African countries, strengthen transportation infrastructure and power security, and strongly support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the construction of poverty reduction and benefit projects, so that China-Africa cooperation will benefit the people. Benefit all people. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Entrepreneurs are the main body of China-Africa economic and trade cooperation and the messenger of promoting China-Africa friendship. I sincerely hope that the vast number of Chinese and African entrepreneurs will shoulder the burden of all-round economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa, be brave in innovation, learn from each other, and work together to create a better future for the people of China and Africa! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, December 4th), ""People's Daily"" (December 05, 2015, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: work together to write a new chapter of China-Africa cooperation,2136,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-12-05,"[, 尊敬的祖马总统，, 尊敬的非洲联盟轮值主席穆加贝总统，, 尊敬的各国元首、政府首脑，, 尊敬的非盟委员会主席祖马女士，, 尊敬的各位同事，各位嘉宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　有机会在美丽的约翰内斯堡同大家见面，我感到十分高兴。这次中非企业家大会以“合作共赢，共同发展——助推非洲一体化和工业化进程”为主题，对非洲的包容性和可持续发展具有现实意义。在此，我谨对大会的成功召开，表示热烈的祝贺！对长期以来在中非经贸合作中作出贡献的各界朋友，表示衷心的感谢！, 　　中国和非洲虽然远隔万里，但中非交往源远流长，中非友谊历久弥坚。今天的非洲充满了生机活力，中非经贸合作达到了前所未有的高度。众多中国企业家到非洲开展投资经营，越来越多的非洲朋友去中国经商工作。在我曾经工作过的浙江省，有个小城叫义乌，号称世界“小商品之都”，现在有几千名非洲商人常驻那里，从事中非贸易。, 　　截至2014年底，中国对非洲各类投资存量达1010亿美元，在非洲建立企业3100多家；2014年，中非贸易额达到2219亿美元。中国在贸易、投资、基础设施建设、经贸合作园区等领域已经成为非洲主要合作伙伴。, 　　当前，世界经济形势复杂多变，发达国家经济复苏乏力，新兴市场国家经济增长放缓，全球经济增长不稳定不确定性风险加大。然而，非洲作为发展中国家最多的大陆，近年来成为全球经济的一个亮点。, 　　目前，非洲安全局势总体稳定，各国政府均将发展经济作为核心任务，制定了雄心勃勃的经济、产业、基础设施发展规划，非洲大陆年均经济增速接近5%。非洲方兴未艾的工业化和城市化进程为全球经济增长注入了新动力，使非洲成为增长最快和最有希望的大陆。, 　　纵观近代世界经济发展史，中国和许多国家的经验证明，工业化是一个国家经济发展的必由之路。中国一个半世纪的工业化历程充满艰辛和曲折。早在19世纪中叶，中国在列强坚船利炮撞击之下，被迫打开国门，开始了被称为“洋务运动”的早期工业化。改革开放以后，中国驶入工业化的快速路。中国用了短短几十年时间，走过了发达国家几百年的历程，建成了体系完整、产能巨大的工业体系，成为世界制造业第一大国和全球第二大经济体，成功探索出一条符合中国国情的工业化道路。, 　　回顾中国工业化历程，我们深刻认识到，搞好工业化，闭门造车不行，经济全球化时代的工业化需要利用好国内国外两个市场、两种资源，发挥好自身比较优势，实现资源全球配置。要充分借鉴和吸收先进国家的经验，根据本国国情选择适合自身特点的工业化道路。非洲作为全球发展潜力最大的地区，完全可以发挥优势，大有作为。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　工业化是非洲实现包容性和可持续发展的前提，是创造就业、消除贫困、提高生活水平的关键。非洲工业化之路，需要非洲人民去实践、去探索。中国真诚希望同非洲国家分享中国经验，愿为非洲工业化进程提供资金、技术、人才支持。在工业、基础设施建设、投资和贸易便利化等领域，中非合作将为双方企业投资和贸易提供更多机会，从而提高非洲产业竞争力，弥补非洲基础设施缺口；在现代农业、绿色发展、减贫惠民等方面的合作，将促进中非企业分享先进技术和建立可持续发展模式，增强自主发展能力，提高公共治理水平，改善非洲人民生活。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　新形势带来新机遇，中非应该继承真诚友好的光荣传统，把互助合作精神发扬光大。为加强中非友好合作，我提出以下建议。, 　　第一，坚持互利共赢的平等合作。中非双方应该坚持义利并举原则，从中非发展实际出发，相互考虑对方关切，寻找和扩大利益交集，共同打造中非命运共同体。, 　　第二，坚持开放包容的多方合作。当今世界已经发展成为密切联系的整体。我们主张全球经济开放包容，坚决反对贸易和投资保护主义。中非经贸合作是开放的合作，欢迎其他国家的企业在互利共赢基础上，加入到中非合作中来。, 　　第三，坚持能力导向的务实合作。中方愿意毫无保留地同非方分享先进适用技术，愿意将中国优势产业同非洲发展需要相结合，深化产业合作，促进非洲劳动力素质提高，创造就业，增强非洲经济发展内生动力。我们将通过派遣专家、建立职业培训中心、加强中非人才培训和企业家交流，切实帮助非洲解决工业化人才需求和能力建设问题。, 　　第四，坚持绿色低碳可持续发展。非洲拥有丰富的自然资源和优越的生态环境，中非合作要把可持续发展放在第一位。我们将为非洲国家实施应对气候变化及生态保护项目，为非洲国家培训生态保护领域专业人才，帮助非洲走绿色低碳可持续发展道路。, 　　第五，坚持基础优先的重点合作。我们将对中非全方位经贸合作进行整体规划设计，支持非洲国家农田水利建设，强化交通基础设施和动力保障，大力支持中小企业发展和减贫惠民项目建设，让中非合作造福于民，惠及全民。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　企业家是中非经贸合作的主体，是推动中非友谊的使者。我衷心希望广大中非企业家担负起中非经贸全方位合作的重担，勇于创新，互相借鉴，共同为创造中非人民的美好未来而努力！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社约翰内斯堡12月4日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2015年12月05日 03 版）, ]",习近平：携手共进，谱写中非合作新篇章,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27892687
7,67,"[, On December 1, on the eve of his state visit to South Africa, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Making the Rainbow of Friendship and Cooperation More Dazzling"" in the South African Star. The article is as follows: To make the rainbow of friendship and cooperation even more dazzling, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, ""Rainbow Country"" South Africa, is a dazzling pearl inlaid on the southernmost tip of the African continent. This is a magical land with beautiful scenery, rich resources, hardworking people and diverse cultures. On this land, Mandela was born, deducing the legend of racial reconciliation that turned Gange into a jade silk. The triumphant and glorious history of the national liberation struggle here gives South Africa a unique and profound charm that attracts the world's attention. With the friendly feelings towards my close brothers, I will once again set foot on this beautiful land, pay a state visit to South Africa, and chair the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with President Zuma. , ""Aspirants, don't take mountains and seas as far away as possible."" Although China and South Africa are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the friendship between the peoples of the two countries has lasted forever. As early as the anti-apartheid struggle of the South African people, the Chinese people firmly supported the just cause of the South African people for equality, freedom and liberation, and they shared their deep friendship with the South African people in the same breath, common destiny and heart. In 1998, China officially established diplomatic relations with New South Africa, which opened a new era of China-South Africa relations. Over the past 17 years, China-South Africa relations have developed in an all-round way, achieving a three-step jump from partnership to strategic partnership to comprehensive strategic partnership, completing the historic leap in the development of bilateral relations and becoming the most dynamic and One of the important bilateral relations. Over the past 17 years, China-South Africa friendly cooperation has grown from a small boat to a giant ship, and has continued to ride the wind and waves along the direction of mutual benefit, win-win and common development. At present, China-South Africa relations have entered the best period in history, from an unprecedented degree of political mutual trust and increasingly close international cooperation, to fruitful and pragmatic cooperation, and rich and colorful cultural and cultural exchanges, all reflecting the strategic height of China-South Africa relations. , In 2013, I came to South Africa after my first visit as the Chinese President. In the past three years, President Zuma and I have exchanged visits, held many meetings on multilateral occasions, reached a series of important consensuses on the development of China-South Africa relations under the new situation, and determined bilateral relations as the strategic fulcrum and priority of their respective foreign policies, and jointly formulated The ""China-South Africa 5-10 Years Cooperation Strategic Plan"" has injected strong momentum into the development of China-South Africa comprehensive strategic partnership. , China-South Africa relations have gone beyond the bilateral scope and become increasingly of strategic significance and global influence. Both China and South Africa are major developing countries and emerging market countries. They adhere to the same or similar outlooks on development, security, and international order. They have broad consensus on major international affairs and hot issues. The two sides are in the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS countries. , International organizations such as the “four basic nations” of climate change, and multilateral mechanisms have coordinated and cooperated closely and carried out fruitful cooperation. The integration of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has deepened. In 2014, the bilateral trade volume between China and South Africa was US$60.3 billion, a nearly 40-fold increase over the establishment of diplomatic relations. China has been South Africa’s largest trading partner for six consecutive years. China's investment in South Africa has grown from scratch and has reached US$13 billion so far. South Africa has become the country with the most Chinese investment in Africa. The home appliance industrial park, automobile, locomotive assembly plant, cement plant and other projects invested and constructed by Chinese companies in South Africa have created tens of thousands of local jobs. Hisense TVs and refrigerators have entered thousands of households in South Africa as major home appliance brands. South African companies in China The Snow Beer produced by the joint venture has also become a favorite beverage of the Chinese people. The people of the two countries have built a rainbow bridge of friendship. South Africa is an African country that has established friendly provinces and cities with China, has Confucius Institutes and classrooms, and accepts the most Chinese students. Last year and this year, China and South Africa successfully held national annual events in each other’s country, showing wonderful arts and culture and development achievements to the people of the other country, which caused strong reactions. This is the first time between China and African countries, which has created China-Africa humanities. A new chapter in communication. In the friendly relations between China and all other countries, 17 years is not long. However, with the personal promotion of China and South Africa and the sincere efforts of both sides, China-South Africa relations have developed over the past 17 years and have become a model of unity and cooperation between China and Africa and even with major developing countries. , ""Being desperate for a thousand miles, to a higher level."" China-South Africa relations have stood at a new historical starting point, and the two sides have a strong willingness to strengthen cooperation. We are willing to work with the South to seize opportunities and take advantage of the momentum to push China-South Africa comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level and better benefit both peoples. -China and South Africa will be strategic partners facing the future with a high degree of mutual trust. Both sides must always be strategic and long-termStepping up to a new level to better benefit the two peoples. -China and South Africa will be strategic partners facing the future with a high degree of mutual trust.

More fruitful results bring more tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. -China and South Africa should be friendly partners who know each other and exchange ideas. Friendship starts with knowing and understanding. China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the South in the areas of tourism, culture, education, youth, women, think tanks, media and other fields.

Active promoter. This year is a year of special significance in the development of China-South Africa relations and China-Africa relations. Another important agenda for my visit to South Africa this time is to host the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with President Zuma. This year coincides with the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum. Over the past 15 years, the China-Africa Cooperation Forum has become an important platform for China-Africa collective dialogue and an effective mechanism for promoting pragmatic cooperation. It has effectively promoted the common development of China and Africa and brought tangible benefits to the people of China and Africa. China is the largest developing country, Africa is the continent with the largest concentration of developing countries, China and Africa have always been a community of shared destiny. At present, African countries generally look forward to accelerating the process of industrialization and agricultural modernization, and are committed to achieving economic independence and independent and sustainable development. China is comprehensively deepening reforms and advancing economic restructuring, and has more mutual benefits with African countries on the basis of complementary advantages. Conditions for winning development. China-Africa development strategy is highly compatible, and China-Africa cooperation development has ushered in unprecedented historic opportunities. The China-Africa Cooperation Forum Johannesburg Summit is about to kick off. This is the second summit held in the 15 years since the Forum was established and the first China-Africa summit to be held on the African continent. The leaders of China and Africa gathered together to discuss friendship and seek cooperation. They will comprehensively plan China-Africa friendly and pragmatic cooperation in various fields in the next three years, promote the comprehensive development of China-Africa cooperation, and raise China-Africa relations to a new height. This forum summit is a milestone in the development of China-Africa relations. It will send a strong signal to the world that China and Africa go hand in hand, win-win cooperation and common development, so that the people of China and Africa and the world can see new prospects for development. At present, the international situation continues to undergo profound and complex changes, the overall strength of developing countries continues to rise, and the world will increasingly pay attention to the vibrant continent of Africa. We believe that the upcoming China-Africa Summit will promote South-South cooperation, drive North-South dialogue, and promote the development of the international governance system in a more just and reasonable direction.

8,68,"[, On November 30, on the eve of a state visit to Zimbabwe, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Let China and Tianjin Friendship Bloom a More Brilliant Bloom"" in the Herald of Zimbabwe. The article is as follows: Let China-Tsinjin Friendship Bloom More Brilliantly, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, I will pay a state visit to Zimbabwe from December 1st to 2nd. This is my first visit to Zimbabwe, and I am looking forward to this trip. , Although I have not yet embarked on the land of Zimbabwe, I am no stranger to this beautiful country and the people here. Here has a long history, splendid civilization, beautiful scenery, rich products, and more industrious, intelligent, brave and strong people. The people of Zimbabwe have always cherished national independence and defended national dignity, and are committed to the joint self-improvement of the African continent. Just like the stone sculpture ""Zimbabwe Bird"" in the Great Zimbabwe ruins, it has never changed its character after years and wind and rain. The headwind is exactly the motivating force for birds to fly and fly higher. Although China and Zimbabwe are thousands of miles away, the traditional friendship that connects the two peoples is deep and strong. During the struggle for national liberation in Zimbabwe, the two peoples fought side by side and forged an unforgettable friendship. I heard that many Zimbabwean freedom fighters who had been trained by the Chinese in China and in Nachingwe camp in Tanzania still hummed songs such as ""Three Disciplines and Eight Attentions"", which made me very moved. On April 18, 1980, the day Zimbabwe became independent, China and Zimbabwe established diplomatic relations. Over the past 35 years, the Chinese people and the Zimbabwean people have been in the same boat, their friendship has lasted forever, and their cooperation has been fruitful. Last August, President Mugabe successfully paid a state visit to China. Both China and Tianjin agreed to make the two countries a good partner, good friend and good brother who treat each other on an equal footing, support each other, benefit each other and achieve common development. This consensus is of great significance for leading the development of China-Tianjin relations. At present, China is the fourth largest trading partner and the largest source of investment in Zimbabwe. Projects such as the expansion of the Victoria Falls Airport, the expansion of the Kariba South Bank Hydropower Station, and the ""Mobile One Network"" telecommunications transformation and other projects financed and undertaken by China will provide important assistance for Zimbabwe to improve its infrastructure. China-Tianjin friendship has also taken root in the hearts of the two peoples. As far as I know, there is a mother group called ""Love of Africa"" ​​among the overseas Chinese living in Zimbabwe, and there is a ""Father Cheng"" known to local children even with the license plate number. They have been sending care and warmth to the local orphans for many years. They have written the ""present tense"" of Sino-Tianjin friendship with practical actions, and also cultivated the ""future tense"" of Sino-Tianjin friendship. , Last year, President Mugabe presented a pair of lion cubs to the Chinese people on behalf of the people of Zimbabwe during his visit to China and has now officially settled in the Shanghai Wildlife Park. They are named ""jinjin"" and ""fifi"". In Chinese, it is homophonic with ""Zimbabwe"" and ""Africa"", which implies friendship between China and Zimbabwe. They have become messengers of Sino-Tianjin friendship and are loved by the Chinese people, especially children. The extraordinary development of Sino-Tianjin relations shows that Sino-Tianjin friendship stems from the cultural traditions of sincerity, friendship and loyalty between the two countries, from the basic principles of foreign relations that the two countries jointly follow, such as independence and mutual respect, and from the economic development of the two countries. 1. The common mission to improve people's livelihood. Although the international situation continues to undergo profound and complex changes, consolidating relations with a large number of African countries, including Zimbabwe, has always been the cornerstone of China’s diplomacy and will never change. China will continue to uphold the true and sincere policy concept of Africa and a correct view of justice and benefit, go hand in hand with Zimbabwe and other African friendly countries, and make the path of mutual benefit and common development between China and Africa wider and better. At present, the Chinese people are working hard to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Zimbabwe is actively promoting the ""Sustainable Economic and Social Transformation Plan"" and is committed to achieving economic independence and independent and sustainable development. I look forward to through this visit, in-depth exchanges with President Mugabe and friends from all walks of life in Zimbabwe, to enhance friendship between the two countries, explore new opportunities for cooperation in various fields, and bring more benefits to the people of the two countries. ——We should continue to understand and support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests and major concerns. China firmly supports Zimbabwe’s safeguarding of national sovereignty, security and development interests and Zimbabwe’s choice of development path according to its own national conditions. , ——We must closely link the development strategies of the two countries, transform the complementary advantages of the economy into more tangible results of cooperation, and strengthendevelopment route. -We must closely link the development strategies of the two countries, transform the complementary economic advantages into more tangible results of cooperation, strengthen the exchange of development ideas, and promote the improvement of pragmatic cooperation. ——We should strengthen humanities exchanges, strengthen cooperation in the fields of education, culture, health, tourism, youth, think tanks, and media, consolidate the friendly public opinion and social foundation of the two countries, and let the friendship between China and Tianjin pass from generation to generation. -We must strengthen international cooperation and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries. China appreciates Zimbabwe's important contribution to maintaining African unity and promoting African development as the African Union's rotating presidency. After concluding his visit to Zimbabwe, President Mugabe and I will travel to South Africa to attend the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. This is the second summit held in the 15 years since the establishment of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum and the first China-Africa summit held on the African continent. There is a proverb in Zimbabwe called ""a wood fire is not well cooked and szaza"", and the Chinese often say that ""all people gather firewood with high flames"". I look forward to meeting with leaders of African countries at the China-Africa Cooperation Forum Summit to discuss friendship and seek cooperation, raise China-Africa unity to a new height, and create a bright future for China-Africa friendly cooperation. In Harare in November, the fiery red phoenix blossoms full of branches, bringing people enthusiasm, hope and strength. I believe that with the careful cultivation of the people of China and Tianjin, the flower of friendship between China and Tianjin will surely bloom more brilliantly! (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th), Note: Sadza (Sadza) means white cornmeal in the official Zimbabwe Shona language, and is a favorite staple food of the Zimbabwean people.

9,69,"[, Mr. Chairman, colleagues: In November last year, we gathered in Beijing to jointly paint a blueprint for the development of the Asia-Pacific region. After a lapse of one year, we met again, the goal is still to deepen Asia-Pacific cooperation and promote the common development of Asia-Pacific. The Philippines has done a lot of work to prepare for this informal meeting of APEC leaders. We are grateful for this. Two days ago, the leaders of the Group of 20 gathered in Antalya to work together for the world economy. Everyone generally believes that there is still much uncertainty in the world economy, but we have reason to be confident in the prospects. , Asia Pacific is the epitome of the world. In the context of weak world economic recovery, weak demand, and divergent trends, the Asia-Pacific economy is also facing various challenges such as an unstable growth foundation, the conversion of old and new power, and incomplete structural adjustments. However, the Asia-Pacific economy is still the locomotive that drives the world economy. We should base ourselves on the present and the future, use the important platform of APEC to promote win-win cooperation, and let Asia-Pacific continue to lead global growth. -We must focus on the long-term and improve the strategic framework for Asia-Pacific medium- and long-term cooperation. The ancient Chinese sages said: ""If you don't stand up, there is nothing that can't happen in the world."" People can't do without ideals, and cooperation can't lack direction. Asia-Pacific cooperation must face the future, lead the future, plan generously and shape the overall pattern. , In the past period, we have been making efforts in this direction. Last year, we launched the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Zone process and formulated a blueprint for connectivity. This year, we continue to work on formulating strategic frameworks and action plans in multiple areas. We must maintain the strategic, forward-looking and aggressive nature of cooperation and determine the goals, measures and timetables in key areas. China has submitted a progress report on the implementation of the outcome of the Beijing Conference to this meeting. We hope that each member will put the consensus reached by the leaders on the priority of all work. -We must reform and innovate and seek new growth drivers for the Asia-Pacific economy. At present, in the face of the new situation and new challenges, only reform and innovation can work together to twist the valve of the Asia-Pacific economy and unleash powerful power. , We must promote the transformation of development mode and the adjustment of economic structure. It is necessary to accelerate the pace of innovation and make the water of economic rivers alive, flowing continuously. China is in favor of formulating and implementing the ""Service Industry Cooperation Framework"" and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the global market. We must also implement the Strategic Blueprint for Promoting the Development and Cooperation of Global Value Chains to enhance the economic growth of gold. Urbanization, the Internet economy, and the blue economy are all areas of cooperation with great potential. It is necessary to expand and deepen cooperation between all parties, release positive effects, and create new economic growth points. I would like to announce that China will host the first APEC Urbanization High-level Forum next year to build an exchange and cooperation platform for Asia-Pacific urbanization cooperation. -We must promote integration and create an open Asia-Pacific economy. APEC should play a leading and coordinating role, strengthen the regional trade agreement information exchange mechanism, promote the coordinated development of regional trade agreements, and build an institutionalized platform for the Asia-Pacific open economy. , We must speed up the process and establish the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area as soon as possible. To complete the joint strategic study on schedule, draw conclusions and recommendations that are in line with the long-term interests of all parties, and make solid preparations for moving to the next stage of work. In advancing the process of regional trade agreements, all parties must maintain openness and tolerance, seek win-win cooperation, and maintain the multilateral trading system. We will continue to provide strong guidance for ending the Doha Round negotiations and promote the achievement of a balanced, meaningful, and development-oriented outcome at the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference. , ——We need to take action to turn the consensus into results. ""What you see is not what you know, what you don't know is what you do."" The blueprint for interconnection adopted by the Beijing Conference is of great significance for solving the bottleneck of Asia-Pacific development, and we must continue to vigorously promote it. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is an important supporting platform for regional interconnection. China and relevant countries are stepping up preparations. The bank is expected to be officially established before the end of this year, and the reserve project for alternative projects has also started. The Silk Road Economic Belt proposed by China and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road are steadily advancing. All parties have established priority cooperation areas focusing on economic corridors, and the Silk Road Fund’s project operations have been launched. China is willing to continue to contribute to strengthening the capacity building of APEC. Last year, China announced that it would donate US$10 million to APEC and provide 1,500 training places for developing members. At present, China has provided the first US$2.8 million to complete nearly 1,000 training sessions. Under the new situation in which Asia-Pacific has become more closely connected with the world and interests are increasingly integrated, it is of great significance to strengthen cooperation between APEC and other international mechanisms. Last year, China hosted the informal meeting of APEC leaders with 20 countriesCooperation between APEC and other international mechanisms is of great significance. Last year, China, as the host country of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting, fully coordinated with Australia, the host country of the G20 Leaders’ Summit, to achieve synergy between the two mechanisms. Next year, China and Peru will host the G20 summit and the APEC informal meeting of leaders, respectively. We are willing to strengthen collaboration with Peru and all parties to ensure the success of these two important meetings. , Colleagues! , The future of Asia-Pacific belongs to every member of the big family. Last year, we jointly advocated mutual trust, tolerance, cooperation and win-win in Beijing, and established the guiding principles of the Asia-Pacific partnership. This is a profound summary of past cooperation and a solemn commitment to future cooperation, which has important guiding significance.

10,70,"[, Dear President Putin, Dear Prime Minister Modi, Dear President Zuma, Dear President Rousseff, Dear Colleagues:, Nice to see you again. Thank you President Putin for hosting today’s meeting. After the Ufa meeting, our five countries have actively implemented various results, strengthened mutual communication and coordination, and jointly made new progress in promoting cooperation among BRICS countries. At the same time, new changes have taken place in the international situation, the world economy has been recovering slowly, geopolitical issues have become more prominent, and global challenges have emerged from time to time. Against this backdrop, the BRICS countries are also facing some new developments. First, there are more complex and difficult factors in the external environment, insufficient global total demand, intensified macroeconomic policy differentiation in various countries, and increased uncertainty in world economic growth. Second, affected by internal and external factors, the economic growth of the BRICS countries generally slowed down, and development entered an adjustment period. The third is that the voice of the declining BRICS countries has not stopped. , Real gold is not afraid of fire. The significance and value of a partner lies not only in the prosperity of the Chinese Communist Party in prosperity, but also in advancing together in adversity. As long as we strengthen our confidence and strengthen coordination, our cooperation will definitely be able to ride the wind and waves, through the clouds and fog, so that the world will have a new understanding of the quality of the BRICS countries. , To play a better role in the BRICS countries, I would like to make the following suggestions. (1) Create a favorable external development environment and jointly improve global economic governance. Recently, the causes of fluctuations in the stock and currency markets of various countries and global energy resource prices are complex, which is a transmission effect of the deep-seated impact of the international financial crisis. Therefore, we should guide all parties to form reasonable expectations for the development of the BRICS countries. It should be noted that although the economic growth rate of the BRICS countries has slowed down, emerging market countries have contributed more than 50% to world economic growth and are still an important engine of world economic growth. Looking ahead, the global economic recovery still needs the stamina and momentum of emerging market countries. We should strengthen cooperation within the framework of the G20, push all parties to increase macroeconomic policy coordination, focus on preventing short-term financial risks, and avoid currency wars and trade wars. At the same time, we must also take precautions to accelerate the construction of the BRICS New Development Bank and emergency reserve arrangements and work together to maintain international financial stability. Therefore, we should strengthen coordination and cooperation within the mechanisms of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, and strive to enhance the representation and voice of developing countries and emerging market countries in the international governance system. A few days ago, the International Monetary Fund has completed the SDR review report, which clearly pointed out that the RMB meets the free-use standard and recommended that the RMB be included in the SDR currency basket. The Chinese side welcomes this and looks forward to the BRICS countries' continued support for the RMB to enter the basket. This will help improve the international monetary system and maintain global financial stability. It will be a win-win result. (2) Speak on major international and regional issues and jointly address various global challenges. The world today is still not peaceful, regional conflicts and hotspot issues are far from being resolved, and the harm caused by terrorism is more prominent. The series of terrorist attacks in Paris once again showed that the energy and harm of terrorist forces cannot be underestimated, and terrorism has become the most serious and urgent security challenge we are currently facing. The international community must join hands to further strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other generally recognized basic norms of international relations. Special attention should be paid to both the symptoms and the root cause, and no double standards. The BRICS countries should carry out extensive cooperation in the areas of counter-terrorism experience exchange, intelligence sharing, clue verification, and law enforcement cooperation. At present, the problem of refugees in Europe is outstanding. The root cause lies in regional instability and uneven development. The solution is to seek peace and achieve development. Recently, the parties concerned have held two successive foreign ministers’ meetings on Syria, and reached many important consensuses on achieving a comprehensive ceasefire, initiating the political process, establishing a transition management mechanism, and holding general elections. We must do a good job in implementing the process of political transition under the auspices of the United Nations to maintain this hard-won momentum. (3) Promote mutually beneficial and win-win international development cooperation and jointly advocate a new type of global development partnership. This year is the International Year of Development. Two months ago, I attended the UN Development Summit with my colleagues. I feel that many developing countries care about BRICS cooperation and look forward to their role in development issues and South-South cooperation. We should work with the vast number of developing countries to push developed countries to honour their commitments and fulfill their obligations, and work hard to establish a more diversified, open, pragmatic and effective new global development partnership. We should combine the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda, exchange development ideas with developing countries, share development experience, and deepen South-South cooperation. We must not only implement sustainable 2030Sustainable development agenda, exchange development ideas with developing countries, share development experience, and deepen South-South cooperation. We must not only be the leader in implementing the 2030 sustainable development agenda, but also help other developing countries implement the agenda. (4) Join hands to promote economic optimization and upgrading and jointly achieve long-term development. The BRICS countries are entering the ranks of middle-income countries one after another, facing the same or similar tasks. Our development model must change from relying on factor input to relying on labor productivity improvement, the development concept should change from focusing on speed to focusing on quality and efficiency, the economic structure must change from relatively unitary to balanced and reasonable, and economic growth must rely on export mainly to expand domestic demand. change. These four changes have provided us with new cooperation space and opportunities. We should combine the implementation of the BRICS economic partnership strategy adopted at the Ufa meeting, and work together to create a value chain and a large market for shared benefits. With the deepening of structural adjustments and reforms, China has increasingly become a consumer product market and a country that produces capacity and capital. We hope to share development opportunities with other BRICS countries and improve the level of economic cooperation. , Colleagues! , The Antalya Summit of the G20 leaders is the next very important meeting in today’s world landscape and situation. We must support and echo each other and further promote the G20’s transition from a crisis response mechanism to a long-term governance mechanism. Focus on cyclical policies and simultaneously promote structural reforms. We must build an open world economy and oppose trade protectionism. It is necessary to promote all parties to adopt responsible macroeconomic policies, avoid negative spillover effects, and jointly expand global total demand. China will hold the eleventh summit of the leaders of the G20 next year. China thanks the BRICS member countries for their invaluable support in organizing the meeting in China, and regards hosting the G20 leaders' summit next year as an important opportunity to promote cooperation among the BRICS countries. Next year, India will also assume the presidency of the BRICS countries. China will fully support India in hosting the meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries next year. It is hoped that these two important events will echo each other, complement each other, and jointly contribute to the promotion of world economic development and the deepening of BRICS cooperation under the new situation. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Antalya, Turkey, November 15th), ""People's Daily"" (November 16, 2015, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Open up opportunities to meet challenges,2229,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-11-16,"[, 尊敬的普京总统，, 尊敬的莫迪总理，, 尊敬的祖马总统，, 尊敬的罗塞夫总统，, 各位同事：, 　　很高兴再次见到各位同事。感谢普京总统主持今天的会晤。乌法会晤后，我们五国积极落实各项成果，加强相互沟通和协调，共同推动金砖国家合作取得了新进展。, 　　同时，国际形势发生新变化，世界经济复苏缓慢，地缘政治问题较前突出，全球性挑战不时涌现。在这个大背景下，金砖国家发展也面临一些新情况。一是外部环境中复杂和困难因素增多，全球总需求不足，各国宏观经济政策分化加剧，世界经济增长不确定性加大。二是受内外因素影响，金砖国家经济增长普遍放缓，发展进入调整期。三是国际上唱衰金砖国家的声音并未停止。, 　　真金不怕火炼。伙伴的意义和价值，不仅在于顺境中共襄盛举，更在于逆境时携手前行。只要我们坚定信心、加强协调，我们的合作就一定能乘风破浪、穿云破雾，让世界对金砖国家的成色有新的认识。, 　　对金砖国家更好发挥作用，我愿提出以下建议。, 　　（一）塑造有利外部发展环境，共同完善全球经济治理。近期，各国股市汇市及全球能源资源价格波动成因复杂，是国际金融危机深层次影响的传导效应。, 　　我们应该引导各方对金砖国家发展形成合理预期。要看到金砖国家经济增速虽然有所放缓，但新兴市场国家对世界经济增长的贡献超过50%，仍然是世界经济增长的重要引擎。展望未来，全球经济复苏仍然需要新兴市场国家提供后劲和动力。我们应该在二十国集团框架内加强合作，推动各方加大宏观经济政策协调力度，重点防范短期金融风险，避免货币战、贸易战。同时，我们也要未雨绸缪，加快推进金砖国家新开发银行和应急储备安排的机制建设，共同维护国际金融稳定。, 　　我们应该加强在国际货币基金组织、世界银行、世界贸易组织等机制内的协调和配合，着力提升发展中国家和新兴市场国家在国际治理体系中的代表性和发言权。日前，国际货币基金组织已经完成特别提款权审查报告，明确指出人民币满足可自由使用标准，建议将人民币纳入特别提款权货币篮子。中方对此表示欢迎，也期待金砖国家继续支持人民币“入篮”。这有利于完善国际货币体系，维护全球金融稳定，将是一个共赢的结果。, 　　（二）就重大国际和地区问题发声，共同应对各种全球性挑战。当今世界仍然不太平，地区冲突和热点问题远未解决，恐怖主义带来的危害更加突出。发生在巴黎的系列恐怖袭击事件再次表明，恐怖势力的能量和危害不容低估，恐怖主义已成为我们当前面临的最严峻和急迫的安全挑战。国际社会必须携起手来，按照联合国宪章宗旨和原则以及其他公认的国际关系基本准则，进一步加强反恐合作，特别要注重标本兼治，不搞双重标准。金砖国家应该在反恐经验交流、情报分享、线索核查、执法合作等领域开展广泛合作。, 　　当前，欧洲难民问题突出，其根源在于地区不稳定和发展不平衡，解决的出路在于谋求和平、实现发展。近期，有关各方接连召开了两次叙利亚问题外长会议，在实现全面停火、启动政治进程、成立过渡管理机制、举行大选等方面达成了不少重要共识。我们要抓好落实，在联合国主持下，开启政治过渡进程，保持这一来之不易的势头。, 　　（三）推动互利共赢的国际发展合作，共同倡导新型全球发展伙伴关系。今年是国际发展年。两个月前，我同各位同事一道出席了联合国发展峰会。我感到很多发展中国家关心金砖国家合作，期待金砖国家在发展问题和南南合作方面发挥作用。, 　　我们应该同广大发展中国家一道，推动发达国家兑现承诺、履行义务，为建立更加多元开放、务实有效的新型全球发展伙伴关系而努力。我们应该结合落实2030年可持续发展议程，同发展中国家交流发展理念，分享发展经验，深化南南合作。我们不但要做执行2030年可持续发展议程的领跑者，而且要帮助其他发展中国家落实议程。, 　　（四）携手推进经济优化升级，共同实现长远发展。金砖国家正在相继进入中等收入国家行列，面临着相同或相似的任务。我们的发展模式要从依靠要素投入向依靠劳动生产率提高转变，发展理念要从侧重速度向注重质量和效益转变，经济结构要从相对单一向均衡合理转变，经济增长要从主要依靠出口向扩大内需转变。这四大转变为我们提供了新的合作空间和合作机遇。我们应该结合落实乌法会晤通过的金砖国家经济伙伴战略，携手打造利益共享的价值链和大市场。, 　　伴随结构调整和改革深化，中国越来越成为消费品市场和产能、资本输出国。我们希望同其他金砖国家共享发展机遇，提高经济合作水平。, 　　各位同事！, 　　二十国集团领导人安塔利亚峰会是当今世界格局和形势下一次非常重要的会议，我们要相互支持和呼应，进一步推动二十国集团从危机应对机制向长效治理机制转变，既注重周期性政策，也同步推动结构性改革。要建设开放型世界经济，反对贸易保护主义。要推动各方均采取负责任的宏观经济政策，力避负面外溢效应，共同扩大全球总需求。, 　　中国将于明年举办二十国集团领导人第十一次峰会。中方感谢金砖成员国对中国办会的宝贵支持，将主办明年二十国集团领导人峰会视为推动金砖国家合作的重要机遇。, 　　明年，印度也将接任金砖国家主席国，中方会全力支持印方主办好明年金砖国家领导人会晤。希望这两场重要活动能够相互呼应，相得益彰，共同在新形势下为推动世界经济发展和深化金砖国家合作作出贡献。, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社土耳其安塔利亚11月15日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2015年11月16日 03 版）, ]",习近平：开拓机遇  应对挑战,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27817853
11,71,"[, November 6th, on a state visit to Singapore, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in Singapore’s Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, entitled ""Inheriting the Future and Creating a Better Future for China-New Zealand Relations"". The article is as follows:, inheriting the past and creating a bright future for China-Singapore relations, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, at the invitation of Singapore’s President Mr. Chen Qingyan, with the friendly feelings for the Singaporean people and good wishes for the development of relations between the two countries, I will soon conduct state affairs in Singapore access. , I am no stranger to Singapore, the garden country, and have visited here many times. Singapore is full of vigorous development vitality, unique natural scenery and exquisite urban landscape blending, the people live and work in peace, warmth and friendliness, I am impressed every time. My visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of the founding of Singapore and the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Singapore, which is more important. In the 50 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Singaporean government and people have adapted to local conditions, forged ahead, pioneered and innovated, embarked on a unique development path, achieved economic prosperity, social stability, ethnic harmony, and played a unique and important role in international and regional affairs. The role. Singapore’s development achievements not only bring well-being to its own people, but also enlighten the development of other Asian countries. It is believed that under the leadership of this government, Singapore will achieve greater achievements in the process of nation building. In the 25 years since China and New Zealand established diplomatic relations, the two countries have helped each other, supported each other, and learned from each other, which has promoted the development of their respective countries. Over the past 25 years, China-Singapore relations have achieved leapfrog development. China is Singapore’s largest trading partner, and the bilateral trade volume reached 79.74 billion U.S. dollars last year, which is 28 times that of the initial establishment of diplomatic relations. Singapore was one of the earliest countries to participate in China's opening up, and it is currently China's largest source of investment and an important offshore RMB trading center. Following the successful cooperation between the two major projects of Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City in China, the third intergovernmental cooperation project is coming. The pragmatic cooperation in the fields of finance, science and technology, environmental protection, education and culture, social governance, law enforcement and security in the two countries has been further promoted with fruitful results. It is not an accident of history that China-Singapore relations have developed tremendously. First, thanks to the leaders of the two countries always view and plan the development of the relationship between the two countries from a strategic and long-term perspective, and point out the way forward, which provides a strong guarantee for China-Singapore relations to keep on the fast track of development no matter how the international situation changes. . The second is to benefit from the strategic direction of both sides to closely follow China's development, to meet Singapore's unique advantages and development needs, to comply with the trend of the times in the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, to continue to develop pragmatic and inclusive cooperation, and carefully build cooperative flagship projects to promote economic and trade , Investment, finance, science and technology, humanities and other practical cooperation in various fields blossomed. The third is to benefit from the continuous innovation consciousness and pioneering thinking of the two sides to collaborate and collaborate to incubate social governance, food safety, modern service industry, interconnection and other new areas of cooperation that meet the needs of the development strategies of the two countries. The development of new relationships provides an endless source of motivation. , Fan Yi's way, go with the times. Today, China-Singapore relations are at a new historical starting point. We must continue to build on the future and create a better tomorrow for China-Singapore relations. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share three suggestions for developing China-New Zealand relations. , ——We must continue to do top-level design. It is necessary to inherit the strategic planning and the “heirloom” of Sino-Singaporean relations led by high-level leaders, maintain the momentum of close high-level exchanges, enhance political mutual trust, strengthen strategic communication, adhere to mutual understanding and respect each other, and constantly strengthen the political foundation of bilateral relations. , ——We want to deepen and expand pragmatic cooperation. China is taking the initiative to lead the new normal of economic development, stepping up the formulation of the ""13th Five-Year Plan"", deepening reforms, expanding opening up, implementing innovation-driven development strategies, and adjusting and optimizing the economic structure. Singapore is preparing a five-year plan for ""scientific research, innovation and enterprises"" to implement a new round of economic development. The two sides should step up their joint development strategies, expand common interests, solidly promote cooperation projects, explore new growth points for cooperation, and promote pragmatic cooperation to upgrade quality. ——We want to cooperate closely in regional and international affairs. China is committed to maintaining and developing good-neighborly friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries, adhering to the concept of sincere and gracious surrounding diplomacy, deeply promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road”, and building a closer China-ASEAN Community of Destiny and Asia. Singapore is an important ASEAN country. Since this year, it has taken over as the coordinator of China-ASEAN relations and has important influence on the regional and international arenas. The two parties should work together to promote various cooperation initiatives, focus on development cooperation, and be a promoter of regional integration, a promoter of peaceful development in Asia, and a contributor to the well-being of the people of the world. , I look forward toDiscussion, focusing on development cooperation, being a promoter of regional integration, a promoter of peaceful development in Asia, and a contributor to the well-being of the people of the world. , I look forward to having an in-depth exchange of views with the Singaporean leaders on the above ideas and suggestions to push China-Singapore relations to a higher level. ""The friendship is solemn and the gold is similar."" China is willing to work with Singapore to inherit and develop the cause of China-Singapore friendship created and elaborated by leaders of the older generation, to move forward hand in hand, so that China-Singapore friendship is as vibrant as the rain trees planted in Singapore.

The article is as follows: To join hands in creating a better tomorrow for China-Vietnam relations, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, at the invitation of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Ruan Fuzhong and President Zhang Jinchuang, I will soon pay a state visit to Vietnam. This is a visit to the neighbor's house and a visit to the gay house. I am very happy. , My current visit to Vietnam is the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam. Speaking of China and Vietnam, when it comes to Sino-Vietnamese relations, we all think of the well-known song ""Vietnam-China, mountains and mountains, water and water"" familiar to the people of the two countries. Listen to the roosters singing."" As friendly neighbors connected by mountains and rivers, the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam has a long history. Since modern times, the people of China and Vietnam have supported each other and shared difficulties in the struggle for national independence and national liberation, leaving many good stories. The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, once founded the ""Vietnamese Youth Revolutionary Comrades Association"" in China and guided the development of the Vietnamese revolutionary activities. ""Brothers"" and other popular poems. In response to President Ho Chi Minh’s call, the well-known Vietnamese general flooded actively participated in the Chinese revolution and participated in the Long March of the Red Army, becoming the only foreign general in the founding generals of New China and the rare ""two-state general"" in the world. China once fully supported Vietnam in its national liberation struggle. The main research achievement of artemisinin by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this year, is derived from the anti-malarial drug research carried out by China in the 1960s to support Vietnam. There are too many such stories, and they are still widely praised among the people of both countries. In the new era, China and Vietnam, as two countries with the same ideals and convictions and connected futures and destinies, help each other and support each other in the cause of socialist construction. The bilateral relations have become increasingly rich in connotation, their common interests have become broader, and pragmatic cooperation has achieved fruitful results. China and Vietnam have established a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and established a number of cooperation mechanisms such as the Bilateral Cooperation Steering Committee to promote significant achievements in cooperation in the areas of economy, trade and humanities. China has been Vietnam’s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years. Vietnam has become China’s second largest trading partner in ASEAN, and bilateral trade volume is expected to achieve the goal of 100 billion US dollars in advance. Last year, there were more than 3 million people between the two countries, and there were 71 weekly flights between China and Vietnam. What is even more commendable is that China and Vietnam have resolved the demarcation of the land and the Beibu Gulf through friendly consultations, laying a solid foundation for the stability and common development of the border areas of the two countries. These achievements fully prove that consolidating China-Vietnam friendship and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation are in the fundamental interests of the two countries and bring benefits to the two peoples. They are conducive to the respective development and stability of the two countries and are conducive to regional peace and prosperity. At present, both China and Vietnam are in a critical period of reform and development. The Chinese people are working in accordance with the strategic layout of building a well-off society in an all-round way, deepening reforms in an all-round way, ruling the country in accordance with the law, and ruling the party strictly, and working together to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . Vietnam is preparing for the twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and is stepping up the building of a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, fair, and civilized. Against this background, developing Sino-Vietnamese friendship and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation is not only an important mission entrusted to us by history, but also a common demand for advancing the construction of their respective countries, which is in line with the strategic interests of both parties. As a good neighbor, good friend, good comrade and good partner, China wishes the Vietnamese Communist Party to successfully convene the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. China will adhere to the neighboring diplomatic policy of being good neighbors and neighbors, and adhering to the concept of sincere and gracious neighboring diplomacy. We are committed to building a community of shared future for Asia and promoting the continued healthy and stable development of China-Vietnam relations in the new period. -We must keep the overall situation in mind, take a long-term perspective, and grasp the correct direction for the development of Sino-Vietnamese relations. China is willing to maintain high-level exchanges with Vietnam in a flexible and diverse manner, strengthen strategic communication, exchange views on Sino-Vietnamese relations and major issues of mutual interest in a timely manner, and consolidate the political foundation of bilateral relations. -We must persist in mutual learning, strengthen cooperation, and achieve common development and prosperity. Both sides should continue to play the overall coordination role of the Bilateral Cooperation Steering Committee, and jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” and “Two Corridors and One Circle” through the realization of the development strategy of the two countries.The coordinating role of the Steering Committee on Border Cooperation, through the realization of the development strategy of the two countries, jointly promote the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" and ""two corridors and one circle"", expand production capacity cooperation, strengthen infrastructure interconnection cooperation, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. Chinese people bring more welfare. -We must persist in expanding exchanges, enhancing understanding, and consolidating the basis of public opinion in bilateral relations. The development of Sino-Vietnamese relations is inseparable from the understanding and support of the two peoples. China will, as always, support and encourage the two countries to strengthen cultural exchanges, expand non-governmental friendly exchanges, and carry out various friendly exchange activities such as youth friendly meetings, youth festivals, and people's forums, so that China-Vietnam friendship will be passed on from generation to generation. ——We must insist on mutual understanding, friendly consultations, and properly handle existing problems. Both sides should make good use of government border negotiations and other mechanisms, and on the basis of drawing on the successful experience of demarcation of land borders and Beibu Gulf, insist on seeking a basic and long-term solution to the maritime issue acceptable to both sides through dialogue and consultation. In this process, the two sides should work together to maintain maritime stability, actively explore maritime cooperation, and create good conditions for the development of bilateral relations. , China has an old saying: ""If you do your best, you can do everything; if you do all the wisdom, you can do everything."" There is a saying in Vietnam: ""One tree cannot be a forest, and three trees can form a mountain."" I look forward to During the visit, he conducted in-depth communication with Vietnamese leaders to plan the direction of the development of Sino-Vietnamese relations in the future, so as to make China-Vietnam relations stable and far-reaching. I believe that as long as China and Vietnam go hand in hand and strengthen cooperation, they will surely create a better tomorrow for China-Vietnam relations and realize the common development and prosperity of China and Vietnam.

13,73,"[, Dear Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Dear Director of Mlambo-Nuka, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends:, 70th Anniversary of the United Nations, 20th Anniversary of the World Women’s Congress in Beijing On this occasion, we are holding a global women’s summit here, and it is of great significance to reaffirm our commitment and seek for the future in order to promote gender equality and women’s development. Women are the creators of material and spiritual civilization, and an important force to promote social development and progress. Without women, there would be no human beings, and there would be no society. The pursuit of equality between men and women is great. Throughout history, without women's liberation and progress, there would be no human liberation and progress. In order to realize the lofty ideal of equality between men and women, mankind has gone through an uneven and extraordinary course. From the birth of the world’s first declaration of women’s rights more than 200 years ago, to the establishment of the International Women’s Day on March 8, to the establishment of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, to the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, every step of women’s career development All have promoted the progress of human civilization. 20 years ago, in Beijing, the Fourth World Conference on Women adopted the ""Beijing Declaration"" and ""Programme of Action"" to reach strategic goals and policy frameworks that promote equality between men and women and guarantee women's rights. Today, the spirit proclaimed by the Beijing World Conference on Women has produced positive changes in the world. The pursuit of equality between men and women in various countries has been increasingly strengthened, women’s development actions have become more diversified, and the environment for women’s survival and development has been continuously optimized. The UN Women has done a lot of work, which deserves full recognition. After continuous efforts, many previously unreachable dreams have become a reality: 143 countries around the world have passed legislation clearly stipulating equality between men and women. There is no legal obstacle to women’s participation in political and economic activities. Women’s access to education, freedom of marriage, freedom of occupation, etc. Has become a social consensus. At the same time, looking around the world, the development level of women in various countries and regions is still uneven. The rights, opportunities, and resources of men and women are still unequal. The society’s awareness of women’s potential, talents, and contributions is still insufficient. Now more than half of the 800 million poor people in the world are women. Whenever wars and epidemics strike, women often bear the brunt. In the face of terror and violence, women are also greatly affected. To this day, various forms of discrimination against women still exist, and abuses and even devastation of women occur from time to time. , The facts show that to achieve equality between men and women, we also need to make great efforts. We must make unremitting efforts to open up a broad road for the development of women's cause. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , We have just adopted the post-2015 development agenda, and the gender perspective has been integrated into all areas of the new development agenda. Let us carry forward the spirit of the Beijing World Women’s Congress and reaffirm our commitment to accelerate action to promote equality between men and women and the overall development of women. First, promote the simultaneous development of women and economic society. Development is inseparable from women, and development must benefit all people, including women. We need to formulate a more scientific and rational development strategy. We must not only consider national conditions, gender differences, and special needs of women, to ensure women’s equal sharing of development results, but also innovate policy measures to stimulate women’s potential and promote women’s participation in economic and social development. China's practice has proved that promoting women's participation in social and economic activities can effectively improve the status of women, and can greatly enhance social productivity and economic vitality. Second, actively protect women's rights and interests. Women’s rights and interests are basic human rights. We must incorporate the protection of women’s rights and interests into laws and regulations, raise it to the will of the state, and internalize it into a code of social conduct. It is necessary to enhance women's ability to participate in political and economic activities, improve women's participation in decision-making and management, and enable women to become leaders in politics, business, and academia. We must guarantee women’s basic medical and health services, and pay particular attention to the health needs of rural women, disabled women, migrant women, middle-aged and elderly women, and ethnic minority women. We must take measures to ensure that all girls can go to school and go to school safely, develop vocational education and lifelong education for women, and help them adapt to changes in society and the job market. , Third, strive to build a harmonious and inclusive social culture. Men and women share a world, and eliminating discrimination and prejudice against women will make society more inclusive and dynamic. We must strive to eliminate all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence. We must take equality between men and women as the core and break down backward concepts and stereotypes that hinder women’s development. I appreciate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's ""He for Her"" initiative and hope more and more men will participate. Fourth, create an international environment conducive to women’s development. Women and children are the biggest victims of all factors of peace and restlessness. We must strengthen the concept of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, cherish peace more, actively maintain peace, and let everyThe biggest victim of all factors of peace and restlessness. We must strengthen the philosophy of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, cherish peace more, actively maintain peace, and let every woman and child be bathed in happy and peaceful sunlight. , Women's organizations of various countries should strengthen exchanges, enhance friendship, develop together, and make progress together. To continue to carry out international development cooperation in the field of women, developed countries should increase financial and technical assistance to developing countries and narrow the development gap between women in various countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In the process of the Chinese people's pursuit of a better life, every woman has the opportunity to make her life come true and her dreams come true. China will be more active in implementing the basic national policy of equality between men and women, giving play to the role of women in ""half the sky"", and supporting women in making contributions and realizing their ideals and dreams in life. Chinese women will continue to promote the development of the world women’s movement through their own development and make greater contributions to the cause of equality between men and women around the world. To support the global women’s cause and the work of the UN Women’s Agency, China will donate US$10 million to the UN Women’s Agency to support the implementation of the “Beijing Declaration” and “Programme of Action” and the implementation of the relevant goals of the post-2015 development agenda. In the next five years, China will help developing countries implement 100 ""Maternal and Child Health Projects"" and send medical expert groups to carry out patrolling activities; implement 100 ""Happy Campus Projects"" to provide school assistance to poor girls and increase girls' enrollment rate; Invite 30,000 women from developing countries to come to China for training, and train 100,000 female professional technicians for developing countries locally. Under the relevant fund established by China in cooperation with the United Nations, special projects will be carried out to support the capacity building of women in developing countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Let us work together to accelerate action and build a better world for all women and all people! , I wish the summit a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, September 27th),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the Global Women's Summit,2072,来源：人民网-人民日报          发布时间：2015-09-28,"[, 尊敬的潘基文秘书长，, 尊敬的姆兰博—努卡主任，, 尊敬的各位同事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 在联合国成立70周年、北京世界妇女大会召开20周年之际，我们在这里举行全球妇女峰会，为促进男女平等和妇女发展重申承诺、共谋未来，意义重大。, 妇女是物质文明和精神文明的创造者，是推动社会发展和进步的重要力量。没有妇女，就没有人类，就没有社会。, 追求男女平等的事业是伟大的。纵观历史，没有妇女解放和进步，就没有人类解放和进步。为实现男女平等的崇高理想，人类走过了不平坦、不平凡的历程。从200多年前世界第一份妇女权利宣言诞生，到“三八”国际劳动妇女节的设立，到联合国成立妇女地位委员会，到通过《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，妇女事业发展的每一步都推动了人类文明进步。, 20年前，在北京，第四次世界妇女大会通过了《北京宣言》和《行动纲领》，达成促进男女平等、保障妇女权利的战略目标和政策框架。今天，北京世界妇女大会所宣示的精神，在世界催生了积极变化。各国追求男女平等共识日益强化，推动妇女发展行动更趋多样化，妇女生存发展环境不断优化。联合国妇女署做了大量工作，值得充分肯定。, 经过持续不断努力，许多以前遥不可及的梦想已经成为现实：全球143个国家通过立法明确规定男女平等，妇女参与政治经济活动在法律上已经没有障碍，妇女接受教育、婚姻自由、职业自由等已经成为社会共识。, 同时，环顾世界，各国各地区妇女发展水平仍然不平衡，男女权利、机会、资源分配仍然不平等，社会对妇女潜能、才干、贡献的认识仍然不充分。现在全球8亿贫困人口中，一半以上是妇女。每当战乱和疫病来袭，妇女往往首当其冲。面对恐怖和暴力肆虐，妇女也深受其害。时至今日，针对妇女的各种形式歧视依然存在，虐待甚至摧残妇女的事情时有发生。, 事实表明，实现男女平等，还需要我们付出巨大努力。我们要不懈努力，为妇女事业发展开辟广阔道路。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 我们刚刚通过2015年后发展议程，性别视角已纳入新发展议程各个领域。让我们发扬北京世界妇女大会精神，重申承诺，为促进男女平等和妇女全面发展加速行动。, 第一，推动妇女和经济社会同步发展。发展离不开妇女，发展要惠及包括妇女在内的全体人民。我们要制定更加科学合理的发展战略，既要考虑各国国情、性别差异、妇女特殊需求，确保妇女平等分享发展成果，又要创新政策手段，激发妇女潜力，推动广大妇女参与经济社会发展。中国实践证明，推动妇女参加社会和经济活动，能有效提高妇女地位，也能极大提升社会生产力和经济活力。, 第二，积极保障妇女权益。妇女权益是基本人权。我们要把保障妇女权益系统纳入法律法规，上升为国家意志，内化为社会行为规范。要增强妇女参与政治经济活动能力，提高妇女参与决策管理水平，使妇女成为政界、商界、学界的领军人物。我们要保障妇女基本医疗卫生服务，特别是要关注农村妇女、残疾妇女、流动妇女、中老年妇女、少数族裔妇女的健康需求。我们要采取措施确保所有女童上得起学和安全上学，发展面向妇女的职业教育和终身教育，帮助她们适应社会和就业市场变化。, 第三，努力构建和谐包容的社会文化。男女共有一个世界，消除对妇女的歧视和偏见，将使社会更加包容和更有活力。我们要努力消除一切形式针对妇女的暴力，包括家庭暴力。我们要以男女平等为核心，打破有碍妇女发展的落后观念和陈规旧俗。我赞赏潘基文秘书长发起的“他为她”倡议，希望越来越多男性参与进来。, 第四，创造有利于妇女发展的国际环境。妇女和儿童是一切不和平不安宁因素的最大受害者。我们要坚定和平发展和合作共赢理念，倍加珍惜和平，积极维护和平，让每个妇女和儿童都沐浴在幸福安宁的阳光里。, 各国妇女团体应该加强交流，增进友谊，共同发展，共同进步。要继续开展妇女领域国际发展合作，发达国家要加大对发展中国家的资金和技术援助，缩小各国妇女发展差距。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 在中国人民追求美好生活的过程中，每一位妇女都有人生出彩和梦想成真的机会。中国将更加积极贯彻男女平等基本国策，发挥妇女“半边天”作用，支持妇女建功立业、实现人生理想和梦想。中国妇女也将通过自身发展不断促进世界妇女运动发展，为全球男女平等事业作出更大贡献。, 为支持全球妇女事业和联合国妇女署工作，中国将向妇女署捐款1000万美元，用于支持落实《北京宣言》和《行动纲领》，落实2015年后发展议程相关目标。在今后5年内，中国将帮助发展中国家实施100个“妇幼健康工程”，派遣医疗专家小组开展巡医活动；实施100个“快乐校园工程”，向贫困女童提供就学资助，提高女童入学率；邀请3万名发展中国家妇女来华参加培训，并在当地为发展中国家培训10万名女性职业技术人员。在中国同联合国合作设立的有关基金项下，将专门开展支持发展中国家妇女能力建设的项目。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 让我们携手努力，加速行动，共建共享一个对所有妇女、对所有人更加美好的世界！, 预祝峰会圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社联合国9月27日电）, ]",习近平在全球妇女峰会上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27641163
14,74,"[, Mr. Chairman, colleagues: I am very happy to attend today's summit. On the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, it is of great significance for leaders of all countries to gather in New York to discuss development plans. For the people of all countries, development depends on survival and hope, and symbolizes dignity and rights. It is with this wish that 15 years ago, we formulated the Millennium Development Goals, hoping to help hundreds of millions of people live a better life. , Looking back, we have experienced sustained global economic growth and also suffered severely from the international financial crisis. We have witnessed the rise of developing countries and are also facing the reality of unbalanced development between North and South. We are deeply encouraged not only for 1.1 billion people out of poverty, but also for more than 800 million people still starving. , Looking around the world, peace and development remain the two major themes of our times. To solve various global challenges, including the recent refugee crisis in Europe, the fundamental way out is to seek peace and achieve development. Facing many challenges and difficulties, we must hold on to this key. Only development can eliminate the root causes of conflict. Only development can guarantee the basic rights of the people. Only development can satisfy people's longing for a better life. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! , The post-2015 development agenda adopted by this summit portrays a new vision for global development and provides new opportunities for international development cooperation. We should take this as a new starting point and jointly embark on a fair, open, comprehensive and innovative development road, and strive to achieve common development of all countries. -We must strive for fair development and make development opportunities more equal. All countries should become participants, contributors and beneficiaries of global development. It is impossible for one country to develop, other countries not to develop, some countries to develop, and other countries to not develop. Countries have different capabilities and levels. Under the same goal, they should bear common but differentiated responsibilities. It is necessary to improve global economic governance, increase the representativeness and voice of developing countries, and give countries the right to participate equally in the formulation of rules. -We must adhere to the development of openness, so that the fruits of development benefit all parties. In the era of economic globalization, countries must open the door for construction and promote the free and convenient flow of production factors around the world. All countries should jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system, build an open economy, and realize mutual consultation, joint construction, and sharing. We must respect each other's development choices, learn from each other's development experience, let different development paths converge on the other side of success, and let development achievements be shared by people of all countries. , ——We must pursue comprehensive development and make the foundation of development more solid. The ultimate goal of development is for the people. While eradicating poverty and guaranteeing people's livelihood, it is necessary to maintain social fairness and justice and ensure that everyone enjoys development opportunities and development results. Efforts should be made to achieve coordinated economic, social, and environmental development, and to achieve harmony between man and society, and man and nature. ——We must promote the development of innovation and let the development potential be fully released. Innovation brings vitality, and innovation produces motivation. Problems in development can only be solved through development. Countries should use reform and innovation to stimulate development potential, enhance growth momentum, and cultivate new core competitiveness. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! , The post-2015 development agenda is a high standard task list and a heavy commitment letter. ""One deployment, nine implementations."" I propose that the international community strengthen cooperation, jointly implement the post-2015 development agenda, and strive to achieve win-win cooperation. , First, enhance the development capabilities of all countries. In the final analysis, development depends on the efforts of the country itself. The Chinese say: ""Measure yourselves and suit your needs."" All countries should formulate development strategies that suit their own national conditions based on their own endowment characteristics. The international community should help developing countries strengthen their capacity-building and provide targeted support and assistance based on their actual needs. Second, improve the international development environment. Peace and development complement each other. All countries should jointly safeguard international peace, promote development with peace, and consolidate peace with development. Development also requires a good external institutional environment, international financial institutions must accelerate governance reform, and multilateral development institutions must increase development resources. , Third, optimize the development of partnerships. Developed countries should honor their commitments and fulfill their obligations in a timely manner. The international community should maintain the status of the main channel for North-South cooperation, deepen South-South cooperation and tripartite cooperation, and support the private sector and other stakeholders to play a greater role in partnerships. Fourth, improve the development coordination mechanism. Countries should strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination to avoid negative spillover effects. Regional organizations should speed up the integration process and enhance their overall competitiveness through complementary advantages within the region. The United Nations should continue to play a leading role. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! Over the past 30 years of reform and opening up, China has developed a development with Chinese characteristics based on its own national conditionsUse leadership. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! For more than 30 years of reform and opening up, China has embarked on a development path with Chinese characteristics based on its own national conditions. China has basically achieved the Millennium Development Goals, reduced the number of poor people by 439 million, and made remarkable achievements in the fields of education, health, and women. China's development has not only enhanced the well-being of more than 1.3 billion Chinese, but has also effectively promoted the cause of global development.

15,75,"[, fellow citizens:, everyone! ""The fellow saw tears in his eyes when seeing his fellow."" It was a pleasure to be reunited with fellow compatriots in beautiful Seattle. It will be Mid-Autumn Festival in a few days. Think of family during the festive season. I know that everyone here misses the motherland and relatives who are thousands of miles away, and the motherland and relatives also care about every overseas tourist. Here, on behalf of the motherland and more than 1.3 billion compatriots, I extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all of you here, and through you, to all the compatriots who work and live in the United States! Everyone has worked hard for our visit, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you! , My current state visit to the United States at the invitation of President Obama is to deepen the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields, and promote new and greater development of the relationship between China and the United States as a new type of major power. And the people of the world. Seattle is my first stop on my visit to the United States. Next I will go to Washington for state activities, and then I will also go to New York to attend the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. In the past two days, in contact with people from all walks of life in the United States, I have deeply felt the friendly sentiment of the American people to the Chinese people, and have experienced the broad prospects for the development of Sino-US cooperation. I look forward to discussing with President Obama a plan for Sino-US cooperation and jointly creating the future of Sino-US relations. The compatriots here today come from all aspects of the United States. You represent all the overseas Chinese in the United States. For a long time, the vast number of overseas Chinese in the United States have inherited the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. They have worked hard and worked hard. While realizing their dreams in life, they have also contributed to the development and prosperity of the United States and won the respect of the American people. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the construction of the US Pacific Railway. 150 years ago, tens of thousands of Chinese laborers crossed the ocean and came to the United States to participate in the construction of this railway across the east and west of the United States. They used simple tools to open roads and bridges in the mountains and the deep valleys, paving the way to the western United States with their flesh and blood, creating an engineering miracle at that time and driving the development of the western United States. It has become a monument to the hard work, dedication and dedication of overseas Chinese in the United States. The overseas Chinese in the United States have the excellent quality of diligence and dedication, as well as the excellent tradition of patriotism and love for the hometown. You are in love with Sangzi and care about the future and destiny of the motherland. More than 70 years ago, overseas Chinese in the United States actively supported the motherland’s struggle against Japanese militarism through donations and other means, leaving a strong mark in the history of the Chinese nation’s struggle for independence and liberation. Since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, the overseas Chinese compatriots in the United States have actively supported the construction of the motherland, actively promoted the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, and made important contributions to the development, reunification and national rejuvenation of the motherland. The overseas Chinese in the United States are participants, builders, and promoters of Sino-US relations. In the course of the development of Sino-U.S. relations, overseas Chinese in the United States have used their unique advantages to travel across the Pacific, actively promoting exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, science, technology, and humanities between China and the United States, and building friendship and cooperation between the two countries and their peoples. Bridge. It can be said that the achievements made in the development of Sino-US relations over the past 30 years are inseparable from the tireless efforts of the vast number of overseas Chinese in the United States. , Fellows! The vast majority of overseas Chinese are concerned about the development of the motherland, and the strong development of the motherland is the common aspiration of everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to give you a brief introduction. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in order to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we proceeded from the reality of China's development and clearly proposed to build a well-off society in an all-round way, deepen reforms in an all-round way, and rule the country in accordance with law. The ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout of comprehensively and strictly governing the party. Building a well-off society in an all-round way is the first and crucial step in our struggle. When this goal is achieved, China's economic aggregate will reach nearly US$17 trillion, and people's living standards will be significantly improved. In order to achieve our goal of struggle, we must comprehensively deepen reforms and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities. Now the reforms are steadily advancing. Deepening reform will inevitably further promote opening up, provide a more open, relaxed, and transparent environment for foreign investment to enter China, and open up a wider space for us to cooperate with countries around the world, including the United States. At the same time, we are comprehensively advancing the rule of law, so that together with the comprehensive deepening of reforms, we will form the two wings and the two wheels for building a well-off society in an all-round way. The Communist Party of China is a political party that serves the people wholeheartedly, and it must always maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the people, so governing the country must govern the party first, and governing the party must be strict. The unhealthy tendencies and corruption within the party must be dealt with resolutely, insisting that ""tigers"" and ""flies"" fight together and be welcomed by the people. We will continue to strengthen anti-corruption according to law and anti-corruption system, and vigorously create a rule of law environment that does not dare to corrupt, cannot corrupt, or does not want to corrupt.Playing together is welcomed by the people. We will continue to strengthen anti-corruption in accordance with the law and anti-corruption in accordance with the law, and vigorously create a legal environment and political atmosphere that does not dare, cannot, or do not want to corrupt. At present, the fundamentals of China's economic development are good, the development prospects are bright, the growth is maintained at a medium to high speed, and the development is moving towards the middle and high end. In the face of the difficult and tortuous world economic recovery and the domestic economy facing significant downward pressure, we launched a series of major measures to stabilize growth, promote reform, adjust structure, benefit people's livelihood, and prevent risks, and achieved overall stability in economic and social development. In the first half of the year, the GDP grew by 7%, which means that we have grown by 780 billion US dollars a year, which is equivalent to the total economic volume of a medium-sized country. In the future, China's economy will continue to improve with a foundation, conditions and motivation. We are vigorously promoting economic restructuring and implementing innovation-driven development strategies. China has a large population and a huge market potential. There are many sources of economic growth momentum in China, and its development potential is strong. We are confident and able to cope with various risk challenges, maintain the stability of the financial market, and promote sustained and healthy economic development. The realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires a peaceful and stable international environment. We will unswervingly adhere to the path of peaceful development, unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, and firmly commit to developing friendly relations with all countries in the world, and promote the establishment of a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core. Sino-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today, and occupy a particularly important position in China's diplomatic layout. China has always viewed and grasped Sino-US relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is committed to developing long-term healthy and stable Sino-US relations. In the summer of 2013, I reached an important consensus with President Obama at the Annaberg Estate to build a new relationship between China and the United States. Over the past two years or so, with the joint efforts of both sides, China-US new-type relations between major powers have achieved fruitful results. The high-level exchanges between the two countries are frequent, cooperation in various fields has continuously made new progress, and close communication and coordination have been maintained on international, regional, and global issues. Facts have proved that the stable development of Sino-US relations not only benefits the two countries, but also benefits the world. Under the new situation, we will firmly grasp the correct direction of the relations between the two countries, continue to make the cake of common interests of the two countries, and work together to meet the common challenges of the 21st century, bringing more well-being to the peoples of the two countries and the people of the world. , Fellows! Since modern times, achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has been the common dream of Chinese children at home and abroad. Today, we are closer to achieving the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than any period in history. I believe that as an important member of the big family of the Chinese nation, the vast number of overseas Chinese compatriots in the United States will definitely be able to make unique contributions in this great process. Here, I would like to offer you some hopes. First, I hope you can actively integrate into the mainstream US society and promote local economic and social development. We must carry forward the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation's diligence and kindness, and realize the value of life through our own efforts. We must abide by the laws of the country of residence, respect local customs, live in harmony with people of all ethnic groups, develop together, and contribute wisdom and strength to local economic and social development. Secondly, I hope you can take advantage of learning from China and the West and blending China and the United States to match the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States. It is necessary to seize the opportunities of China's economic development, use its own capital, technology, management, contacts and other favorable conditions to promote pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in various fields between China and the United States, add positive energy to Sino-US relations, and contribute to the building of Sino-US friendship. Third, I hope you can proactively introduce Chinese culture and tell Chinese stories. Every overseas Chinese compatriot in the United States is an emissary of Chinese culture. I hope you can show the charm of Chinese culture by yourself, introduce a real China, enhance the understanding of the American people about China, promote the friendship between the people of China and the United States, and consolidate the foundation of public opinion on China-US relations. , ""Yu Youtian Yukang, sincerely nostalgic for his hometown."" We came to the United States this time to bring you some moon cakes from your hometown. This is a little bit of the motherland’s wishes. , Finally, I wish you all a happy Mid-Autumn Festival, good health and happy family! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Seattle, United States, September 23rd), ""People's Daily"" (September 25, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech when attending the welcome reception held by overseas Chinese in Seattle,2767,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-09-25,"[, 同胞们：, 大家好！“老乡见老乡，两眼泪汪汪。”很高兴在美丽的西雅图同各位同胞团聚。再过几天就是中秋佳节了。每逢佳节倍思亲。我知道，在座各位都很思念万里之遥的祖国和亲人，祖国和亲人也牵挂着每一位海外游子。在这里，我代表祖国和13亿多同胞，向在座各位，并通过你们，向在美国工作和生活的全体同胞，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！大家为我们这次访问付出了辛勤劳动，我向你们表示衷心的感谢！, 我这次应奥巴马总统邀请对美国进行国事访问，目的是加深两国人民友谊，促进各领域务实合作，推动中美新型大国关系建设得到新的更大发展，更多更好造福两国人民和世界人民。西雅图是我这次访美第一站，接下来我将去华盛顿进行国事活动，之后我还将去纽约出席联合国成立70周年系列峰会。, 两天来，在同美国各界人士接触中，我深深感受到美国人民对中国人民的友好情谊，也切身体会到中美合作拥有广阔发展前景。我期待着同奥巴马总统共商中美合作大计，共创中美关系未来。, 今天在座的同胞来自美国各个方面，你们代表着全体旅美侨胞。长期以来，广大旅美侨胞秉承中华民族传统美德，顽强拼搏、艰苦创业，在实现人生梦想的同时，也为美国发展繁荣作出了贡献，赢得了美国人民尊重。, 今年是美国太平洋铁路修建150周年。150年前，数以万计的华工漂洋过海来到美国，参与建设这条横跨美国东西部的铁路。他们拿着简陋的工具，在崇山峻岭和绝壁深谷中逢山开路、遇水搭桥，以血肉之躯铺就了通往美国西部的战略大通道，创造了当时的工程奇迹，带动了美国西部大开发，成为旅美侨胞奋斗、进取、奉献精神的一座丰碑。, 旅美侨胞有着勤奋敬业的优秀品质，也有着爱国爱乡的优良传统，你们情系桑梓，关心祖国前途命运。70多年前，旅美侨胞通过捐款捐物等多种方式，积极支援祖国抗击日本军国主义侵略的斗争，在中华民族争取独立解放的历史上留下浓墨重彩的一笔。新中国成立以来特别是改革开放以来，旅美侨胞踊跃支持祖国建设，积极推动两岸关系和平发展，为祖国发展、统一和民族复兴作出了重要贡献。, 旅美侨胞是中美关系的参与者、建设者、推动者。在中美关系发展历程中，旅美侨胞发挥自己独特优势，奔走于太平洋两岸，积极促进中美经济、科技、人文等各领域交流合作，在中美两国和两国人民间架起友谊和合作的桥梁。可以说，中美关系30多年发展所取得的成绩，同广大旅美侨胞不懈努力密不可分。, 同胞们！, 广大海外侨胞心系祖国发展，祖国发展强大是大家共同的心声。我愿借此机会向大家做些简要介绍。, 中共十八大以来，为了实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，我们从中国发展实际出发，明确提出全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党的“四个全面”战略布局。全面建成小康社会，是我们奋斗目标的第一步，也是关键一步。这个目标实现之时，中国经济总量将达到近17万亿美元，人民生活水平将明显提高。, 为了实现我们的奋斗目标，必须全面深化改革，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，现在改革正在稳步向前推进。深化改革必然进一步促进对外开放，为外资进入中国提供更为开放、宽松、透明的环境，为我们同包括美国在内的世界各国开展合作开辟更广阔的空间。同时，我们正在全面推进依法治国，让它同全面深化改革一起构成全面建成小康社会的两个翅膀、两个轮子。中国共产党是全心全意为人民服务的政党，必须始终保持同人民群众的血肉联系，所以治国必先治党、治党务必从严。对党内的不正之风和腐败现象，必须坚决处理，坚持“老虎”、“苍蝇”一起打，受到人民群众欢迎。我们将继续加强依法反腐、制度反腐，大力营造不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐的法治环境和政治氛围。, 当前，中国经济发展基本面良好，发展前景光明，增长保持中高速，发展迈向中高端。在世界经济复苏艰难曲折、国内经济面临较大下行压力情况下，我们推出一系列稳增长、促改革、调结构、惠民生、防风险的重大举措，实现了经济社会发展总体平稳。上半年国内生产总值增长7%，这意味着我们一年就增长七八千亿美元，相当于一个中等国家的经济总量。未来中国经济持续向好有基础有条件有动力。我们正在大力推进经济结构调整，实施创新驱动发展战略。中国人口众多，市场潜力巨大，中国经济增长动力源很多，发展后劲很足。我们有信心、有能力应对各种风险挑战，保持金融市场稳定，推动经济持续健康发展。, 实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，需要和平稳定的国际环境。我们将始终不渝坚持走和平发展道路，始终不渝奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚定致力于同世界各国发展友好关系，推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系。, 中美关系是当今世界最重要的双边关系之一，在中国外交布局中占有特殊重要位置。中国始终从战略高度和长远角度看待和把握中美关系，致力于发展长期健康稳定的中美关系。2013年夏天，我在安纳伯格庄园同奥巴马总统达成了构建中美新型大国关系的重要共识。两年多来，在双方共同努力下，中美新型大国关系建设取得了丰硕成果。两国高层交往频繁，各领域合作不断取得新进展，在国际、地区、全球性问题上保持密切沟通和协调。事实证明，中美关系保持稳定发展，不仅有利于两国，也惠及世界。新形势下，我们将牢牢把握两国关系正确方向，不断做大两国共同利益的蛋糕，携手应对21世纪的共同挑战，为两国人民乃至世界人民带来更多福祉。, 同胞们！, 近代以来，实现中华民族伟大复兴是海内外中华儿女的共同梦想。今天，我们比历史上任何时期都更加接近实现中华民族伟大复兴的目标。我相信，作为中华民族大家庭的重要成员，广大旅美侨胞一定能够在这一伟大进程中作出独特贡献。在这里，我愿向大家提出几点希望。, 一是希望大家积极融入美国主流社会，推动当地经济社会发展。要发扬中华民族勤劳善良的传统美德，通过自身努力实现人生价值。要遵守驻在国法律，尊重当地习俗，同各族裔人民和睦相处，共同发展，为当地经济社会发展贡献智慧和力量。, 二是希望大家发挥学贯中西、融通中美的优势，为中美互利合作牵线搭桥。要抓住中国经济发展的机遇，利用自身资金、技术、管理、人脉等有利条件，促进中美各领域务实交流合作，为中美关系增加正能量，为中美友谊的大厦添砖加瓦。, 三是希望大家积极主动宣介中华文化，讲好中国故事。每一位旅美侨胞都是中华文化的使者，希望你们身体力行展示中华文化魅力，介绍一个真实的中国，增进美国人民对中国的了解，促进中美两国人民友谊，夯实中美关系民意基础。, “悠悠天宇旷，切切故乡情。”欢迎大家常回家看看。我们这次来美国，给大家带来一些家乡的月饼，这是祖国人民的一点心意。, 最后，祝大家中秋愉快、身体健康、阖家幸福！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社美国西雅图9月23日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年09月25日 02 版）, ]",习近平在西雅图出席侨界举行的欢迎招待会时的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27632208
16,76,"[, Dear Governor Brown, California, Dear Governor Insley, Washington, Dear Governor Branstad, Iowa, Dear Governor Snyder, Michigan, Dear Governor Brown, Oregon ,, Responsible comrades of Chinese provinces and cities,, Ladies and gentlemen, friends:, It is a pleasure to attend the third China-US Governors Forum. First of all, I express my warm congratulations on the success of the forum! I highly appreciate the proactive efforts made by the responsible persons of the provinces and states to promote the development of Sino-US relations for a long time! , Just now, I listened to your speech carefully, and everyone spoke very well. Every time I communicate with local leaders in China and the United States, I am very inspired. In 2012, when I visited the United States, I attended the meeting between the governors of the Central American Province in Los Angeles. In 2013, I met representatives from both parties who participated in the second provincial governor forum in Beijing. Everyone talked about local cooperation and offered suggestions for the development of relations between the two countries. I have worked in the local area for a long time. I know the importance of local leaders’ responsibilities and hard work. I also know that local cooperation plays an important role in the development of national relations. In the final analysis, state-to-state relations require the support of the people and ultimately serve the people. The place is closest to the people. Whether local cooperation is good or not depends on whether the cooperation at the national level can take root. For this reason, I have always attached great importance to Sino-US local cooperation. Over the past 30 years, the development of Sino-US relations has benefited from the support of the localities and peoples of the two countries. In the future, we still have to rely on and benefit localities. , I am glad to see that in recent years, China-US local exchanges and cooperation have shown a new trend of vigorous development. China’s 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have established 43 pairs of friendly provinces and states and 200 pairs of friendly cities with 50 US states. Over the past 10 years, 42 US states' exports to China have increased by three digits. According to US statistics, China has invested more than US$8 billion annually in the past five years, and the growth rate is still accelerating. The five states in the United States that come today, China are your top four export markets and the main source of foreign students. Among the six provinces and cities in China that participated in the conference, some took the United States as the largest trading partner, and some attracted thousands of U.S. companies to invest. In one year, the trade volume with the United States increased by more than 40%. These exchanges and cooperation have benefited the two peoples. At present, China-US relations have generally maintained stable development, and pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been comprehensively deepened. I am here this time and hope to have in-depth exchanges with President Obama and all sectors of the American society and plan a blueprint for the development of relations between the two countries. From an international perspective, economic globalization continues to develop in depth, new breakthroughs are brewing in industrial upgrading, and various production factors are accelerating in the world. Under the above background, there is a broader world for local exchanges and cooperation between the two countries. , First of all, the two sides should make effective use of the opportunities brought about by the huge economies of the two countries. Scale is business opportunity. China and the United States have the status of the top two economies in the world, which is itself a huge treasure for cooperation between provinces and states. As the world's largest economy, the United States has a vast market space and is extremely capable of absorbing external commodities, investment, and talents. From the perspective of China, we have a population of more than 1.3 billion. The populations of Shandong and Sichuan are close to 100 million. The total population of the six provinces and cities here is equivalent to the total population of the United States. We are vigorously promoting new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, and implementing innovation-driven development strategies. This process will generate massive demand for external commodities, technologies, and services. In the next five years, China is expected to import US$10 trillion in commodities, foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and the number of outbound tourists will exceed 500 million. We welcome US states to strengthen cooperation with China. Second, the two sides should share the favorable policies of reform and development between China and the United States. Change is the trend of today's world. China will continue to reform and open up unswervingly, and various areas of China are exploring reform and opening up in various fields. The United States has made efforts to adjust its economic structure, adopted policies such as ""re-industrialization"" and manufacturing return, and formulated many strategic plans to encourage technological innovation and industrial upgrading to promote sustained economic recovery. Some states have introduced a number of ways to attract investment, and the conditions are even more favorable than ours in the 1980s. This will create opportunities for cooperation. We encourage more Chinese places to go to the United States to carry out higher-level exchanges and cooperation to achieve our own development and further benefit local society. , China is formulating economic and social development plans for the ""13th Five-Year Plan"" period. We will strive to implement a new round of high-level opening to the outside world and accelerate the establishment of a new open economic system. In this regard, we encourage some qualified areas to try first. For example, we set up four free trade pilot zones in Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian, and adopted a pre-entry national treatment plus negative list management model; launched six services in finance, tourism, and medical care in BeijingSet up four free trade pilot zones and adopt the management model of pre-access national treatment plus a negative list; conduct pilot projects in Beijing to open foreign investment in six service sectors including finance, tourism, and medical services, etc. We will take effective measures to promote the coordinated development of domestic regions, coordinated development of urban and rural areas, and accelerate the development of less developed regions. We will accelerate the construction of the “Belt and Road” and build a platform for expanding domestic cooperation in various regions of the country. For example, Xinjiang is the ""core area"" of the Silk Road Economic Belt, and Yunnan is the ""bridgehead"" of the ""Belt and Road"" opening to the southwest. The “Belt and Road” initiative welcomes the active participation of all countries in the world, including the United States. These measures will create opportunities for Sino-US local cooperation. Thirdly, both sides should work hard to explore the potential of complementarity between China and the United States. Exerting advantages is the key to successful cooperation. Each of China and the United States has unique characteristics in its superior areas and is highly complementary. Both sides should adapt to local conditions, ""Eight immortals cross the sea, each showing their magical powers."" For example, Iowa is known as the “American Granary”, and Oregon is also an important agricultural area in the United States. It can strengthen cooperation with major agricultural provinces such as Shaanxi, Hebei, and Heilongjiang. Hewlett-Packard of California has established a global computer production base in Chongqing, and both parties can deepen cooperation around the information industry. Michigan is the largest producer of motor vehicles in the United States. The six provinces and cities in which China is present are actively developing the automobile industry. The two sides can discuss more cooperative projects. Both parties can also actively explore and open up third-party markets. , China is vigorously promoting the construction of ecological civilization. This is also a key direction of our ""13th Five-Year Plan"". Roughly calculated, our annual investment in environmental protection has been close to US$200 billion per year, and environmental protection investment in various regions has been growing rapidly. In this regard, China has needs and markets, and the United States has technology and experience. Washington State has advantages in environmental protection and coastal protection, and can strengthen cooperation with some major provinces or coastal provinces that invest in environmental protection in China. The first China-U.S. Climate Smart/Low-Carbon City Summit held in Los Angeles not long ago has also been very effective. Many local provinces and states have taken the lead in national emission reduction goals and played a leading role. Such efforts deserve recognition and encouragement. The exchange and cooperation in the field of environmental protection between the two countries should become an important aspect of the joint efforts of China and the United States to respond to climate change and promote sustainable development. , I attach great importance to Sino-American cultural exchanges. ""Relatives are getting closer and closer, and friends are getting closer and closer."" The more frequent the people's exchanges between China and the United States, the stronger the foundation for friendship between the two countries, and the more prosperous the cooperation will be. Provinces and states should conduct exchanges and cooperation in a wide range of fields such as education, tourism, sports, and youth, and support all walks of life and people from all walks of life. , Employment is a matter of great concern to the governors of all provinces. We must carry out these cooperations to promote growth, create employment, and benefit the people. Every province or city in China today has dozens or hundreds of colleges and universities, and some provinces have more than one million students. In 2006, when I was working in Zhejiang, I attended the signing ceremony of Wenzhou University and Kane University co-founding Wenzhou Kean University. After years of hard work, Wenzhou Kenn University was formally established last year and is currently functioning well. There are also nearly 100 primary and secondary schools in Zhejiang Province that have sister relationships with schools across the United States and have active contacts. Both sides should explore various forms of educational cooperation and jointly cultivate future-oriented high-quality talents. China will fund a total of 50,000 international students from the two countries to study in the other country in the next three years. The United States will also strive to achieve millions of American students to learn Chinese by 2020. The two countries will hold a tourism year in 2016. These measures will provide more platforms for the two provinces and states to strengthen cultural exchanges. I hope everyone will work together to build a wider and stronger bridge of Sino-US folk friendship. , The Chinese often say ""just fight for the day and night."" Westerners pay attention to ""take advantage of opportunities when acting."" It is the right time for China-US local cooperation. I hope you will actively promote the two provinces and states to seize the opportunity and take advantage of the momentum to jointly write a new chapter of Sino-US local cooperation. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Seattle, United States, September 22nd), ""People's Daily"" (September 24, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the China-US Governors Forum,2746,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-09-24,"[, 尊敬的加利福尼亚州布朗州长，, 尊敬的华盛顿州英斯利州长，, 尊敬的艾奥瓦州布兰斯塔德州长，, 尊敬的密歇根州斯奈德州长，, 尊敬的俄勒冈州布朗州长，, 中方各位省市负责同志，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴出席第三届中美省州长论坛。首先，我对论坛的成功举办，表示热烈的祝贺！对各位省州负责人长期以来为促进中美关系发展作出的积极努力，表示高度的赞赏！, 刚才，我认真听了你们的发言，大家讲得都很好。每次同中美地方负责人交流，我都很受启发。2012年，我访美时曾在洛杉矶出席中美省州长见面会。2013年，我在北京会见了参加第二届省州长论坛的双方代表。大家畅谈地方合作，为发展两国关系献计献策，我至今记忆犹新。, 我曾长期在地方工作，深知地方领导责任之重、工作之不易，也深知地方合作对发展国家关系有着重要作用。国与国关系归根结底需要人民支持，最终也服务于人民。地方是最贴近老百姓的。地方合作搞得好不好，关系国家层面的合作能否落地生根。为此，我一直高度重视中美地方合作。过去30多年，中美关系发展得益于两国地方和人民支持，未来仍然要依靠地方、造福地方。, 我高兴地看到，近年来，中美地方交流合作呈现新的蓬勃发展态势。中国31个省区市同美国50个州建立了43对友好省州、200对友好城市。过去10年，美国42个州对华出口增幅达到3位数。据美方统计，中国过去5年对美投资年均超过80多亿美元，增速还在加快。今天来的美国5个州，中国都是你们位列前四位的出口市场和主要留学生来源国。与会的中国6个省市，有的以美国为第一大贸易伙伴，有的吸引数以千计的美国企业投资，有的一年对美国贸易额增幅就超过40%。这些交流合作造福了两国人民。, 当前，中美关系总体保持稳定发展，各领域务实合作全面深化。我这次来，希望同奥巴马总统和美国社会各界深入交流，规划两国关系发展蓝图。从国际上看，经济全球化继续深入发展，产业升级酝酿新突破，各种生产要素在世界范围内加快流动。在上述背景下，两国地方交流合作有着更加广阔的天地。, 首先，双方要有效利用中美两国经济巨大体量带来的机遇。规模就是商机。中美坐拥世界前两大经济体地位，这本身就是省州开展合作的巨大宝藏。美国作为世界第一大经济体，拥有广大的市场空间，吸纳外部商品、投资、人才的能力极强。从中国看，我们有13亿多人口，山东、四川两省人口都接近一个亿，在座6省市人口加起来相当于全美国人口的总数。我们正在大力推进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化，实施创新驱动发展战略，这一进程将对外部商品、技术、服务产生海量需求。未来5年，预计中国将进口10万亿美元商品，对外投资将超过5000亿美元，出境旅游人数将超过5亿人次。我们欢迎美国各州同中国地方加强合作。, 第二，双方要共同分享中美两国改革发展的政策利好。变革是当今世界的潮流。中国将坚定不移继续改革开放，中国各地正在进行各方面改革开放的探索。美国努力调整经济结构，采取“再工业化”、制造业回流等政策，制定了很多鼓励科技创新、产业升级的战略规划，推动经济持续复苏。一些州出台了不少招商引资的办法，条件甚至比我们上世纪80年代还优惠。这都会创造合作机遇。我们鼓励更多中国地方到美国开展更高水平的交流合作，实现自身发展，也进一步造福当地社会。, 中国正在制定“十三五”时期经济社会发展规划。我们将着力实行新一轮高水平对外开放，加快建立开放型经济新体制。这方面，我们鼓励一些有条件的地区先行先试。比如，我们在上海、广东、天津、福建设立4个自由贸易试验区，采取准入前国民待遇加负面清单的管理模式；在北京市开展金融、旅游、医疗等6个服务业领域对外资开放试点，等等。我们将采取有力措施促进国内区域协调发展、城乡协调发展，加快欠发达地区发展。我们将加快推进“一带一路”建设，为国内各地区拓展对外合作搭建平台。比如，新疆是丝绸之路经济带“核心区域”，云南是“一带一路”向西南开放的“桥头堡”。“一带一路”欢迎包括美国在内的世界各国积极参与。这些措施将为中美地方合作创造机遇。, 第三，双方要努力发掘中美地方优势互补的潜能。发挥优势是合作成功的关键。中美各地优势领域各具特色，互补性很强。双方应该因地制宜，“八仙过海，各显神通”。比如，艾奥瓦州有“美国粮仓”之称，俄勒冈州也是美国的重要农业区，可以同陕西、河北、黑龙江等中国农业大省加强合作。加利福尼亚州的惠普公司在重庆建有全球电脑生产基地，双方可以围绕信息产业深化合作。密歇根州是美国最大的机动车生产地，中方在座的六省市都在积极发展汽车工业，双方可以探讨开展更多合作项目。双方还可以积极探索开辟第三方市场。, 中国正在大力推进生态文明建设。这也是我们“十三五”规划的一个重点方向。粗略计算，我们这些年每年环保投入近2000亿美元，各地环保投入都在快速增长。这方面中国有需要、有市场，美国有技术、有经验。华盛顿州在环保、海岸带保护等方面有优势，就可以同中国一些环保投入大省或沿海省份加强合作。前不久在洛杉矶举办的首届中美气候智慧型/低碳城市峰会效果也很好，很多地方省州减排目标走在了国家目标的前头，发挥着率先引领作用。这种努力值得肯定和鼓励。两国地方环保领域交流合作理应成为中美合力应对气候变化、推进可持续发展的一个重要方面。, 我高度重视中美人文交流。“亲戚越走越近，朋友越走越亲。”中美民众往来越频繁，两国友好的基础就越坚实，务实合作就越红火。各省州应该在教育、旅游、体育、青年等广泛领域开展交流合作，支持社会各界和民众多走动、常来往。, 就业是各位省州长高度关注的问题，我们要通过开展这些合作，促进增长，创造就业，使人民受益。, 今天来的中国省市，每家都有几十、上百所高等院校，有的省在校生数量超过百万。2006年，我在浙江工作时，出席了温州大学和美国肯恩大学合作创办温州肯恩大学的签字仪式。经过多年努力，温州肯恩大学去年正式设立，目前运转良好。浙江省还有近百所中小学同美国各地学校结成姐妹关系，往来活跃。双方应该探索形式多样的教育合作，共同培养面向未来的高素质人才。中方将在未来3年内资助两国共5万名留学生到对方国家学习，美国也将努力在2020年前实现百万名美国学生学中文，两国将在2016年举办旅游年。这些举措将为两国各省州加强人文交流提供更多平台。希望大家一道努力，把中美民间友好的桥梁筑得更宽、更牢。, 中国人常说“只争朝夕”。西方人则讲究“行事要趁机会好”。中美地方合作正当其时。希望各位积极推动两国各省州抓住机遇、乘势而上，共同谱写中美地方合作新篇章。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社美国西雅图9月22日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年09月24日 02 版）, ]",习近平在中美省州长论坛上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27626928
17,77,"[, Dear President Putin, Dear Prime Minister Modi, Dear President Zuma, Dear President Rousseff, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends:, Glad to be with you again in beautiful Ufa meeting. Thank you President Putin and the Russian government for their thoughtful arrangements. This Ufa meeting is the BRICS leaders' meeting that came to Russia again six years after the meeting, and is of great significance to the BRICS cooperation process. Over the past six years, BRICS cooperation has gone through an extraordinary course. , ——We uphold international fairness and justice and promote the democratization of international relations. On many major international and regional issues, we stand together from the standpoint of emerging market countries and developing countries, calling for compliance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law and international relations. Basic guidelines for peaceful settlement of international disputes through political and diplomatic means. -We promote world economic growth, improve global economic governance, strengthen the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries in international economic and financial affairs, and enable traditional international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to obtain new Progress made new energy. , ——We expand the cooperation field from scratch, from small to large, covering many fields such as politics, economy, finance, trade, society, humanities, etc., forming a multi-level and all-round cooperation structure. The preparation for the establishment of the BRICS New Development Bank is in full swing, and the emergency reserve arrangement is officially launched, which fully proves the effectiveness and action of the BRICS cooperation. At present, the world economy is still in a period of deep adjustment after the international financial crisis, and unstable and uncertain factors have increased. The risks and challenges of emerging market countries and developing countries are constantly gathering, the economic growth rate is generally slowing down, and the development of BRICS countries is also facing many difficulties and challenges. , The more difficult it is, the more confidence you must have. It should be noted that any progress is not linear, and there are twists and turns. Despite these difficulties, the BRICS countries have abundant natural and human resources, a broad domestic market, huge development potential, and ample policy space. The upward trend will not change. , Colleagues! At present, the international situation is complicated and the opportunities and challenges of the BRICS countries coexist. We should strengthen cooperation, go hand in hand, and continue to be a leader in promoting global development. Last year in Fortaleza, Brazil, we unanimously decided to deepen the BRICS partnership in a spirit of openness, tolerance, cooperation and mutual benefit. This year’s host country, Russia, also adopted the “BRICS Partnership” as the theme of the meeting, indicating that this concept has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Now, I would like to make a few comments on strengthening the BRICS partnership. First, build a partnership to maintain world peace. At present, the trend of the era of peaceful development is stronger, but the world is still very uneven. Partial turbulence is one after another, and non-traditional security challenges such as terrorism, drug threats, major epidemics, and natural disasters are endless. The BRICS countries should advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security concept, coordinate actions, support each other, and work together to address these global issues. We must jointly prevent and combat all forms of terrorism and cooperate in the areas of counter-terrorism experience exchange, intelligence sharing, clue verification, and law enforcement cooperation. China supports accelerating the institutionalization of drug control cooperation among BRICS countries, and will work with other member states to promote regional and global drug problems. , Forgetting history means betrayal. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. The BRICS countries should work with all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to resolutely oppose denials, distortions and tampering with the plots and actions of the history of World War II, and jointly safeguard the victory of World War II and international fairness and justice. At the same time, we should use history as a mirror, abandon the Cold War mentality, reject the zero-sum game, and jointly maintain regional and world peace and stability. , We must continue to work to promote the democratization of international relations. Frequent sanctions or threats of sanctions in international relations will not help solve the problem. It is necessary to advocate peaceful and political resolution of differences through dialogue and negotiation. Second, build partnerships that promote common development. For the BRICS cooperation to flourish, it is necessary to strengthen the foundation and build a community of BRICS interests. With the goal of building a value chain for benefit sharing and a large market where benefits are integrated, we should jointly build a closer economic partnership, give play to the complementary advantages of member countries in terms of resource endowments and industrial structure, and work together to expand more room for development. It is necessary to advance the construction of the headquarters of the New Development Bank of the BRICS and the regional center in Africa, and strive to put into operation as soon as possible and obtain early gains. Implement the BRICS economic partnership strategy and explore new cooperation highlights. , We must continue to work to promote the common development and prosperity of developing countries. This year is internationalMake good use of BRICS economic partnership strategies and discover new highlights of cooperation. , We must continue to work to promote the common development and prosperity of developing countries. This year is the International Year of Development and the year of climate change. The BRICS countries should strengthen coordination and cooperation to safeguard the common interests of emerging market countries and developing countries on major international development issues such as the post-2015 development agenda and climate change, and guide post-2015 The Development Agenda negotiations focused on solving the difficulties and challenges facing developing countries, especially African countries and LDCs. , Third, build a partnership that promotes multiple civilizations. The success of the BRICS cooperation fully proves that different social systems can tolerate each other, different development models can cooperate with each other, and different values ​​and cultures can communicate with each other. We must adhere to openness and tolerance, learn from each other's strengths in exchanges and learn from each other, and advance together while seeking common ground while reserving differences. The BRICS countries are located on four continents and across the northern and southern hemispheres. They have a unique geographical advantage. We must make good use of this advantage to actively carry out dialogue and exchanges with other countries and international organizations to share the results of cooperation. We must strengthen unity and cooperation with other emerging market countries and developing countries, continue to strengthen our strength, and expand the representativeness and influence of the BRICS countries. , Fourth, build a partnership to strengthen global economic governance. International economic rules need to be constantly reformed to adapt to new changes in the global growth pattern and to match responsibilities and capabilities. We must work together to improve the status and role of the BRICS countries in the global governance system and promote the international economic order to conform to the historical trend of rising power in emerging market countries and developing countries. Promote the reform of the governance structure of the International Monetary Fund, increase the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. Advocate the construction of an open world economy, support the multilateral trading system, promote the Doha Round negotiations to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of emerging market countries and developing countries, and ensure that countries have equal opportunities, rules and rights in international economic and trade activities. The BRICS countries should strengthen cooperation in information security and Internet management, jointly build a peaceful, secure, open, and cooperative cyberspace, and strive for equal rights to participate in Internet governance. The immigration issue is closely related to the economic development and social stability of the BRICS countries. We should also strengthen exchanges and cooperation in this field. , Colleagues! As I just mentioned, our respective countries face new opportunities and challenges in their development. The BRIC countries have similar stages of development, and the opportunities and challenges they face are also similar. We should strengthen the exchange of experience in governing the country, enhance mutual understanding, strengthen learning and reference, and jointly explore solutions to problems. At present, China is coordinating and advancing the building of a well-off society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepening reforms, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly, and has planned strategic goals and strategic measures to govern the country under the new situation. , Building a well-off society in an all-round way is our strategic goal at this stage, and also a key step in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We will continue to focus on economic construction, and strive to build a moderately prosperous society in which the fruits of reform and development will truly benefit the people, and the economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization will develop in an all-round way. We will unswervingly deepen reforms, advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, and promote sustained and healthy economic and social development. We will adhere to the common advancement of governing the country by law, ruling by law, and administration by law, uphold the integration of the rule of law, the rule of law, and the society of the rule of law, and achieve scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and law enforcement by all people. We will comprehensively promote the Chinese Communist Party's self-improvement, improve the Party's self-improvement, self-innovation, and self-improvement capabilities, maintain a high-pressure trend of zero tolerance for corruption, improve system and mechanism construction, and continuously enhance the ability to govern. , Colleagues! , Our efforts today are related to the well-being of the people of the 3 billion BRIC countries, but also to the future and future of the entire world and all mankind. There is a proverb in Russia: ""The road to success is always bumpy."" Let us embark on a journey to join hands in building a closer partnership among the BRICS countries and jointly create a better future for the BRICS countries! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Ufa, Russia, July 9th), ""People's Daily"" (July 10, 2015, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Speech at the seventh meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries,2850,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-07-10,"[, 尊敬的普京总统，, 尊敬的莫迪总理，, 尊敬的祖马总统，, 尊敬的罗塞夫总统，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　很高兴在美丽的乌法同大家再次会晤。感谢普京总统和俄罗斯政府所做的周到安排。, 　　这次乌法会晤是金砖国家领导人会晤时隔6年再次来到俄罗斯，对金砖国家合作进程具有重要意义。6年来，金砖国家合作走过了一段不平凡的历程。, 　　——我们秉持国际公平正义，推动国际关系民主化，在许多重大国际和地区问题上，站在新兴市场国家和发展中国家的立场共同发声，呼吁遵守联合国宪章宗旨和原则以及国际法和国际关系基本准则，通过政治和外交手段和平解决国际争端。, 　　——我们推动世界经济增长，完善全球经济治理，加强新兴市场国家和发展中国家在国际经济金融事务中的代表性和话语权，让世界银行、国际货币基金组织等传统国际金融机构取得新进展，焕发新活力。, 　　——我们拓展合作领域，从无到有，从小到大，涵盖政治、经济、金融、贸易、社会、人文等多个领域，形成多层次、全方位合作架构。金砖国家新开发银行筹建工作全面展开，应急储备安排正式启动，充分证明了金砖国家合作的有效性和行动力。, 　　当前，世界经济仍然处于国际金融危机后的深度调整期，不稳定不确定因素增多。新兴市场国家和发展中国家风险和挑战不断集聚，经济增速普遍放缓，金砖国家各国发展也面临不少困难和挑战。, 　　越是在困难的时候，越要坚定信心。应该看到，任何进步都不是直线的，有曲折也有反复。尽管会有这样那样的困难，但金砖国家拥有丰富自然和人力资源、广阔国内市场、巨大发展潜力、充裕政策空间，上升趋势不会改变。, 　　各位同事！, 　　当前，国际形势错综复杂，金砖国家机遇和挑战并存，我们应该加强合作、携手并进，继续做推动全球发展的领跑者。去年在巴西福塔莱萨，我们一致决定本着开放、包容、合作、共赢精神，深化金砖国家伙伴关系。今年的东道国俄罗斯也将“金砖国家伙伴关系”作为会晤主题，说明这一理念已经深入人心。, 　　下面，我愿就加强金砖国家伙伴关系谈几点看法。, 　　第一，构建维护世界和平的伙伴关系。当前，和平发展的时代潮流更加强劲，但世界仍然很不太平，局部动荡此起彼伏，恐怖主义、毒品威胁、重大疫情、自然灾害等非传统安全挑战层出不穷。金砖国家应该倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，协调行动，相互支援，携手应对这些全球性问题。我们要共同防范和打击一切形式的恐怖主义，在反恐经验交流、情报分享、线索核查、执法合作等领域开展合作。中方支持加快金砖国家禁毒合作机制化进程，将同其他成员国携手推动解决地区和全球毒品问题。, 　　忘记历史就意味着背叛。今年是世界反法西斯战争胜利暨联合国成立70周年。金砖国家应该同世界上所有热爱和平的国家和人民一道，坚决反对否认、歪曲、篡改第二次世界大战历史的图谋和行径，共同维护第二次世界大战胜利成果和国际公平正义。同时，要以史为鉴，摒弃冷战思维，拒绝零和博弈，共同维护地区和世界和平稳定。, 　　我们要继续致力于推动国际关系民主化。在国际关系中动辄制裁或以制裁相威胁，无助于解决问题。要倡导通过对话和谈判，以和平和政治方式解决分歧。, 　　第二，构建促进共同发展的伙伴关系。金砖国家合作事业要繁荣昌盛，就要强本固基，打造金砖国家利益共同体。我们要以建设利益共享的价值链和利益融合的大市场为目标，共同构建更紧密经济伙伴关系，发挥各成员国在资源禀赋、产业结构上的互补优势，合力拓展更大发展空间。要同步推进金砖国家新开发银行总部和非洲区域中心建设，争取尽早投入运作，取得早期收获。落实好金砖国家经济伙伴战略，发掘新的合作亮点。, 　　我们要继续致力于促进发展中国家共同发展繁荣。今年是国际发展年和气候变化年，金砖国家应该加强协调和配合，在2015年后发展议程、气候变化等重大国际发展议题上，维护新兴市场国家和发展中国家共同利益，引导2015年后发展议程谈判重点关注解决发展中国家特别是非洲国家和最不发达国家面临的困难和挑战。, 　　第三，构建弘扬多元文明的伙伴关系。金砖国家合作的成功充分证明，不同社会制度可以相互包容，不同发展模式可以相互合作，不同价值文化可以相互交流。我们要坚持开放包容，在交流互鉴中取长补短，在求同存异中共同前进。, 　　金砖国家分处四大洲、地跨南北半球，具有独特地理优势，我们要利用好这一优势，积极开展同其他国家和国际组织对话和交流，分享合作成果。要加强同其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家团结合作，不断壮大我们的力量，扩大金砖国家代表性和影响力。, 　　第四，构建加强全球经济治理的伙伴关系。国际经济规则需要不断革故鼎新，以适应全球增长格局新变化，让责任和能力相匹配。我们要共同致力于提高金砖国家在全球治理体系中的地位和作用，推动国际经济秩序顺应新兴市场国家和发展中国家力量上升的历史趋势。推动改革国际货币基金组织治理结构，增加新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权。倡导建设开放型世界经济，支持多边贸易体制，推动多哈回合谈判维护新兴市场国家和发展中国家的正当权益，确保各国在国际经贸活动中机会平等、规则平等、权利平等。, 　　金砖国家要加强在信息安全和互联网管理方面合作，共同构建和平、安全、开放、合作的网络空间，争取平等参与互联网治理权利。移民问题同金砖各国经济发展和社会稳定密切相关，我们也应该加强这一领域交流合作。, 　　各位同事！, 　　正如我刚才提到的，我们各自国家发展都面临新的机遇和挑战。金砖国家发展阶段相似，所面临的机遇和挑战也有一定相通之处。我们应该加强治国理政经验交流，增进彼此了解，加强学习借鉴，共同探索解决问题的办法。, 　　当前，中国正在协调推进全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党，规划了在新形势下治国理政的战略目标和战略举措。, 　　全面建成小康社会是我们现阶段战略目标，也是实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦关键一步。我们将继续坚持以经济建设为中心，致力于建设改革发展成果真正惠及人民，经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明全面发展的小康社会。我们将坚定不移深化改革，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，推动经济社会持续健康发展。我们将坚持依法治国、依法执政、依法行政共同推进，坚持法治国家、法治政府、法治社会一体建设，实现科学立法、严格执法、公正司法、全民守法。我们将全面推进中国共产党自身建设，提高党的自我完善、自我革新、自我提高能力，保持对腐败零容忍的高压态势，完善体制机制建设，不断增强执政能力。, 　　各位同事！, 　　我们今天的努力，关系30亿金砖国家人民的福祉，也关系整个世界和全人类的前途和未来。俄罗斯有句谚语：“通向成功的道路永远都是曲折坎坷的。”让我们踏上征程，携手建设金砖国家更紧密的伙伴关系，共同开创金砖国家更美好未来！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社俄罗斯乌法7月9日电）, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2015年07月10日 03 版）, ]",习近平：在金砖国家领导人第七次会晤上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27281888
18,78,"[, Dear guests and friends: Hello everyone! More than 2,000 years ago, Confucius, a great thinker in China, said that it would be great to have friends come from afar. Today, more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Japan came from afar to gather in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to hold the China-Japan Friendly Exchange Conference together with China. This is a great event for non-governmental exchanges between the two countries in recent years, and it also makes us very happy. , First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I warmly welcome all Japanese friends to visit! Through you, I would also like to extend my sincere regards and best wishes to the Japanese people! China and Japan have been brought under water. For more than 2000 years, peace and friendship have been the main theme in the hearts of the two peoples. The two peoples have learned from each other, promoted their respective developments, and made important contributions to the progress of human civilization. , More than a week ago, Indian Prime Minister Mr. Modi visited my hometown of Shaanxi Province, and I traced the history of ancient cultural exchanges between China and India in Xi'an with him. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Xi'an was also an important gateway for Sino-Japanese friendly exchanges. Many envoys, foreign students, and monks from Japan studied and lived there. The representative of them, Abe Nakamaro, formed a profound friendship with Li Tang and Wang Wei, the great poets of the Tang Dynasty in China, and left a touching story. , When I was working in Fujian Province, I knew the story of the 17th-century Chinese monk Yinyuan Master traveling to Japan. During his time in Japan, Master Yin Yuan not only spread Buddhist sutras, but also brought advanced culture and science and technology, which had an important impact on the economic and social development of Japan during the Edo period. In 2009, when I visited Japan, I visited Kitakyushu and other places, and directly experienced the continuous cultural origins and historical connections between the people of both countries. After modern times, as Japan embarked on the path of foreign aggression and expansion, China and Japan have experienced a painful history, which has caused a profound disaster to the Chinese people. In the 1970s, Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Tanaka Kakuei, Mr. Daping Zhengfang and other leaders of the older generation of the two countries, with a high degree of political wisdom, made important political decisions, overcome many difficulties, and achieved diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Normalization and the conclusion of peace and friendship treaties opened a new era of relations between the two countries. A group of people of insight, such as Mr. Liao Chengzhi, Mr. Gao Jieda Zhisuke, Mr. Okazaki Kaheita, etc., ran actively and did a lot of work. History has proved that the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship is beneficial to the two countries and peoples, and to Asia and the world. It deserves our cherishment and careful maintenance, and we will continue to make unremitting efforts. , Guests and friends! , Neighbors can choose, but neighboring countries cannot. ""Germany is not alone, there must be neighbors."" As long as the people of China and Japan are sincere and friendly, with virtue as their neighbors, they will surely achieve friendship from generation to generation. Both China and Japan are important countries in Asia and the world. The people of the two countries are hardworking, kind, and wise. Peace, friendship and cooperation between China and Japan is the trend of the people and the general trend. China attaches great importance to the development of Sino-Japanese relations. Although Sino-Japanese relations have gone through ups and downs, China’s basic policy has not changed and will not change in the future. We are willing to work with Japan to promote good-neighborly and friendly cooperation between the two countries on the basis of four political documents between China and Japan. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War. At that time, the crime of aggression committed by Japanese militarism could not be covered up, and the historical truth could not be distorted. The Chinese people and the people of the victimized countries of Asia will not agree to any words and deeds that attempt to distort and beautify the history of Japanese militarism, and I believe that the Japanese people with justice and conscience will not agree. Past experience guide for the future. Remembering history is to create the future; never forgetting war is to maintain peace. , We believe that the Japanese people were also the victims of that war. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people complained with virtue, helped millions of Japanese return to their homes, and raised thousands of Japanese orphans in the war to bring them up, demonstrating the Chinese people’s broad-mindedness and boundless love. Today, both China and Japan should, in the spirit of taking history as a mirror and facing the future, jointly promote peace and development, seek common friendship from generation to generation, and jointly create a better future for the development of the two countries, and contribute to peace in Asia and the world. , Guests and friends! The foundation of Sino-Japanese friendship lies in the people, and the future of Sino-Japanese relations lies in the hands of the two peoples. The more irregular the development of relations between the two countries, the more active the people from all walks of life in the two countries are required, and the greater the need for the two sides to strengthen non-governmental exchanges and create conditions and environments for the improvement of the development of bilateral relations. , ""Youth prosperity is national prosperity."" There are many young friends here today. The Chinese government supports non-governmental exchanges between the two countries and encourages people from all walks of life in the two countries, especially the younger generation, to actively join in the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship, enhance understanding, establish mutual trust, and develop friendship in exchanges and cooperation. , The predecessors planted trees, the descendants took the cool. I sincerely look forward to the two countriesEngage in the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship, enhance understanding, build mutual trust, and develop friendship in exchanges and cooperation. , The predecessors planted trees, the descendants took the cool.

19,79,"[, On May 8th, on the eve of a state visit to Belarus, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Belarusian ""Soviet Belarusian Newspaper"" entitled ""Let the Movement of China-Belarus Friendship and Cooperation Excite"". The article is as follows: Let the movement of Sino-Belarusian friendship and cooperation be in full swing. President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, five years ago, I visited Belarus for the first time in a country known as the ""land of thousands of lakes"". The beautiful scenery and friendly people left a deep impression on me. Today, five years later, with friendly feelings towards the people of Belarus, I will soon set foot on this beautiful land again for my first state visit to Belarus since I assumed the presidency of the People’s Republic of China. Today’s Belarus maintains political stability, sustained economic development, social stability and solidarity, people’s lives are becoming richer, and its international status is constantly improving. President Lukashenko is leading the industrious and wise Belarusian people to continuously achieve new glories in the great journey of national construction. As a good friend of the Belarusian people, I am very happy for this. There is a famous saying in Belarus: ""Friendship and brotherhood trump all wealth."" Both the Chinese people and the Belarusian people have a strong sense of sentiment, and they have brotherhood formed by blood in the world anti-fascist war 70 years ago. In the world war of justice over evil and light over darkness, the Chinese people’s anti-Japanese war broke out the earliest and lasted the longest. The Belarusian people fired the first shot against the German fascist aggression in the Great Patriotic War. The people of China and Belarus fought against the enemy and fought side by side. They made great sacrifices for the final victory of the world anti-fascist war and made great contributions to the history. In the Nazi concentration camp in Minsk, Zhu Min, the daughter of Marshal Zhu De, founder of the founding father of New China, and the Belarusian buddies fought against the German fascists. General Tang Duo took the opportunity to participate in the battle to liberate Minsk. Belarusian soldiers of the Soviet Red Army went to China to participate in the air battle against the Japanese invaders and important battles for the liberation of Northeast China. The ""Soviet Heroes"" Lieutenant General Blagoveshchensky Air Force, Lieutenant General Nikolayanko Air Force, I Major General Danovic and others are outstanding representatives among them. In the 23 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Belarus, the bilateral relations have developed greatly. The two countries have established a comprehensive strategic partnership, formulated a five-year plan for the development of China-Belarus relations, and established an intergovernmental cooperation committee. The political mutual trust between the two sides has been increasingly consolidated, mutual support has been continuously strengthened, and cooperation in various fields has been deepened to become veritable friends and partners. China has become the largest trading partner of Belarus in the Asia-Pacific region. The bilateral trade volume has continued to grow, and it rose by 27.3% against the backdrop of the global economic downturn last year. Belarus has become one of the countries with the most extensive large-scale cooperation projects in Europe and Asia. Both sides have carried out dozens of major projects in the fields of communications, transportation, energy, and infrastructure construction, which have produced good economic and social benefits. Among them, the products of Geely Automobile Assembly Factory realized Belarus' ""car dream""; the first Beijing hotel named after the Chinese capital was completed and operated in Minsk to provide services for the Belarusian guests from all over the world; Minsk 2, 5 and Lukomr The successful implementation of power station renovation projects such as Berezov and Belarus has provided electric power support for the development of the economy of Belarus; the three cement production lines built by China for Belarus have greatly improved the level and scale of Belarusian cement production; China provides modern electric locomotives for Belarus In the vast Belarusian plain; the Sino-Belarus Industrial Park project, which bears the common dream of the two countries' development and revitalization, is gradually starting substantial progress. , Belarus has now opened three Confucius Institutes, and the cultural day activities held by the two sides have become cultural events of the two countries. Last year, 200 teenagers from the disaster area of ​​the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Belarus went to China to convalesce, and they have increased mutual understanding and formed deep friendship with Chinese children. , China-Belarus relations have achieved today thanks to the fact that the two sides have always viewed the development of bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, thanks to their firm support for each other to follow the development path of their own national conditions, and close cooperation in international and regional affairs , Thanks to the two sides' adherence to friendship as the starting point and goal of all cooperation. At present, both China and Belarus are at a critical stage of development. China is committed to achieving the goal of ""two hundred years"" and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Belarus is also accelerating economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, and making unremitting efforts to achieve the strategic goals of economic and social development by 2030. The two sides should connect with the strategic vision, build a community of interests and destiny, and strive to move forward on the road to a common dream. Taking this opportunity, I would like to put forward the following suggestions for developing and deepening China-Belarus relationsCreate a community of interests and destiny, and strive to advance on the road to a common dream. Taking this opportunity, I would like to put forward the following suggestions for developing and deepening China-Belarus relations. , ——Enhance political mutual trust and increase mutual support. Supporting each other firmly on issues such as national sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, security, and development interests that involve the core interests and major concerns of both sides is the cornerstone and core content of China-Belarus comprehensive strategic partnership. China is willing to increase mutual support with Belarus, support each other's measures and actions taken to safeguard national interests, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard the fundamental interests of the two countries. ,-Deepen pragmatic cooperation and strengthen the blending of interests China advocates the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt, will share development experience with Belarus, and strive to make its own development better for the Belarusian people. China welcomes Belarus to play its unique geographical advantages and participate in the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt. It will encourage more powerful Chinese enterprises to invest in Belarus and continue to provide Belarus with economic support and assistance within its ability. The two countries should tap the potential for cooperation, enrich the forms of cooperation, broaden the channels of cooperation, enhance the level of cooperation, and constantly strengthen the material foundation of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Belarus. , —— Close humanistic exchanges and strengthen traditional friendship China is willing to set up a Chinese cultural center in Belarus, increase investment in the Confucius Institute, welcome more Belarusian friends to study, do business, and exchange in China. Taking the direct flights between the capitals of the two countries as a good opportunity to encourage more Chinese tourists to visit Belarus, Welcome more Belarusian friends to visit China. China is willing to continue to expand friendly exchanges and cooperation with Belarus in sports, news media, cultural groups, youth organizations, and to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. -Strengthen international cooperation and jointly safeguard the victory of the Second World War and international fairness and justice. The people of China and Belarus, who made great sacrifices in the Second World War, must unswervingly defend the fruits of victory in exchange for blood and life. As a founding member of the United Nations, China and Belarus should strengthen coordination and cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations, and promote the development of the international order and international system in a more just and reasonable direction. The Belarussian people often say: ""A strong friendship is hard to break."" The Chinese people also have a famous saying: ""Able to do the right thing, be as good as a thousand miles, sturdy in glue, strong in gold."" To make it more exciting, this is my expectation for the development of China-Belarus relations. We are willing to work hand in hand with our Belarusian partners and make unremitting efforts to achieve our common goal. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th), ""People's Daily"" (May 01, 2015 version 01),]",Xi Jinping publishes a signed article in the Belarusian media: Let the movement of Sino-Belarusian friendship and cooperation intensify.,2333,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-05-09,"[, 　　5月8日，在对白俄罗斯进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在白俄罗斯《苏维埃白俄罗斯报》发表题为《让中白友好合作的乐章激越昂扬》的署名文章。文章如下：, 　　让中白友好合作的乐章激越昂扬, 　　中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 　　5年前，我第一次访问了白俄罗斯这个素有“万湖之国”美誉的国度。那里美丽的风光、友好的人民给我留下深刻印象。, 　　5年后的今天，带着对白俄罗斯人民的友好感情，我即将再次踏上这片秀丽的土地，进行我担任中华人民共和国主席以来对白俄罗斯的首次国事访问。今天的白俄罗斯，政治保持稳定，经济持续发展，社会安定团结，人民生活日益富足，国际地位不断提升。卢卡申科总统正在带领勤劳智慧的白俄罗斯人民，在国家建设的伟大征程中，不断取得新的辉煌。作为白俄罗斯人民的好朋友，我为此深感高兴。, 　　白俄罗斯有句名言：“友谊和兄弟之情胜过所有的财富。”中国人民和白俄罗斯人民都尚情重义，更有着在70年前世界反法西斯战争中用鲜血凝结而成的兄弟情谊。在那场正义战胜邪恶、光明战胜黑暗的世界大战中，中国人民抗日战争爆发最早、历时最长，白俄罗斯人民则打响了卫国战争中抗击德国法西斯侵略的第一枪。中白两国人民同仇敌忾、并肩作战，为世界反法西斯战争的最后胜利付出了巨大牺牲，作出了彪炳史册的伟大贡献。在明斯克的纳粹集中营里，新中国开国元勋朱德元帅的女儿朱敏曾同白俄罗斯小伙伴共抗德国法西斯，唐铎将军曾驾机参加解放明斯克的战役。苏联红军中白俄罗斯籍将士曾远赴中国参加打击日本侵略者的空战和解放中国东北的重要战役，“苏联英雄”布拉戈维申斯基空军中将、尼古拉延科空军中将、兹达诺维奇少将等就是他们中的杰出代表。, 　　中白建交23年来，双边关系得到长足发展。两国建立了全面战略伙伴关系，制定了中白关系发展5年规划，建立了政府间合作委员会。双方政治互信日益巩固，相互支持不断加强，各领域合作深入开展，成为名副其实的好朋友和好伙伴。中国已经成为白俄罗斯在亚太地区最大的贸易伙伴，双边贸易额持续增长，在去年全球经济不景气背景下逆势上扬27.3%。, 　　白俄罗斯已经成为中国在欧亚地区开展大型合作项目最为广泛的国家之一，双方在通信、交通、能源、基础设施建设等领域执行了数十个重大项目，产生了良好经济和社会效益。其中，吉利汽车组装厂的产品实现了白俄罗斯的“轿车梦”；首座以中国首都命名的北京饭店在明斯克竣工运营，为白俄罗斯四海宾朋提供服务；明斯克2号、5号、卢科姆尔和别列佐夫等电站改造项目成功实施，为白俄罗斯发展经济提供了电力支持；中国为白俄罗斯建造的3条水泥生产线极大提高了白俄罗斯水泥生产水平和规模；中国为白俄罗斯提供的现代化电力机车奔驰在广袤的白俄罗斯平原；承载着两国发展振兴共同梦想的中白工业园项目正逐步开启实质性进展。, 　　白俄罗斯现在已经开办了3所孔子学院，双方互办的文化日活动成为两国文化盛事。去年，白俄罗斯切尔诺贝利核事故灾区200名青少年赴中国疗养，同中国小朋友增进了相互了解，结下了深厚友谊。, 　　中白关系取得今天的成就，得益于双方始终从战略高度和长远角度看待两国关系发展，得益于双方坚定支持彼此走符合本国国情的发展道路，在国际和地区事务中密切相互协作，得益于双方坚持以友谊为一切合作的出发点和落脚点。, 　　当前，中国和白俄罗斯都处在发展的关键阶段。中国致力于实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标，实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。白俄罗斯同样在加快经济结构调整和产业升级，为实现到2030年经济社会发展战略目标而不懈努力。双方应该对接战略构想，打造利益和命运共同体，在共同圆梦的道路上奋力前行。借此机会，我愿提出以下几点发展和深化中白关系的建议。, 　　——增强政治互信，加大相互支持。在国家主权、独立、领土完整、安全、发展利益等涉及双方核心利益和重大关切问题上相互坚定支持，是中白全面战略伙伴关系的基石和核心内容。中方愿同白方加大相互支持力度，支持对方为维护国家利益所采取的措施和行动，支持对方发展振兴，共同维护两国根本利益。, 　　——深化务实合作，加强利益交融。中方倡导建设丝绸之路经济带，将同白方分享发展经验，并努力使自身发展更好惠及白俄罗斯人民。中方欢迎白方发挥得天独厚的区位优势，参与丝绸之路经济带建设，将鼓励更多有实力的中国企业赴白俄罗斯投资兴业，将在力所能及范围内继续给予白方经济支持和援助。两国要挖掘合作潜力，丰富合作形式，拓宽合作渠道，提升合作水平，不断夯实中白全面战略伙伴关系的物质基础。, 　　——密切人文交流，加固传统友谊。中方愿在白俄罗斯设立中国文化中心，加大对孔子学院的投入，欢迎更多白俄罗斯朋友到中国留学、经商、交流，以两国首都开通直航为良好契机，鼓励更多中国游客赴白俄罗斯观光，欢迎更多白俄罗斯朋友来华游览。中方愿同白方不断扩大体育、新闻媒体、文艺团体、青年组织友好交往和合作，加深两国人民的相互了解和友谊。, 　　——加强国际协作，共同维护第二次世界大战胜利成果和国际公平正义。在第二次世界大战中付出了巨大牺牲的中白人民，要坚定不移捍卫用鲜血和生命换来的胜利果实。中白作为联合国创始会员国，要加强在联合国和其他国际组织中的协调和配合，推动国际秩序和国际体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。, 　　白俄罗斯人民常说：“牢固的友谊利斧难破。”中国人民也有句名言：“交得其道，千里同好，固于胶漆，坚于金石。”奏响中白友好合作的乐章，使之更加激越昂扬，这是我对中白关系发展的期待。我们愿同白方伙伴携手并肩，为实现我们共同的目标而不懈努力。,     （新华社北京5月8日电）, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2015年05月09日 01 版）, ]",习近平在白俄罗斯媒体发表署名文章：让中白友好合作的乐章激越昂扬,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/26973455
20,80,"[, On May 7th, on the eve of Russia’s celebration of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Great Patriotic War and his visit to Russia, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Remembering History and Creating the Future"" in the Russian newspaper ""Russia."" The article is as follows: Remembering history and creating the future, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, on May 9th, when the World Anti-Fascist War Victory Day comes, I will go to Moscow at the invitation of President Putin of the Russian Federation to attend the victory of the Great Patriotic War 70 Anniversary celebration and visit Russia to celebrate this sacred holiday with the Russian people and the people of the world. Looking back at history, the war of aggression launched by fascism and militarism has brought unprecedented disasters and catastrophes in human history to many countries and peoples in Europe, Asia, and other regions in China and Russia. In that desperate battle of justice and evil, light and darkness, freedom and slavery, the people of more than 50 countries such as China and Russia united, and all the peace-loving peoples of the world united to form a broad international reaction. Fascists and the anti-militarist united front fought bloody battles, fighting side by side, and finally defeated the barbaric invaders and won world peace. , Russia is the main battlefield of Europe in World War II. In order to win the Patriotic War, the Russian people and other fraternal peoples have paid a heavy price at the expense of 27 million people, and almost every family has suffered casualties. A large number of heroes and children, such as 28 brave men, Matlosov, Zoya, and so on, defended the independence and dignity of the motherland and defended world peace and justice. , In March 2013, I paid my first state visit to Russia and presented a wreath to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier outside the red wall of the Kremlin. There, a steel helmet, a red flag, a cluster of flames that never extinguished, symbolized the tenacious and unyielding life, and symbolized the spirit of the martyr who never bowed to the aggressor. ""No one knows your name, your merits will last forever."" The Russian people will never forget, the Chinese people will never forget, and the people of the world will never forget. , China is the main battlefield of Asia in World War II. The Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan was the earliest and lasted the longest, the conditions were the most difficult, and the sacrifices they made were the heaviest as the Russian people. The indomitable and arduous struggle of the Japanese military and civilians eliminated and contained a large amount of the Japanese invaders’ military strength, and sacrificed 35 million people with huge national sacrifices. They finally won a great victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and made great contributions to the victory of the world’s anti-fascist war. Like the Russian people, the chapter of history written by the Chinese people for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan will always be etched in history. The Chinese people and the Russian people supported each other in the fight against fascism and militarism, aided each other, fought side by side, and formed a fighting friendship with blood and life. At the most difficult time of the Great Patriotic War, many passionate children of the Chinese nation resolutely joined the heroic ranks of the anti-fascist army. Mao Anying, the eldest son of Chairman Mao Zedong, as an instructor of the Belarusian first military tank company, fought thousands of miles until he captured Berlin. As the deputy commander of the Soviet Air Shooting Regiment, Chinese pilot Tang Duo fought against the sky and repeatedly made achievements in the air battle with the fascist army. The leaders of the Communist Party of China and descendants of revolutionary martyrs who studied at the Ivanovo International Children’s Hospital in Moscow, young, volunteered to dig trenches, manufacture ""Molotov"" burning flasks, produce military uniforms, food, logging, dig potatoes, and take care of injuries in hospitals Sicks, many people also donate 430 milliliters of blood to frontline soldiers every month. Chinese female reporter Hu Jibang went through the Great Patriotic War with a weak body, braved the artillery fire to report the loyalty of the Soviet people, the brutality of the fascist army, and the joy of the victory of the Russian military and civilians. Among the Chinese who contributed to the Russian Patriotic War, there are many unknown heroes. The Russian people gave precious political and moral support to the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan and supported a large number of materials and equipment. More than 2,000 Soviet pilots participated in the volunteer flying squad for aid to China to help China fight against Japanese invaders, and more than 200 people died on the Chinese battlefield. In the late period of the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Red Army went to the battlefield in Northeast China to fight against Japan with the Chinese military and civilians, providing important support for the Chinese people to win the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The Chinese people will always miss those Russian soldiers and civilians who bravely died for the cause of independent liberation of the Chinese nation. , A famous Russian historian Klyuchevsky said, ""If we lose the memory of history, our hearts will be lost in the dark."" Forgetting history means betrayal. The people of China and Russia will work with all determination in the worldOur hearts will be lost in the dark."" Forgetting history means betrayal. The people of China and Russia will work with firm determination and efforts, together with all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world, to firmly oppose denial, distortion, and tampering. The plots and actions of the history of the Second World War., China and Russia will host a series of celebrations and commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Second World War this year. The United Nations and other international and regional organizations have also or will hold a series of celebrations And commemorative activities. The purpose of our celebrations and commemorative activities is to demonstrate our determination to jointly safeguard the victory of the Second World War and international fairness and justice, and to warn the world to cherish and maintain hard-won peace., The second time The painful lessons of world wars tell people that weak meat and strong food and the law of the jungle are not the way of human coexistence. Poor soldiers and military domination are not strategies for human peace. Winners take all, zero-sum game is not the path of human development. Peace is not war, cooperation is not Confrontation and win-win rather than zero-sum is the eternal theme of human society’s peace, progress and development. Today’s human beings are more than ever able to move towards peace and development goals, and should strive to build a win-win cooperation The core of new international relations. ""Cooperation is strong, and loneliness is weak. ""Cooperation and win-win should become the basic policy orientation of all countries in dealing with international affairs. We should combine our national interests with the common interests of all countries, strive to expand the meeting point of common interests of all parties, establish a new concept of win-win, multi-win, and win-win, adhere to the same boat, Responsibility and responsibility, work together to cope with the increasing global issues such as climate change, energy and resource security, network security, and major natural disasters, and work together to care for the earth's homeland on which humanity depends.

21,81,"[, April 19, on the eve of a state visit to Pakistan, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Long Live the Friendship between the People of China and Pakistan"" in Pakistan’s ""Battle"" and ""Daily News"". The article is as follows: Long live the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan, Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, in Pakistan, there is such a Urdu poetry: ""The beautiful image of a friend is in the mirror of my heart. Just lower your head and you will see ""In my mind, Pakistan is such a good friend. When I was young, I often heard touching stories about the friendship between Pakistan and China, such as the Pakistani people building their beautiful homes with diligent hands, Pakistan provided China with an air corridor to connect with the world, and supported China’s restoration of the United Nations legal seat, etc. Wait. These stories left a deep impression on me. I look forward to the upcoming state visit to Pakistan. This is my first visit to Pakistan, but I feel like visiting my brother’s house. For a long time, under the careful cultivation of leaders of the two countries and people from all walks of life, China-Pakistan friendship is like a vigorous tree with deep roots. No matter how the international and regional situation and the domestic situation of the two countries change, China-Pakistan relations have been developing steadily and healthily. The two countries always respect, understand and support each other on issues involving each other's core interests. In Pakistan, people praise the Sino-Pakistani friendship with poetic language such as ""higher than the mountains, deeper than the sea, and sweeter than the honey."" In China, people call Pakistan ""a sincere and reliable friend"". The friendship between China and Pakistan is becoming more and more deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples. For a long time, China and Pakistan have carried out all-round mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, bearing fruitful results and bringing tangible benefits to the people of both countries. Currently, the two countries are steadily advancing the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and are committed to building a community of shared future for China and Pakistan. The starting point and foothold of China-Pakistan cooperation is to deepen the integration of the interests of the two countries and work together for common development, bring more well-being to the people of the two countries, and draw a better blueprint for development. The Pakistani government and people are committed to developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, while resolutely combating terrorism and extremism, safeguarding national security and social stability, and achieving remarkable results. As good friends and brothers, China is heartily happy for every progress and achievement made by Pakistan. I believe that as long as the Pakistani people work together and work hard together, they will surely find a development path that suits their national conditions, achieve greater achievements in national construction, and realize their dream of becoming an ""Asian Tiger"" at an early date. The Chinese people are working hard to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese dream is a dream of peace, development, cooperation and win-win. We pursue the well-being of the Chinese people and the common well-being of people of all countries. China is willing to live in harmony with South Asian countries including Pakistan and is willing to contribute to the development of South Asia. China’s proposal for the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is to achieve common development by strengthening interconnection among countries along the route. , My current state visit to Pakistan is the first leg of my first visit this year. During the visit, I will meet with Pakistani leaders such as President Hussein and Prime Minister Sharif, have extensive contacts with people from all walks of life, and exchange in-depth views with them on bilateral relations and issues of common concern. I look forward to this visit to work with Pakistani leaders to plan the overall framework for cooperation between the two countries, to promote substantial progress in the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and practical cooperation in other fields, and to advance China-Pakistan relations at a higher level. ——We must integrate the development strategies of the two countries more closely and realize the dream of the people. China and Pakistan shoulder the historic task of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood. We must strengthen strategic coordination, deepen pragmatic cooperation, work together for common development, and build China-Pakistan Community of Destiny into a model for China and neighboring countries to build a community of destiny. ---We should closely link the economic and trade strategies of the two countries and deepen economic integration. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, located at the intersection of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, is a major project of the “Belt and Road” initiative. The two sides should focus on the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, with Gwadar Port, energy, infrastructure construction, and industrial cooperation as the four key points, forming a ""1+4"" cooperation layout to drive the development of various regions of Pakistan and benefit the Pakistani people. ---We must integrate the security concerns of the two countries more closely and strengthen security cooperation. The security interests of China and Pakistan are closely related. Security cooperation and economic cooperation complement each other and promote each other. The two wheels must be turned together. We must deepen defense cooperation and strengthen coordination and cooperation on regional hot issues. , ——We want to exchange humanities between the two countriesThe wheels must turn together. We must deepen defense cooperation and strengthen coordination and cooperation on regional hot issues. ——We want to bring the two countries' humanities exchanges closer together and promote dialogues between civilizations. The two countries should transform good political relations into the driving force for cultural exchanges, and create a model for exchanges and mutual learning and friendly cooperation between different civilizations. This year is the year of China-Pakistan friendly exchanges. The two sides should carefully organize and cooperate closely to hold a series of celebration activities. Both sides should expand cooperation in personnel exchanges, language training, youth exchanges, local friendship cities, media and think tanks, so that China-Pakistan friendship can take root at the grassroots level and bring the hearts of the two peoples closer. -We need to more closely coordinate the diplomatic strategies of the two countries and build a harmonious periphery. China and Pakistan have the same or similar positions on major international and regional issues. It is necessary to maintain close communication and coordination, safeguard the common interests of the two countries, and jointly create a peaceful and stable surrounding environment. , Let us join hands and work together to create a better future for China-Pakistan relations!

22,112,"[, Dear President Zuma, Dear President of the African Union, President Mugabe, Dear Heads of State and Government, Dear Chairman of the African Union Commission Ms. Zuma, Dear colleagues, distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, friends:, 　　 is very happy to be here with so many African brothers, old and new friends in the beautiful ""Rainbow Country"" South Africa. As the co-chair of the meeting, I also warmly welcome everyone to attend the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and sincerely thank the host country South Africa for the meticulous preparation and thoughtful arrangements for this meeting. , 　　 This is my seventh time to set foot on the African continent, and it is also my second visit to Africa after being the Chinese President. Every time I come to Africa, I can see new developments and changes in Africa. , 　　 Today's Africa presents a new scene of vigorous development, which is inspiring and encouraging. Africa actively explores a development path that is in line with its own reality, insists on resolving African problems in an African way, and the momentum of independence and independence is unreasonable. Africa actively promotes industrialization, seeks independent and sustainable development, and the rapid development momentum is unreasonable. Africa is accelerating the integration process, insisting on speaking with one voice on the international stage, and the momentum of unity and self-improvement is unreasonable. , 　　 I appreciate the words said by the former President of South Africa, Mr. Mandela, ""We are standing at the dawn of the African century. In this century, Africa will occupy its place in the world's national forest."" I believe that Africa The country and the people are ushering in a new era that truly belongs to them! , 　　 The Chinese government and people are sincerely happy and proud of the development achievements made in Africa, and sincerely wish African countries and people to continue to achieve greater achievements and a better future on the road of development and progress! , 　　Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen! , 　　 China and Africa have always been a community of destiny. The common historical experience and common struggle have made the Chinese and African peoples form a profound friendship. , 　　 For a long time, we have always been in the same boat and supported each other. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway and the AU Conference Center, aided by China, have become a monument of China-Africa friendship. The Chinese government and people took the lead in the aid to Africa to fight against Ebola, leading the international community to aid Africa in the fight against epidemic disease and interpreting the brotherhood between China and Africa. African countries selflessly support China’s return to the United Nations, and donated to China after the severe earthquake disasters in Wenchuan and Yushu, China. The Chinese people remember this. The fundamental reason for China-Africa friendship to stay strong and stay alive for so long is that the two sides have always adhered to equality, sincere friendship, win-win cooperation and common development. China and Africa will always be good friends, good partners and good brothers. , 　　 At present, both China and Africa shoulder the mission of developing the country and improving people's livelihood. Africa is rich in natural and human resources, and is in the rise of industrialization. After more than 30 years of reform and opening-up, China has the material advantages in technology, equipment, talents, and capital that have helped Africa achieve independent and sustainable development. It also has strong political advantages in supporting Africa’s development. The development of China-Africa cooperation has mutual needs and complementary advantages, and has ushered in a rare historic opportunity. , 　　 Under the new situation, we must inherit and carry forward the traditional friendship between China and Africa, and we must turn the advantages of traditional friendship between China and Africa into a driving force for unity, cooperation and development, create more tangible results for the people of China and Africa, and promote the world. Make more balanced, fair and inclusive development, and make greater contributions to building a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation. , 　　Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen!　　 At present, the world pattern is undergoing profound evolution. Economic globalization and social informatization have greatly liberated and developed social productive forces. We are facing unprecedented opportunities for development. At the same time, issues such as hegemonism, terrorism, financial turmoil, and environmental crises have become increasingly prominent, bringing us unprecedented challenges. , 　　 China will uphold the true and sincere policy concept of Africa and the correct view of justice and benefit, and work with African friends to move towards a new era of win-win cooperation and common development. To this end, I propose to upgrade the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership to a comprehensive strategic partnership, and to strengthen and consolidate the ""five pillars"" for this purpose. , 　　 First, adhere to political equality and mutual trust. High political mutual trust is the cornerstone of China-Africa friendship. We must respect the development path we have chosen and do not impose our will on each other. In matters concerning the core interests and major concerns of both parties, we must adhere to mutual understanding and mutual support, and jointly safeguard fairness and justice. China has always maintained that Africa is Africa for Africans, and that Africans should be in the final position. , 　　 Second, insist on economic cooperation for a win-win situation. The Chinese pay attention to ""combining righteousness with benefit, giving priority to righteousness"". The biggest ""righteousness"" of China-Africa relations is to use China's development to help Africa's developmentEconomic win-win cooperation. The Chinese pay attention to ""combining righteousness with benefit, giving priority to righteousness"". The biggest ""righteousness"" of China-Africa relations is to use China's development to help Africa's development and ultimately achieve mutual benefit, win-win and common development. We must give full play to the advantages of China-Africa political mutual trust and economic complementarity, take cooperation in production capacity and three networks as one starting point, comprehensively deepen China-Africa cooperation in various fields, and allow the people of China and Africa to share the results of cooperation and development. , 　　 Third, insist on mutual exchanges and mutual learning in civilization. The world is beautiful because it is colorful. We are proud that both China and Africa have a long and splendid civilization. We must strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between the two civilizations of China and Africa, and strive to strengthen exchanges between people from all walks of life, such as youth, women, think tanks, media, and universities, to promote cultural integration, policy cohesion, and people-to-people connections, to promote common progress, and to make the people of China and Africa friendly from generation to generation. , 　　 Fourth, insist on security and help each other. Poverty is the source of turmoil, peace is the guarantee of development, and development is the master key to solving all problems. China supports Africans in resolving African problems in an African way, and advocates solving both the symptoms and the root causes and comprehensive measures to solve security problems. China is willing to actively participate in strengthening Africa’s ability to maintain peace and security, support Africa’s accelerated development, eliminate poverty, and achieve lasting peace. , 　　 Fifth, insist on unity and cooperation in international affairs. China and Africa share a wide range of common languages ​​and common interests in international affairs. We must strengthen consultation and cooperation, promote the development of the global governance system in a more just and reasonable direction, and safeguard common interests. China will continue to speak for justice and justice for Africa at the United Nations and other occasions, and support Africa to play a greater role on the international stage. , 　　Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen! , 　　 In order to promote the construction of China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership, China is willing to focus on implementing the “Top Ten Cooperation Plans” with the African side in the next three years, adhere to the principles of government guidance, business entities, market operation, and win-win cooperation, and strive to support Africa’s crackdown.

23,113,"[, Dear President Ruan Shengxiong, Congress, deputies, comrades and friends, hello everyone! I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to the Vietnamese Parliament and meet with the comrades. The Vietnamese Parliament is the highest state authority representing all classes of people in Vietnam. I feel very honored to take this rostrum. , 　　 First of all, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere regards and best wishes to the Communist Party of Vietnam, the Vietnamese government, and the brotherly Vietnamese people! I would like to pay high tribute to my friends who have made unremitting efforts and important contributions to China-Vietnam friendly cooperation for a long time! , 　　 70 years ago, not far from Batting Square, President Ho Chi Minh announced to the world that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was officially established. This indicates that after more than half a century of arduous struggle, the Vietnamese Communist Party, created by President Ho Chi Minh and with an excellent revolutionary tradition, led the Vietnamese people and finally achieved the great goals of national independence and national liberation. This year, the Vietnamese people celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the South, and the 125th anniversary of President Ho Chi Minh's birthday. A Chinese and Vietnamese family, the Chinese people share the happiness and joy of the Vietnamese people.　　Since modern times, our two countries have experienced the arduous journey from bullying to national independence, from closed door to reform and opening up, from poverty and backwardness to prosperity and prosperity. Since the 1980s, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have adhered to the socialist system, actively explored a development path that suits their national conditions, and have embarked on a road of socialist innovation that belongs to the Vietnamese people for the sake of the Vietnamese people. In the process of modernization and integration into the world, remarkable development achievements have been made, and profound changes have taken place in the face of the country and the lives of the people. , 　　 Today, Vietnam is making steady progress towards the goal of a socialist modern industrial country. We are heartily happy for the achievements made by Vietnamese comrades on the path of socialist innovation. I believe that under the strong leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the Vietnamese people will surely continue to win new victories in the great journey of innovation. We are willing to continue to maintain the good tradition of mutual learning, mutual learning and mutual support with our comrades in Vietnam, and work together for the development of the socialist cause of the two countries and the happiness and well-being of the two peoples. , 　　 comrades and friends! , 　　 Just as the Vietnamese people have been pursuing the dream of prosperity, national strength, democracy, fairness and civilization, achieving the prosperity of the country, national rejuvenation and people's happiness are the centuries-old dream of the Chinese nation. The dreams of the peoples of the two countries are interlinked, reflecting our common aspiration for peace, beauty and happiness. , 　　 The Chinese nation has always loved peace, the national gene of ""harmony"" has never mutated, and the culture of ""harmony"" has a long history. As early as more than 2,400 years ago, the ancient Chinese people proposed ""the use of ceremonies, harmony is precious"". The desire for peace is rooted in the hearts of the Chinese and melted in the blood of the Chinese nation. Modern China has suffered more than a century of turmoil and war, and the people have experienced deep suffering. The Chinese people love and cherish the hard-won peace situation. China’s development is inseparable from a peaceful and stable international and surrounding environment. China’s growth will strengthen the just forces that safeguard world peace. , 　　 At present, the Communist Party of China is holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, uniting and leading all forces in China, striving to achieve the establishment of the Communist Party of China in accordance with the strategic layout of building a moderately prosperous society, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively rigorously governing the party. The grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in 100 years and a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized and harmonious socialist modern country in the 100 years of the founding of New China. , 　　 We just held the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and made arrangements for China's economic and social development in the next five years, determined to firmly establish and implement the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing, and proposed to promote economic and social development A series of major political policies and major measures to organize and mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in China to make persistent efforts and take advantage of the situation to promote China's economic and social development to a new level, make the Chinese people's lives better and better, and make for the noble cause of human peace and development New and greater contribution. , 　　 comrades and friends! , 　　 China and Vietnam are linked by mountains and rivers, and the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have a long history. In the struggle for national independence and national liberation, we fought side by side, supported each other, and forged a profound friendship. In advancing the cause of socialist construction with its own characteristics, we have learned from each other and helped each other to cultivate fruitful results. The Sino-Vietnamese relationship transcends the bilateral relationship in the general sense and has very important strategic significance. , 　　 China-Vietnam diplomatic relations have gone through 65 spring and autumnResults. The Sino-Vietnamese relationship transcends the bilateral relationship in the general sense and has very important strategic significance. , 　　 China-Vietnam diplomatic relations have gone through 65 spring and autumn. During General Secretary Ruan Fuzhong's visit to China in April this year, I will summarize the past and look forward to the future with him. We unanimously believe that the traditional friendship between China and Vietnam was created by Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Ho Chi Minh and other older generation leaders. It is a valuable asset of the two parties, two countries and two peoples, and should be cherished and carefully maintained. ""Believers, the basis of making friends."" China and Vietnam have extensive common interests, and friendly cooperation has always been the mainstream. The two sides should adhere to the overall situation of Sino-Vietnamese friendship and the overall development of the two countries, adhere to mutual respect, friendly consultation, seek common ground while reserving differences, and properly handle differences. The mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Vietnam brings tangible benefits to the two peoples and contributes to the promotion of regional peace, stability and prosperity. It should be deepened and strengthened in an all-round way. These important revelations and experiences are a solid foundation for the development of Sino-Vietnamese relations, and are also the starting point and end point for both parties to deal with issues related to bilateral relations. , 　　 brothers are concentric and their profits are broken. At present, the international and regional situation is changing, and the two parties and two countries of China and Vietnam are facing many new issues and challenges that are the same or similar. More than ever before, we need to watch each other and move forward together. China attaches great importance to developing relations with Vietnam, and is willing to work with Vietnam to continue to uphold the principle of long-term stability, future-oriented, good-neighborly friendship, and comprehensive cooperation and the spirit of good neighbors, good friends, good comrades, and good partners, and promote comprehensive strategic cooperation between China and Vietnam. The partnership continues to develop steadily and healthily, bringing greater well-being to the people of both countries. , 　　 First, China and Vietnam should be good comrades of mutual trust and assistance. President Hu Zhiming said: ""The more friendship between China and China, the more comrades and brothers."" Our two countries have the same political system, the same ideals and convictions, and the same strategic interests. Adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to the socialist road, and advancing the cause of reform, opening up, and innovation are the choices of history and the choice of the people of both countries. Along the way, our cause has made great achievements. Continuing along this path, we will surely have more brilliant development prospects. , 　　 practice tells us that the direction determines the road, the road determines the fate. On the major issue of adhering to and developing the development path chosen by the people of our two countries, our two parties, two countries and two peoples should have firm confidence, support each other, and move forward hand in hand, and never let anyone interfere with our pace of progress. Let any force shake the system guarantee of our development. , 　　 China firmly supports Vietnam's innovative cause, sincerely hopes that Vietnamese comrades will achieve greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction, and sincerely hopes that Vietnam will develop better and faster. We are willing to work with Vietnamese comrades in mutual trust, mutual learning, and mutual learning, and make positive contributions to the cause of socialism and the development of human society. China is willing to fully share with the Vietnamese side the experience and understanding of various areas of national construction, and explore the theory and practice of enriching and developing socialist construction. , 　　 Second, China and Vietnam should be good partners for win-win cooperation. Looking around the world today, the international landscape is undergoing profound evolution, and the international system and international order are developing in a more just and reasonable direction. At the same time, the world is not very peaceful, local turbulence is one after another, the ghost of terrorism is not separated, the global economic growth is weak, and various traditional and non-traditional challenges are intertwined. There is a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. We must grasp the general trend of the world, keep up with the trend of the times, and jointly create a regional order and regional environment that is more beneficial to Asia and the world. China supports Vietnam to play a greater role in the international and regional arena, and is willing to strengthen cooperation with Vietnam in various international and regional mechanisms to safeguard the common interests of the two countries and promote common development in the region. , 　　 Both China and Vietnam have great economic relevance and strong complementarity, and the integration of interests is becoming increasingly close. Economic globalization and regional economic integration have brought similar opportunities and challenges to the two countries. China attaches great importance to the joint development strategies of the two countries and is willing to strengthen the interconnection of the two countries within the framework of the ""Belt and Road"" and ""Two Corridors and One Ring"". Infrastructure construction and production capacity, investment and trade cooperation have injected strong impetus into a higher level of development for China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership under the new situation. , 　　 Third, China and Vietnam should be good neighbors who meet each other. ""Thousands of gold is only for buying neighbors."" As the song ""Vietnam-China"" sings, the people of China and Vietnam ""drink a river together, meet each other early, and meet each other late."" The people of China and Vietnam lived next to each other. There was a way to learn from each other in the past, and there was a feeling of defending foreign enemies. The traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries has withstood the test of history and changing international conditions, and is an important foundation and endless driving force for the development of bilateral relations. The two sides should take the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to firmly grasp the general direction of bilateral relations and ensure that the traditional friendship between China and Vietnam is passed on from generation to generation. ,Foundation and inexhaustible motivation. The two sides should take the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to firmly grasp the general direction of bilateral relations and ensure that the traditional friendship between China and Vietnam is passed on from generation to generation. , 　　 Chinese people often say that you want to be close to each other and to be close to each other. Neighbors will inevitably bump into each other, but the two sides must insist on starting from the overall situation of the relations between the two countries, through peaceful and friendly consultations, to properly manage and handle differences, and to prevent the relations between the two countries from deviating from the correct course. I believe that under the correct leadership of the two parties and governments of China and Vietnam, the peoples of the two countries are fully capable and wise to eliminate all interference and continue writing a new chapter of China-Vietnam good-neighborly friendship and cooperation. , 　　 Fourth, China and Vietnam should be good friends who come and go often. Relatives are getting closer and closer, and friends are getting closer and closer. People's friendship is the source of strength for the development of national relations. Last year, there were more than 3 million personnel exchanges between China and Vietnam. There were 14,000 Vietnamese students studying and living in China, and 3,000 or 4,000 Chinese students studying and living in Vietnam. These figures are gratifying. , 　　 Yesterday, when I met with General Secretary Ruan Fuzhong, the two sides agreed to further active personnel exchanges, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, tourism, etc., and organize the China-Vietnam People’s Forum, the China-Vietnam Youth General Party, youth friendly meetings and other non-governmental exchange activities to The Sino-Vietnamese relationship creates a better social atmosphere. China welcomes more Vietnamese friends to study, travel, and do business in China. It is hoped that the people of the two countries will often move around, have more contacts, extensive contacts, deeper understanding, and deep friendship. , 　　 comrades and friends! , 　　 From 1942 to 1943, during his revolutionary activities in China, President Ho Chi Minh wrote a poem that reads: ""After climbing the mountain to the peak, the map of the world is looking forward to.""

24,114,"[, Mr. Chairman, colleagues: 70 years ago, our predecessors fought through bloody battles and won the world anti-fascist war, turning a dark page in human history. This victory did not come easily. 70 years ago, our ancestors established the most universal, representative, and authoritative international organization, the United Nations, with the foresight and vision, and entrusted a new vision of mankind to start a new era of cooperation. This initiative is unprecedented. 70 years ago, our ancestors gathered the wisdom of all parties, formulated the UN Charter, laid the cornerstone of the modern international order, and established the basic norms of contemporary international relations. This achievement has a profound impact. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! On September 3, the Chinese people, together with the people of the world, solemnly commemorated the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War. As the main battlefield in the East, China paid the national sacrifice of more than 35 million casualties and fought against the main forces of Japanese militarism. It not only achieved the national and national salvation, but also effectively supported the resistance forces on the battlefields in Europe and the Pacific. The victory of the world anti-fascist war made historic contributions. , History is a mirror. Only by taking history as a mirror can we avoid repeating the same mistakes. We must have awe and conscience for history. History cannot be changed, but the future can be shaped. Remembering history is not about continuing hatred, but about drawing lessons from it together. Inheriting history is not about struggling with the past, but about creating the future and letting the peaceful fire pass from generation to generation. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! The United Nations has gone through 70 years of ups and downs and has witnessed the exploration and practice of various countries to protect peace, build homes and seek cooperation. Standing at a new historical starting point, the United Nations needs to think deeply about how to better answer the major issue of world peace and development in the 21st century. The world pattern is in a historic process of accelerating evolution. The sunshine of peace, development and progress is enough to penetrate the haze of war, poverty and backwardness. Multipolarization of the world has further developed, and the rise of emerging market countries and developing countries has become an irresistible historical trend. Economic globalization and social informatization have greatly liberated and developed social productive forces, creating not only unprecedented opportunities for development, but also bringing new threats and new challenges that need to be taken seriously. , ""A trip on the avenue, the world is public."" Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom are the common values ​​of all mankind and the lofty goals of the United Nations. The goal is far from being completed, we still have to work hard. In today's world, all countries depend on each other and live together. We must inherit and promote the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, build a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation, and build a community of shared future for mankind. To this end, we need to make the following efforts. -We must establish a partnership that treats each other as equals and for mutual understanding and understanding. The UN Charter runs through the principle of sovereign equality. The future and destiny of the world must be jointly controlled by all countries. All countries in the world are equal, and they cannot be overwhelmed by the big, bullied by the strong, and rich by the rich. The principle of sovereignty is not only reflected in the inviolability of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country, but also in its internal affairs. It should also be reflected in the right of each country to independently choose its social system and development path should be safeguarded, and the practice of countries in promoting economic and social development and improving people’s lives should be respect. , We must adhere to multilateralism and not unilateralism; we must pursue a new concept of win-win, multi-win, and win-win, and throw away my old thinking of winning you and losing, and winners taking all. Consultation is an important form of democracy and should also become an important method of modern international governance. It is necessary to advocate the settlement of disputes through dialogue and the negotiation of differences. We must build a global partnership at the international and regional levels, and embark on a new path of country-to-state exchanges that ""dialogue but not confrontation, partnership and alliance."" There should be no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation between big powers. When big and small countries get along, they should treat each other as equals, and practice the correct view of justice and benefit, with both justice and benefit. ——We must create a security pattern of justice, justice and joint construction and sharing. In the era of economic globalization, the security of each country is interrelated and affects each other. No country can seek its own absolute security on its own, and no country can reap stability from the turmoil of other countries. Weak meat and strong food are the law of the jungle, not the way of getting along with each other. Poor soldiers are overbearing and can only lift stones and hit their feet. We must abandon all forms of Cold War thinking and establish a new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative, sustainable and safe. We must give full play to the core role of the United Nations and its Security Council in the cessation of peacekeeping and peacekeeping, through the peaceful settlement of disputes and the simultaneous implementation of compulsory actions, and turn dryness into a silk. We want to promote international cooperation in the economic and social fields to go hand in hand, and cope with traditional and non-traditionalSimultaneously with the two-track compulsory action, turning the gods into jade silk. We must promote international cooperation in the economic and social fields to go hand in hand, co-ordinate the response to traditional and non-traditional security threats, and prevent the scourge of war. -We must seek open and innovative development that is inclusive and mutually beneficial. The international economic and financial crisis that broke out in 2008 tells us that indulging capital for profit will result in a new round of crisis. Without a ethical market, it is difficult to support the world's building of prosperity and development. The situation where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is not only unsustainable, but also contrary to fairness and justice. It is necessary to make good use of the ""invisible hand"" and ""visible hand"", and strive to form an organic unity and mutual promotion of the role of the market and the government, and create a standardized pattern that takes into account efficiency and fairness. It is true development that everyone develops together, and sustainable development is good development. To achieve this goal, we should uphold the spirit of openness and promote mutual help and mutual benefit. In today's world, 800 million people still live in extreme poverty. Every year, nearly 6 million children die before the age of five, and nearly 60 million children fail to receive education. The just-closed UN Development Summit set the post-2015 development agenda. We must turn our commitment into action and jointly create a bright future for everyone to be free from deprivation, gain development, and enjoy dignity. , ——We want to promote peaceful and diverse, eclectic civilization exchanges. The diversity of human civilization has endowed the world with colorful colors. Diversity brings communication, and communication fosters integration, and integration produces progress. , Civilization needs harmony and different spirits. Only by respecting each other, learning from each other, and coexisting in harmony can this world be rich and prosperous. Different civilizations condense the wisdom and contributions of different peoples, there is no difference between high and low, and there is no distinction between advantages and disadvantages. Dialogue among civilizations should not be excluded; exchange should not be replaced. Human history is a magnificent picture where different civilizations communicate with each other, learn from each other, and merge. We must respect all civilizations, treat each other as equals, learn from each other, learn from each other and learn from each other, and promote the creative development of human civilization. -We must build an ecological system that respects nature and green development. Humans can use nature and transform nature, but in the final analysis, it is a part of nature. It must protect nature and cannot override it. We must solve the contradictions brought about by industrial civilization, aim at the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, and realize the sustainable development of the world and the comprehensive development of man. , Building an ecological civilization is about the future of mankind. The international community should go hand in hand to seek the road of global ecological civilization construction, firmly establish the consciousness of respecting nature, adapting to nature and protecting nature, and stick to the road of green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. In this regard, China is duty-bound and will continue to make its own contribution. At the same time, we urge developed countries to assume historic responsibility, honor their commitments to reduce emissions, and help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! More than 1.3 billion Chinese people are struggling to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The dreams of the Chinese people are closely linked to the dreams of people of all countries. The realization of the Chinese dream is inseparable from a peaceful international environment and a stable international order, as well as the understanding, support and help of people of all countries. The realization of the Chinese people's dreams will surely create more opportunities for all countries and will better promote world peace and development. , China will always be a builder of world peace, and firmly follow the path of peaceful development. No matter how the international situation changes or how it develops, China will never seek hegemony, never expand, or will never seek sphere of influence. , China will always be a contributor to global development, adhere to the path of common development, continue to pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, share its own development experience and opportunities with all countries in the world, and welcome all countries to take China’s development “windmill” to achieve together Develop together. , China will always be the maintainer of the international order and adhere to the path of cooperative development. China is the first country to sign the UN Charter and will continue to maintain the international order and international system centered on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China will continue to stand with the vast number of developing countries and firmly support the increasing representation and voice of developing countries, especially African countries, in the international governance system. China's vote in the United Nations will always belong to a developing country. Here, I announce that China has decided to establish a 10-year China-United Nations Peace and Development Fund with a total value of US$1 billion to support the work of the United Nations, promote multilateral cooperation, and make new contributions to world peace and development. I announced that China will join the new UN peacekeeping capability standby mechanism, and decided to take the lead in forming a standing peacekeeping police force for this purpose, and build a 8,000-person peacekeeping standby force. I announced that China has decided to provide AU$100 million in unpaid military assistance to the African Union in the next five years to support the construction of the African Standing Army and the rapid response force for crisis response. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! ,Free military assistance in the amount of US$100 million to support the construction of the African Standing Army and the rapid response force for crisis response. , Mr. Chairman, colleagues! As the United Nations ushers in another 10 years, let us unite more closely, work together to build new partners for win-win cooperation, and work together to build a community of shared future for mankind. Let the concept of casting swords into plows and never fight deep in people's hearts, let the concept of development, prosperity, fairness and justice practice the world! , Thank you. , (Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, September 28th), ""People's Daily"" (September 29, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech during the general debate of the 70th UN General Assembly,3144,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-09-29,"[, 主席先生，各位同事：, 70年前，我们的先辈经过浴血奋战，取得了世界反法西斯战争的胜利，翻过了人类历史上黑暗的一页。这一胜利来之不易。, 70年前，我们的先辈以远见卓识，建立了联合国这一最具普遍性、代表性、权威性的国际组织，寄托人类新愿景，开启合作新时代。这一创举前所未有。, 70年前，我们的先辈集各方智慧，制定了联合国宪章，奠定了现代国际秩序基石，确立了当代国际关系基本准则。这一成就影响深远。, 主席先生、各位同事！, 9月3日，中国人民同世界人民一道，隆重纪念了中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年。作为东方主战场，中国付出了伤亡3500多万人的民族牺牲，抗击了日本军国主义主要兵力，不仅实现了国家和民族的救亡图存，而且有力支援了在欧洲和太平洋战场上的抵抗力量，为赢得世界反法西斯战争胜利作出了历史性贡献。, 历史是一面镜子。以史为鉴，才能避免重蹈覆辙。对历史，我们要心怀敬畏、心怀良知。历史无法改变，但未来可以塑造。铭记历史，不是为了延续仇恨，而是要共同引以为戒。传承历史，不是为了纠结过去，而是要开创未来，让和平的薪火代代相传。, 主席先生、各位同事！, 联合国走过了70年风风雨雨，见证了各国为守护和平、建设家园、谋求合作的探索和实践。站在新的历史起点上，联合国需要深入思考如何在21世纪更好回答世界和平与发展这一重大课题。, 世界格局正处在一个加快演变的历史性进程之中。和平、发展、进步的阳光足以穿透战争、贫穷、落后的阴霾。世界多极化进一步发展，新兴市场国家和发展中国家崛起已经成为不可阻挡的历史潮流。经济全球化、社会信息化极大解放和发展了社会生产力，既创造了前所未有的发展机遇，也带来了需要认真对待的新威胁新挑战。, “大道之行也，天下为公。”和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由，是全人类的共同价值，也是联合国的崇高目标。目标远未完成，我们仍须努力。当今世界，各国相互依存、休戚与共。我们要继承和弘扬联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造人类命运共同体。为此，我们需要作出以下努力。, ——我们要建立平等相待、互商互谅的伙伴关系。联合国宪章贯穿主权平等原则。世界的前途命运必须由各国共同掌握。世界各国一律平等，不能以大压小、以强凌弱、以富欺贫。主权原则不仅体现在各国主权和领土完整不容侵犯、内政不容干涉，还应该体现在各国自主选择社会制度和发展道路的权利应当得到维护，体现在各国推动经济社会发展、改善人民生活的实践应当受到尊重。, 我们要坚持多边主义，不搞单边主义；要奉行双赢、多赢、共赢的新理念，扔掉我赢你输、赢者通吃的旧思维。协商是民主的重要形式，也应该成为现代国际治理的重要方法，要倡导以对话解争端、以协商化分歧。我们要在国际和区域层面建设全球伙伴关系，走出一条“对话而不对抗，结伴而不结盟”的国与国交往新路。大国之间相处，要不冲突、不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢。大国与小国相处，要平等相待，践行正确义利观，义利相兼，义重于利。, ——我们要营造公道正义、共建共享的安全格局。在经济全球化时代，各国安全相互关联、彼此影响。没有一个国家能凭一己之力谋求自身绝对安全，也没有一个国家可以从别国的动荡中收获稳定。弱肉强食是丛林法则，不是国与国相处之道。穷兵黩武是霸道做法，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。, 我们要摒弃一切形式的冷战思维，树立共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的新观念。我们要充分发挥联合国及其安理会在止战维和方面的核心作用，通过和平解决争端和强制性行动双轨并举，化干戈为玉帛。我们要推动经济和社会领域的国际合作齐头并进，统筹应对传统和非传统安全威胁，防战争祸患于未然。, ——我们要谋求开放创新、包容互惠的发展前景。2008年爆发的国际经济金融危机告诉我们，放任资本逐利，其结果将是引发新一轮危机。缺乏道德的市场，难以撑起世界繁荣发展的大厦。富者愈富、穷者愈穷的局面不仅难以持续，也有违公平正义。要用好“看不见的手”和“看得见的手”，努力形成市场作用和政府作用有机统一、相互促进，打造兼顾效率和公平的规范格局。, 大家一起发展才是真发展，可持续发展才是好发展。要实现这一目标，就应该秉承开放精神，推进互帮互助、互惠互利。当今世界仍有8亿人生活在极端贫困之中，每年近600万孩子在5岁前夭折，近6000万儿童未能接受教育。刚刚闭幕的联合国发展峰会制定了2015年后发展议程。我们要将承诺变为行动，共同营造人人免于匮乏、获得发展、享有尊严的光明前景。, ——我们要促进和而不同、兼收并蓄的文明交流。人类文明多样性赋予这个世界姹紫嫣红的色彩，多样带来交流，交流孕育融合，融合产生进步。, 文明相处需要和而不同的精神。只有在多样中相互尊重、彼此借鉴、和谐共存，这个世界才能丰富多彩、欣欣向荣。不同文明凝聚着不同民族的智慧和贡献，没有高低之别，更无优劣之分。文明之间要对话，不要排斥；要交流，不要取代。人类历史就是一幅不同文明相互交流、互鉴、融合的宏伟画卷。我们要尊重各种文明，平等相待，互学互鉴，兼收并蓄，推动人类文明实现创造性发展。, ——我们要构筑尊崇自然、绿色发展的生态体系。人类可以利用自然、改造自然，但归根结底是自然的一部分，必须呵护自然，不能凌驾于自然之上。我们要解决好工业文明带来的矛盾，以人与自然和谐相处为目标，实现世界的可持续发展和人的全面发展。, 建设生态文明关乎人类未来。国际社会应该携手同行，共谋全球生态文明建设之路，牢固树立尊重自然、顺应自然、保护自然的意识，坚持走绿色、低碳、循环、可持续发展之路。在这方面，中国责无旁贷，将继续作出自己的贡献。同时，我们敦促发达国家承担历史性责任，兑现减排承诺，并帮助发展中国家减缓和适应气候变化。, 主席先生、各位同事！, 13亿多中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。中国人民的梦想同各国人民的梦想息息相通。实现中国梦，离不开和平的国际环境和稳定的国际秩序，离不开各国人民的理解、支持、帮助。中国人民圆梦必将给各国创造更多机遇，必将更好促进世界和平与发展。, 中国将始终做世界和平的建设者，坚定走和平发展道路，无论国际形势如何变化，无论自身如何发展，中国永不称霸、永不扩张、永不谋求势力范围。, 中国将始终做全球发展的贡献者，坚持走共同发展道路，继续奉行互利共赢的开放战略，将自身发展经验和机遇同世界各国分享，欢迎各国搭乘中国发展“顺风车”，一起来实现共同发展。, 中国将始终做国际秩序的维护者，坚持走合作发展的道路。中国是第一个在联合国宪章上签字的国家，将继续维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序和国际体系。中国将继续同广大发展中国家站在一起，坚定支持增加发展中国家特别是非洲国家在国际治理体系中的代表性和发言权。中国在联合国的一票永远属于发展中国家。, 在此，我宣布，中国决定设立为期10年、总额10亿美元的中国—联合国和平与发展基金，支持联合国工作，促进多边合作事业，为世界和平与发展作出新的贡献。我宣布，中国将加入新的联合国维和能力待命机制，决定为此率先组建常备成建制维和警队，并建设8000人规模的维和待命部队。我宣布，中国决定在未来5年内，向非盟提供总额为1亿美元的无偿军事援助，以支持非洲常备军和危机应对快速反应部队建设。, 主席先生、各位同事！, 在联合国迎来又一个10年之际，让我们更加紧密地团结起来，携手构建合作共赢新伙伴，同心打造人类命运共同体。让铸剑为犁、永不再战的理念深植人心，让发展繁荣、公平正义的理念践行人间！, 谢谢各位。, （新华社联合国9月28日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年09月29日 02 版）, ]",习近平在第七十届联合国大会一般性辩论时的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/27644987
25,115,"[, Dear colleagues: 　　 is very happy to come to the beautiful Ufa to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. Thanks to the host Russia for the careful preparation and thoughtful arrangements for the smooth holding of this summit. Over the past year, Russia, as its presidency, has done a lot of fruitful work to deepen cooperation in various fields of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, laying a solid foundation for the next phase of the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China highly appreciates this. Since the Dushanbe summit last year, the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization have closely cooperated and supported each other to properly respond to changes in the situation, strengthened the maintenance of security and stability in the region, and enhanced the level of interest integration and exchanges and cooperation among member countries. Cohesion continues to increase. At the same time, it should also be noted that due to internal and external factors such as turbulence in the international and regional situations, the confluence of the ""three forces"" and the increasing downward pressure on the regional economies, the region’s security, stability and economic development have encountered considerable difficulties and challenges. The external situation facing the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is not optimistic. , 　　 We must accelerate the pace and take concrete actions, guided by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's development strategy to 2025, to promote the organization to achieve a new leap forward at a new starting point, and provide solid guarantees and powerful assistance for the countries in the region to jointly maintain stability and promote development. , 　　 First, adhere to the ""Shanghai Spirit"" and build a community of shared destiny in this region. Over the past 15 years, the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and the pursuit of common development has become the foundation on which the Shanghai Cooperation Organization relies on survival and development, and represents the direction of development of international relations today. , 　　 Today, ""Shanghai Spirit"" still has the significance of the times. We must continue to use the ""Shanghai Spirit"" as a guide, uphold the Shanghai International Cooperation Organization's consistent international relations norms, maintain international fairness and justice, advocate multilateralism and openness, respect each other's interests, not interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and resolve differences peacefully. Disputes, promote development and prosperity with a win-win concept. Let the ""Shanghai Spirit"" be more deeply rooted and promoted in this region, and become a spiritual link for the members of the Organization to build a community of shared destiny and build a harmonious home. , 　　 The painful lesson of war cannot be forgotten. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. All member countries of the Organization have experienced the test of blood and fire in the Second World War and have made tremendous sacrifices for the victory of the war. After the summit, the heads of state will issue a statement on the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the Second World War, and a unified voice calling for peace. We must continue to be a firm force defending the victory of the Second World War, and we must never allow anyone to distort history and trample on peace. , 　　 Taking this opportunity, on behalf of China, I would like to express my deep respect for the martyrs who fought bravely in World War II and sacrificed their lives for the cause of human justice. My heartfelt thanks to the national and international friends who supported the Chinese people against Japanese militarism! , 　　 Secondly, strengthen the ability to move and build a regional security barrier. Maintaining regional security and stability is a common concern of all members of the Organization. It is the responsibility of this Organization to prevent the regional situation from becoming chaotic, to prevent the proliferation of terrorism and religious extremism, and to prevent ulterior motives from undermining regional peace and stability. , 　　 We must strengthen policy communication and coordination, study countermeasures, and jointly maintain the power, system, social security and stability of member states. , 　　 We must respond well to the situation in Afghanistan, strengthen security cooperation with Afghanistan, help the Afghan security forces strengthen capacity building, and play a greater role in the process of promoting national reconciliation and economic reconstruction in Afghanistan. , 　　 We must vigorously promote cooperation in counter-terrorism, drug control and defense, improve the organization's security operations capabilities, and form a more rigorous and sound law enforcement cooperation network. Accelerating the establishment of a center for responding to security challenges and threats on the basis of regional anti-terrorism organizations and strengthening the organization’s anti-drug function will have urgent practical significance for the organization to respond to security challenges. China welcomes the signing of the ""Border Defense Cooperation Agreement"" by member countries this time to improve the legal basis of the organization's security cooperation and consolidate the stability of the member countries' external borders. It is willing to work with all parties to study and draft the organization's ""Anti-Extremism Convention"". , 　　 Third, deepen the potential of cooperation and enrich the content of pragmatic cooperation. Seeking new growth points and improving the livelihood of society is a major task for the member states of the Organization. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization should push all parties to create more opportunities for cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results, and promote early gains in regional economic cooperation. , 　　 We must take greater steps in trade and investment facilitation and liberalization. It is necessary to expand the scale of trade, optimize the trade structure, formulate common measures, and coordinate policies in the fields of economy, trade, customs, quality inspection, and transportation. , 　　 Interconnection of transportation facilities is a priorityFormulate common measures to coordinate policies in the fields of economy, trade, customs, quality inspection, and transportation. , 　　 Interconnection of transportation facilities is a priority area and an important foundation for regional cooperation.

China is willing to strengthen cooperation with all parties, give priority to the implementation of interconnected projects that have reached consensus, provide financial support for project feasibility studies and planning, and participate in investment and financing cooperation in design and construction.

China is willing to promote the establishment of cooperation parks in each member country in accordance with market principles and continuously deepen production capacity cooperation. , 　　 The establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Development Bank is a strategic measure to promote the multilateral cooperation of the organization and has a profound significance for the future development of the organization. We should stick to this direction and strive to build a cost organization's own financing platform at an early date to serve multilateral inclusive projects and the economic development of various countries. At this stage, China is willing to use the Silk Road Fund, the China-Eurasia Economic Cooperation Fund and other financial platforms to solve the investment needs of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member countries, combined with the ""2017 to 2021 Shanghai Cooperation Organization to further promote project cooperation measures list"", focusing on Carry out investment cooperation in major infrastructure projects, resource development, industrial and financial cooperation and other fields. , 　　 China is implementing a plan to train 2,000 talents for the SCO member states within 3 years.

We must continue to expand trade in agricultural products, develop cooperation in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, and jointly guarantee food security. China is willing to continue to use Chinese funds to train agricultural technicians for member countries and improve the agricultural technology and food production levels of various countries. The Chinese side proposes to formulate the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Science and Technology Partnership Program"" to accelerate the construction of an environmental information sharing platform, and is willing to work with other countries to give full play to the mechanisms of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Industrial Committee and the Banking Consortium.　　With the support and response of all parties, the Chinese proposal to jointly build the Silk Road Economic Belt was successfully implemented. We hope that the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the development plans of the SCO countries will complement each other. We will work with relevant countries to implement the integration of the Silk Road Economic Belt with the Eurasian Economic Union and promote balanced development in the Eurasian region. , 　　 Fourth, to promote people's hearts and to consolidate good-neighborly friendship for generations. The ancient Silk Road has witnessed the profound traditional friendship formed by people of all countries.

This year, 200 Russian primary and middle school students from Ufa City, where the summit will be held, will go to China. China will complete the summer camp activities for 2,000 elementary and middle school students in member countries by 2018. , 　　 In 2014, the number of Chinese overseas tourists and other outbound travelers exceeded 100 million. Russia and Uzbekistan are already destinations for Chinese citizens traveling abroad. We are willing to share with the other countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization the enormous opportunities China's outbound tourism development brings to the economies of various countries. We also hope that countries will simplify the visa procedures for Chinese citizens to travel to relevant countries. , 　　 China supports countries in strengthening judicial exchanges and cooperation, and is willing to rely on the China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization International Judicial Exchanges and Cooperation Training Base to assist member countries in training judicial talents. , 　　 China supports member countries to continue to strengthen cooperation in areas such as emergency disaster relief, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and facilitation of personnel exchanges, and is willing to study and explore measures for cooperation in traditional Chinese medicine with other countries, simplifying visa and labor licensing procedures. , 　　 Fifth, maintain openness and mutual learning and promote organizational development.

26,116,"[, Dear President Zoko, Dear Colleagues, Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends: Today, leaders of Asian and African countries gathered in beautiful Jakarta to jointly commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference Non-friendly cooperation and development and revitalization are of great significance. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Zoko and the Indonesian government! To convey to you the sincere greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people! 60 years ago, leaders of 29 countries and regions in Asia and Africa attended the Bandung Conference, forming the Bandung spirit of solidarity, friendship and cooperation, promoting the national liberation movement of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and accelerating the historical process of the collapse of the global colonial system . On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the meeting put forward ten principles for dealing with relations between countries, which played a major historical role in promoting the development of international relations in the right direction, promoting Asian-African cooperation, South-South cooperation, and promoting North-South cooperation. effect. Therefore, the Bandung Conference is a milestone in the solidarity and cooperation of the Asian and African peoples. In the past 60 years, the two ancient continents of Asia and Africa have undergone extensive and profound changes. The people of Asian and African countries have mastered their own destiny, won political independence one after another, and are firmly committed to economic and social development, pushing the two continents of Asia and Africa from a poor and backward region to a region with great development vitality. Inspired by the Bandung spirit, Asian and African countries have united and strengthened themselves, and regional, subregional, and cross-regional cooperation are flourishing. They are playing an increasingly important role in regional and international affairs, and their status in the global strategic situation is rising. Today, 60 years later, the trend of times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is stronger, and countries are becoming more and more a community of destiny between you and me. At the same time, it should be noted that the world is still very uneven, local turbulence is rising one after another, global problems such as terrorism and major infectious diseases are increasing, the gap between North and South is still wide, and the sovereign security, solidarity and cooperation and common development of Asian and African countries still face Less difficulties and challenges. Under the new situation, the Bandung spirit still has strong vitality. We must vigorously promote the Bandung spirit, continue to give it new connotations of the times, promote the construction of a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core, promote the development of the international order and international system in a more just and reasonable direction, and promote the building of a community of human destiny, Better benefit the people of Asia, Africa and other regions. To this end, I would like to propose the following initiatives. , First, deepen Asian-African cooperation. Both continents of Asia and Africa are important birthplaces of human civilization, with a total population of three-quarters of the world and more than half the number of member states of the United Nations. Asian-African cooperation has increasingly important global significance. Faced with new opportunities and new challenges, Asian and African countries should stick to mutual security and mutual help, seize opportunities, meet challenges together, improve the level of Asian-African cooperation, and continue to be good friends, good partners, and good brothers who share the same hardships. , There is a proverb in Africa, ""A log cannot cover a house"". There is also an old saying in China, ""Lone movers are hard to get up, but all walkers are easy to move."" The strengthening of mutually beneficial cooperation between Asian and African countries can have a positive effect of ""one plus one is greater than two"". We must adhere to the mutually beneficial and win-win, common development, docking development strategy, strengthen infrastructure interconnection, promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields such as industry, agriculture, human resources development, create new highlights of cooperation in green energy, environmental protection, e-commerce, etc. Economic complementarity translates into mutual development assistance. It is necessary to deepen regional and cross-regional cooperation, make good use of existing regional and subregional cooperation mechanisms, establish new cooperation platforms in due course, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and build a wide-ranging, multi-level, and comprehensive new pattern of Asian-African cooperation . , There are more than 100 countries in the Asia-Africa region. Social systems, history, culture, and values ​​vary greatly, and together they form a colorful civilization picture. We must persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, be open and inclusive, learn from each other's strengths in exchanges and learn from each other, and advance together in seeking common ground while reserving differences, so that all civilizations can shine their own brilliance. Asian-African cooperation is not closed and exclusive, but open and win-win. We welcome other countries to actively participate and make constructive contributions. , Second, expand South-South cooperation. At that time, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, the chief designer of China's reform and opening up, said that the term South-South cooperation is very good, and the inventor should be given a medal. The vast majority of developing countries are faced with the common mission of accelerating development and improving people's livelihood. They should gather together to keep warm, support and move forward, and actively carry out cooperation in various fields to achieve our respective blueprints for development. Doing a good job in Asian-African cooperation will play an important role in leading South-South cooperation. , Asian-African countries should deepen cooperation, at the same time, strengthen solidarity and cooperation with developing countries in Latin America, South Pacific and other regions, expand dialogue and exchanges in the governance of the country, and work closely on major international and regional issues.The solidarity and cooperation of developing countries in Latin America, South Pacific and other regions, expand dialogue and exchanges on governance, strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional issues, and strengthen the power to maintain world peace and promote common development. , To strengthen South-South cooperation, it is necessary to strengthen mechanism building. It is necessary to give full play to the mechanisms of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and other mechanisms, build a cooperation platform for mutual cooperation and trust measures in Asia, BRICS, and other cooperation platforms, promote dialogue and exchanges between developing country regional organizations, and explore the establishment of a new South-South cooperation framework . China supports the Indonesian initiative to establish the Asia-Africa Center. To enhance the representation and voice of developing countries in the international system, guide the post-2015 development agenda negotiations to focus on solving the difficulties and challenges faced by developing countries, especially African countries and LDCs, and better safeguard developing countries The legitimate rights and interests of the country. , Third, promote North-South cooperation. The Bandung spirit is not only applicable to Asian-African cooperation and South-South cooperation, but also has important implications for promoting North-South cooperation. Achieving balanced development in the world cannot be based on the fact that one group of countries is getting richer and the other group of countries is chronically poor and backward. From a strategic perspective of building a community with a shared future for mankind, North-South relations are not only a question of economic development, but also a global issue that is related to world peace and stability. , Persisting in mutual respect and treating each other as equals is the political basis for North-South cooperation. The basis for win-win cooperation is equality, and it is difficult to achieve win-win cooperation without equality. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community and have equal rights to participate in regional and international affairs. We must respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all countries, respect the social system and development path independently chosen by each country, oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and oppose the imposition of their will on others. It is the responsibility and obligation of developed countries to help developing countries to narrow the gap between North and South. It is necessary to promote developed countries to earnestly fulfill their official development assistance commitments, increase support for developing countries on the basis of no political conditions attached, enhance their independent development capabilities, and establish a more equal and balanced new global development partnership. We must maintain and develop an open world economy, promote the construction of a fair, just, inclusive and orderly international economic and financial system, and create a favorable external environment for the development of developing countries. , Abandon the old concepts of Cold War thinking, zero-sum game, advocate new concepts of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, insist on peaceful settlement of differences and disputes through dialogue and consultation, and jointly deal with terrorism, public health, cyber security, climate change, etc. Non-traditional security issues and global challenges, building a community of shared destiny, embarking on a new road of security for common construction, sharing, and win-win results, and jointly safeguarding regional and world peace and stability. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China is an active advocate and promoter of Asian-African solidarity and cooperation. It has always firmly supported the just cause of Asian and African countries for national liberation, firmly promoted the common development of Asian and African countries, and provided sincere and selfless assistance to Asian and African countries. China has also received valuable support and assistance from Asian and African countries in the process of safeguarding national sovereignty, advancing national unification, and realizing national development. The Chinese people will never forget this. Under the new situation, China will unswervingly advance Asian-African cooperation. China has signed good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaties with eight neighboring countries, and is willing to negotiate good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaties with all neighboring countries. It will strengthen peace and security cooperation with African countries and help Africa strengthen its capabilities in peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, and combating piracy. China is willing to cooperate in production capacity with Asian and African countries, support African countries in building high-speed railways, highways, and regional aviation networks, and promote Asian-African industrialization. China will give zero-tariff treatment to 97% of the tax items of least developed countries that have established diplomatic relations during the year, and will continue to provide assistance to developing countries without any political conditions. China is willing to work together with relevant parties to advance the construction of the “Belt and Road”, jointly build an Asian infrastructure investment bank, and play a role in the Silk Road Fund. China will work with relevant countries to improve China-ASEAN, China-Arab Cooperation Forum, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other cooperation platforms, and hold the 6th Ministerial Conference of China-Africa Cooperation Forum held in South Africa this year. China will continue to promote South-South and North-South cooperation, jointly safeguard regional and world peace and stability, and promote common development and prosperity. , I would like to announce here: China will provide 100,000 training places to Asian and African developing countries in the next five years; the Asian-African Youth Festival will be held continuously in China, and a total of 2,000 Asian and African youths will be invited to visit and participate in the festival; The establishment of the China-Asia-Africa Cooperation Center to further promote exchanges and cooperation among Asian and African countries; the establishment of the China-Asia-African Association for International Law Exchange and Research Project; an international seminar on the theme of promoting the Bandung spirit will also be held during the year, and all parties are welcome to actively participate. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Currently, ChinaAn international seminar on the theme of promoting the Bandung spirit will be held, and all parties are welcome to actively participate. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, the Chinese people are working together to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in accordance with the strategic layout of building a well-off society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly. . The Chinese Dream is closely linked to the beautiful dreams of the people of Asia and Africa and other peoples, not only for the Chinese people, but also for the people of other countries. The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation and has always advocated ""harmony is precious"". China will adhere to the path of peaceful development, adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, adhere to the correct concept of justice and benefit, develop friendly cooperation with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and always maintain world peace , A firm force to promote common development. No matter what step it takes to develop, no matter how the international situation changes, China will always be a reliable friend and sincere partner of developing countries. This is the basis of China's foreign policy, and it will not change in the past, present and future. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! According to the Chinese, every 60 years is a chronological cycle. Asian-African cooperation has gone through 60 springs and autumns and is coming to a new starting point. Looking back at the past 60 years, China and Asian and African countries have been in the same boat together, and they are in solidarity with each other. Their mutual relationship is like the waters of the Yangtze, Thoreau and Nile rivers. Looking ahead, we should carry forward the Bandung spirit, jointly realize the dream of revitalizing Asia and Africa, bring more well-being to the people of Asia and Africa, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development of mankind! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 22nd), ""People's Daily"" (April 23, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the meeting of Asian and African leaders,3533,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-04-23,"[, 尊敬的佐科总统，, 尊敬的各位同事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天，亚非国家领导人汇聚在美丽的雅加达，共同纪念万隆会议召开60周年，共商亚非友好合作和发展振兴大计，具有十分重要的意义。首先，我谨向佐科总统和印度尼西亚政府，表示衷心的感谢！向大家转达中国人民的诚挚问候和良好祝愿！, 60年前，亚非29个国家和地区领导人出席了万隆会议，形成了团结、友谊、合作的万隆精神，促进了亚非拉民族解放运动，加速了全球殖民体系瓦解的历史进程。会议在和平共处五项原则基础上，提出处理国家间关系的十项原则，为推动国际关系朝着正确方向发展，为推动亚非合作、南南合作，为促进南北合作，发挥了重大历史性作用。因此，万隆会议是亚非人民团结合作的一个里程碑。, 60年来，亚非这两片古老大陆发生了广泛而深刻的变化。亚非各国人民掌握了自己命运，相继赢得了政治独立，坚定致力于经济社会发展，推动亚非两大洲从过去贫穷落后的地区成为具有巨大发展活力的地区。在万隆精神激励下，亚非国家联合自强，区域、次区域、跨区域合作方兴未艾，在地区和国际事务中发挥着越来越重要的作用，在世界战略全局中的地位不断上升。, 60年后的今天，和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流更加强劲，各国越来越成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。同时，应该看到，世界还很不太平，局部动荡此起彼伏，恐怖主义、重大传染性疾病等全球性问题不断增多，南北差距依然悬殊，亚非国家的主权安全、团结合作、共同发展依然面临不少困难和挑战。, 新形势下，万隆精神仍然具有强大生命力。我们要大力弘扬万隆精神，不断赋予其新的时代内涵，推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，推动国际秩序和国际体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展，推动建设人类命运共同体，更好造福亚非人民及其他地区人民。为此，我愿提出如下倡议。, 第一，深化亚非合作。亚非两大洲都是人类文明的重要发源地，人口总量占世界的四分之三，国家数量超过联合国会员国的一半，亚非合作具有越来越重要的全球意义。面对新机遇新挑战，亚非国家要坚持安危与共、守望相助，把握机遇、共迎挑战，提高亚非合作水平，继续做休戚与共、同甘共苦的好朋友、好伙伴、好兄弟。, 非洲有句谚语，“一根原木盖不起一幢房屋”。中国也有句古话，“孤举者难起，众行者易趋”。亚非国家加强互利合作，能产生“一加一大于二”的积极效应。我们要坚持互利共赢、共同发展，对接发展战略，加强基础设施互联互通，推进工业、农业、人力资源开发等各领域务实合作，打造绿色能源、环保、电子商务等合作新亮点，把亚非经济互补性转化为发展互助力。要深化区域和跨区域合作，用好现有区域和次区域合作机制，适时建立新的合作平台，推动贸易和投资自由化便利化，构建宽领域、多层次、全方位的亚非合作新格局。, 亚非地区有100多个国家，社会制度、历史文化、价值观念千差万别，共同构成异彩纷呈的文明画卷。我们要坚持求同存异、开放包容，在交流互鉴中取长补短，在求同存异中共同前进，让各个文明都绽放出自己的光彩。亚非合作不是封闭的、排他的，而是开放的、共赢的，我们欢迎其他地区国家积极参与并作出建设性贡献。, 第二，拓展南南合作。当年，中国改革开放的总设计师邓小平先生说，南南合作这个提法很好，应该给发明者一枚勋章。广大发展中国家都面临着加快发展、改善民生的共同使命，应该抱团取暖、扶携前行，积极开展各领域合作，实现我们各自的发展蓝图。搞好亚非合作，对南南合作具有重要示范带动作用。, 亚非国家要深化合作，同时要加强同拉美、南太及其他地区发展中国家的团结合作，扩大在治国理政方面的对话交流，密切在重大国际和地区问题上的沟通和协调，壮大维护世界和平、促进共同发展的力量。, 加强南南合作，需要加强机制建设。要发挥好不结盟运动、七十七国集团等机制的作用，建设好亚洲相互协作与信任措施会议、金砖国家等合作平台，推动发展中国家区域组织开展对话交流，探讨建立南南合作新架构。中方支持印尼方建立亚非中心的倡议。要提高发展中国家在国际体系内的代表性和发言权，引导2015年后发展议程谈判重点关注解决发展中国家、特别是非洲国家和最不发达国家面临的困难和挑战，更好维护发展中国家正当权益。, 第三，推进南北合作。万隆精神不仅适用于亚非合作、南南合作，对促进南北合作也具有重要启示和借鉴意义。实现世界均衡发展，不可能建立在一批国家越来越富裕、另一批国家长期贫穷落后的基础之上。从建设人类命运共同体的战略高度看，南北关系不仅是一个经济发展问题，而且是一个事关世界和平稳定的全局性问题。, 坚持相互尊重、平等相待，是开展南北合作的政治基础。合作共赢的基础是平等，离开了平等难以实现合作共赢。国家不分大小、强弱、贫富，都是国际社会平等成员，都有平等参与地区和国际事务的权利。要尊重各国主权、独立、领土完整，尊重各国自主选择的社会制度和发展道路，反对干涉别国内政，反对把自己的意志强加于人。, 帮助发展中国家发展、缩小南北差距，是发达国家应该承担的责任和义务。要推动发达国家切实履行官方发展援助承诺，在不附带政治条件基础上，加大对发展中国家支持力度，增强发展中国家自主发展能力，建立更加平等均衡的新型全球发展伙伴关系。要维护和发展开放型世界经济，推动建设公平公正、包容有序的国际经济金融体系，为发展中国家发展营造良好外部环境。, 要摒弃冷战思维、零和博弈的旧观念，倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续安全的新理念，坚持通过对话协商和平解决分歧争端，共同应对恐怖主义、公共卫生、网络安全、气候变化等非传统安全问题和全球性挑战，建设命运共同体，走出一条共建、共享、共赢的安全新路，共同维护地区和世界和平稳定。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国是亚非团结合作的积极倡导者和推动者，始终坚定支持亚非国家争取民族解放的正义事业，坚定促进亚非国家共同发展，并向亚非国家提供了真诚无私的援助。中国在维护国家主权、推进国家统一、实现国家发展的进程中，也得到了亚非国家的宝贵支持和帮助。中国人民对此永远不会忘记。, 新形势下，中国将坚定不移推进亚非合作。中国已经同周边8个国家签署睦邻友好合作条约，愿同所有周边国家商签睦邻友好合作条约，将加强同非洲国家和平安全合作，帮助非方增强维和、反恐、打击海盗等方面能力。中国愿同亚非国家开展产能合作，支持非洲国家建设高速铁路、高速公路、区域航空网络，推动亚非工业化进程。中国将于年内对已建交的最不发达国家97%税目产品给予零关税待遇，并将继续向发展中国家提供不附加任何政治条件的援助。中国愿同有关各方一道推进“一带一路”建设，共同建设好亚洲基础设施投资银行，发挥好丝路基金作用。中国将同有关国家一道，完善中国—东盟、中阿合作论坛、上海合作组织等合作平台，办好年内在南非召开的中非合作论坛第六届部长级会议。中国将继续推动南南合作及南北合作，共同维护地区和世界和平稳定，促进共同发展繁荣。, 我愿在这里宣布：中国未来5年内将向亚非发展中国家提供10万名培训名额；连续在华举办亚非青年联欢节，共邀请2000名亚非青年来华访问并参加联欢；将成立中国—亚非合作中心，进一步推进亚非各国交流合作；设立中国—亚非法协国际法交流与研究项目；年内还将举办以弘扬万隆精神为主题的国际研讨会，欢迎各方积极参与。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，中国人民正在按照全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党的战略布局，齐心协力实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标，实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。中国梦同亚非人民及其他各国人民的美好梦想息息相通，不仅造福中国人民，而且造福各国人民。, 中华民族是一个爱好和平的民族，历来崇尚“和为贵”。中国将坚持走和平发展道路，坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚持正确义利观，在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同各国的友好合作，始终做维护世界和平、促进共同发展的坚定力量。无论发展到哪一步，无论国际风云如何变幻，中国都永远做发展中国家的可靠朋友和真诚伙伴。这是中国对外政策的基础，过去、现在、将来都不会改变。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 按照中国人的说法，每60年是一个纪年循环。亚非合作走过了60个春秋，正来到一个新的起点上。回首过去60年，中国同亚非国家风雨同舟、和衷共济，相互关系就像长江、梭罗河、尼罗河水一样奔流不息。展望未来，我们应该弘扬万隆精神，共同实现亚非振兴梦想，为亚非人民带来更多福祉，为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社雅加达4月22日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年04月23日 02 版）, ]",习近平在亚非领导人会议上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/26890358
27,117,"[, Dear President Solis, Dear President Correa, Dear President Maduro, Dear Prime Minister Christi, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Everyone it is good! Everyone is coming from afar, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to my friends! This time, representatives of the member states of the Community of Latin America gathered in Beijing to attend the first ministerial meeting of the China-Latin America Forum, a grand event in the history of China-Latin America relations, which brought a warm atmosphere to Longdong's Beijing. The convening of the first ministerial meeting of the China-Latin America Forum marked the transformation of the overall cooperation between the two sides from vision to reality. The theme of this meeting is ""New Platform, New Starting Point, New Opportunities-Working Together to Promote China-Latin America Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership"", reflecting the characteristics of China-Latin America Forum and the expectations of both parties for overall cooperation. , I believe that this meeting will surely achieve fruitful results, send a positive signal to the world to deepen China-Latin America cooperation and join hands in development, and have an important and far-reaching impact on promoting South-South cooperation and world prosperity and progress. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Half a year ago, I held a landmark meeting with leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries in Brasilia. The two sides decided to establish a comprehensive cooperative partnership of equality, mutual benefit and common development, and formally established the China-Latin America Forum, which conforms to peace, The trend of the times in development, cooperation and win-win is a pioneering work in the history of China-Latin America relations. Over the past six months, China and Latin America have taken the Joint Statement of the Brasilia Meeting of Chinese and Latin American Leaders as a guide to work together to build sincere political mutual trust, win-win cooperation in economy and trade, mutual learning in humanities, and close cooperation in international affairs The five-in-one new pattern of China-Latin America relations that promotes overall cooperation and bilateral relations and promotes mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields. China-Latin America relations are showing a new day of prosperity. ,-Political mutual trust has been further improved. The two sides maintain high-level exchanges and exchanges at all levels, and have frank and in-depth dialogues on issues related to their core interests and major concerns, such as the road of development, governance, foreign policy, etc., with mutual understanding deepening and strategic consensus expanding. ——Pragmatic cooperation is further expanded. Within the framework of “1+3+6” pragmatic cooperation advocated by China, the two sides actively formulate cooperation plans for the next five years, launching the three engines of trade, investment and financial cooperation at full speed, energy resources, infrastructure construction, agriculture, manufacturing, technological innovation, and information technology A number of major cooperation projects in six areas have been or are being formed. , ——People's cultural exchanges are further intensified The exchanges of legislative institutions, political parties and localities between the two sides are endless. Cooperation in the fields of science and technology, education, culture and tourism is flourishing. The friendship between the peoples of the two sides continues to deepen. China's ""Latin America fever"" and Latin America's ""China fever"" continue to heat up. -International cooperation has been further strengthened. The two sides strengthen coordination and cooperation on major issues such as global governance, sustainable development and climate change within the framework of international organizations and multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, APEC, the G20, and the Group of 77. The strategic significance of China-Latin America cooperation And the international influence is increasingly prominent. ——The overall cooperation is further promoted. The two sides completed the preparations for the first ministerial meeting of the China-Latin America Forum in just half a year, and actively discussed from the aspects of political design, pragmatic cooperation, and mechanism building, brainstorming ideas, and building consensus to create a good start for the overall cooperation between China and Latin America. Laid a good foundation. The comprehensive and rapid development of China-Latin America relations is due to the fact that both sides have a more consistent understanding of the world’s development trends, more firm confidence in the development prospects of China-Latin America relations, a clearer consensus on mutual development opportunities, and a stronger desire to build a community of shared destiny between China and Latin America. This is in the common interest of our two parties and is also conducive to peace and development in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and the world. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The world today is a world of development and transformation, a world of new opportunities and challenges, an international system and an in-depth adjustment of the international order, and a world in which the international forces are changing in a direction that is conducive to peace and development. , A large number of developing countries and emerging market countries have developed rapidly. Through South-South cooperation, they have mutually transmitted power, strengthened their own strength and independent development capabilities, injected new momentum into the world economy during the post-international financial crisis, and also strongly promoted the international order. To develop in a more just and reasonable direction. It is the right time for China and Latin America to go hand in hand and deepen cooperation. The total land area of ​​China and Latin American and Caribbean countries accounts for one-fifth of the world’s total land area, the total population accounts for one-third of the world’s total population, and the total economy accounts for one-eighth of the world’s total economy. This is a huge advantage and precious resource for the comprehensive and in-depth development of China-Latin America relations. , China-Latin America Forum isFirst, the total economic volume accounts for one-eighth of the world's total economic volume. This is a huge advantage and precious resource for the comprehensive and in-depth development of China-Latin America relations. The China-Latin America Forum is a new thing. It is like a tender seedling emerging from the ground. To grow into a towering tree, it requires careful cultivation by both parties. At this meeting, the member states of China and the Latin American Community will conduct in-depth discussions on the overall cooperation between the two sides and the construction of the China-Latin America Forum, and through the ""Beijing Declaration of the First Ministerial Conference of China-Latin America Forum"", ""China and Latin American and Caribbean Countries Cooperation Planning (2015-2019)"", ""China-Latin America Forum Mechanism Setting and Operation Rules"" three achievement documents. The ""Beijing Declaration"" will focus on reflecting the political consensus of the two sides on advancing the comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Latin America, determine the overall direction of the overall cooperation and forum construction, and clarify the guiding principles for the two parties to deepen cooperation. The ""Cooperation Plan"" will determine the key areas and specific measures for the overall cooperation between China and Latin America in the next five years, covering politics and security, trade and investment finance, infrastructure construction, energy resources, industry, agriculture, science and technology and humanities. The ""Rules for the Establishment and Operation of China-Latin America Forum Mechanism"" aims to establish rules and regulations for the forum. It will clarify the coordination and cooperation mechanisms such as the ministerial meeting, the China-Latin America ""troika"" regular dialogue, and the China-Latin America National Coordinator Meeting. Provide institutional guarantee for the implementation of political consensus and cooperation planning between the two sides. , I am glad to see that a series of cooperation initiatives I put forward during the meeting between Chinese and Latin American leaders last July are being actively implemented. Among them, the US$20 billion China-Latin America infrastructure loan, the US$10 billion preferential loan and the US$5 billion China-Latin America cooperation fund have been or are about to start substantial operations, and the US$50 million China-Latin America agricultural cooperation special fund has begun Provide financial support for cooperative projects. Relevant Chinese departments have begun to implement the provision of 6,000 scholarships and 6,000 training places to China to members of the Latin American Community within five years, as well as the plan to invite 1,000 leaders of Latin American political parties to visit China and the “Bridge of the Future”. Personnel training plan. The China-Latin America Science and Technology Partnership Program initiated by China, the China-Latin America Young Scientists Exchange Program, and the work related to the 2016 China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year are also actively advancing. China welcomes the active participation of the member countries of the Community of Latin America in the aforementioned cooperation projects. Taking this opportunity, I would like to make a few comments on the future development of the China-Latin America Forum. , First, adhere to the principle of equality in cooperation. ""The ruler is shorter and the inch is longer."" China and the member states of the Latin American Community are equal members of the big family of China-Latin America Forum, regardless of size, strength, wealth and wealth. Everyone should adhere to the concepts of friendly consultation, joint construction, and sharing of results, taking into account the interests and concerns of all parties, consolidating consensus to the greatest extent, and laying a solid political foundation for cooperation. Second, adhere to the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation goal. The China-Latin America Forum, as an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism between China and Latin American Community members, covers a wide range of fields such as politics, economy and trade, humanities, society, science and technology. Both parties should firmly grasp the theme of common development, strengthen the forum mechanism construction, plan the overall blueprint for cooperation, strive for early harvest, achieve the ""1 plus 1 is greater than 2"" effect, and ensure the sustainable development of the forum. , Third, adhere to a flexible and pragmatic way of cooperation. China maintains that the overall cooperation between China and Latin America is in parallel with the bilateral cooperation between China and the member states of the Latin American Community. The two complement and complement each other. All parties can jointly agree on key areas of cooperation and cooperation projects within the framework of the China-Latin America Forum and the sub-forums in related fields, and carry out various forms of cooperation through bilateral and multilateral channels to achieve complementary advantages. Fourth, adhere to an open and inclusive spirit of cooperation. Cooperation within the framework of the China-Latin America Forum must fully consider the different interests of the parties concerned and take care of each other's comfort. We welcome the active participation of Latin American and Caribbean regional organizations and multilateral institutions in China-Latin America overall cooperation. The China-Latin America Forum is not only conducive to solidarity and cooperation between the two sides and South-South cooperation, but will also make positive contributions to the promotion of world development and prosperity. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Latin America and the Caribbean have great resources and unique development conditions. It is one of the most promising emerging regions. In recent years, Latin America has maintained a good momentum of stable development. Under the guidance of regional organizations such as the Latin American Community, new progress has been made in joint self-reliance and integration, and overall strength and international influence have continued to increase. Latin American and Caribbean countries actively promote diversified diplomacy and attach more importance to the development of friendly and cooperative relations with Asia-Pacific countries including China, which provides greater space for the comprehensive and in-depth development of China-Latin America relations. At present, the Chinese people are striving to build a well-off society in an all-round way and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. People in Latin America and the Caribbean are also striving to realize the Latin American dream of unity, cooperation and development. The common dream and common pursuit have closely linked China and Latin America. , China adheres to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, adheres to the path of peaceful development, and adheres to mutual benefitThe same pursuit has closely linked both China and Latin America. , China adheres to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, adheres to the path of peaceful development, adheres to the open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, adheres to and actively practices the correct concept of justice and benefit, stresses faith, values ​​love, promotes justice, and establishes morality. The common development of the vast number of developing countries is closely integrated, and they are committed to establishing a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation. Now, China's economic development has entered a new normal, and it will continue to maintain medium and high growth in the next period. In the next five years, China will import more than US$10 trillion in commodities, overseas investment will exceed US$500 billion, and outbound tourism will exceed 500 million. This will provide countries in the world, including Latin America and the Caribbean, with more market opportunities, growth opportunities, investment opportunities, and cooperation opportunities. We must work together to achieve the goal of reaching US$500 billion in trade between China and Latin America and US$250 billion in direct investment stocks in Latin America within 10 years. , China and Latin America have designed a beautiful logo for the forum. It is shaped like a pair of peace pigeons surrounding it, and it is like two hands clasped tightly, symbolizing the close cooperation between China and Latin America and flying high.

28,142,"[, Dear Premier Li Xianlong, Dear Vice Premier Zhang Zhixian, Dear President Chen Zhuquan, Dear Director Wang Gengwu, Teachers, Classmates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Hello everyone! 　　I am very pleased to come to the National University of Singapore and use the platform of ""Singapore Lecture"" to meet fellow students and friends from all walks of life. This year is the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and New Zealand. I am honored to pay a state visit to Singapore with the reputation of ""garden country"" at the invitation of President Chen Qingyan. , 　　 The National University of Singapore has a long history of 110 years and is a well-known university in Asia and the world. Singaporean leaders such as Mr. Li Guangyao, President Chen Qingyan, Mr. Nadan and Mr. Wu Zuodong are all NUS alumni. It can be said that there are a lot of talents and talents here. Your school advocates the ""wallless culture"" of ""talent without wall"", ""concept without wall"", ""think without wall"", and ""spirit without wall"", which embodies Singapore's innovative spirit and openness and tolerance. This is an important reason for the success of your school and even your country. , 　　 This year is the 50th anniversary of the founding of Singapore. For half a century, the Singaporean people have become stubborn and indignant. With hard work and wisdom, Singapore has become one of the most developed countries in Asia, and it has become an important economic and financial center, shipping center, and refining center in the world. National development has achieved world-wide development. Eye-catching achievements. Singapore’s achievements vividly explain the principle of “relying on the grain of people to fill the warehouse, and relying on the sky and rice tanks”. We sincerely congratulate the people of Singapore on their success. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 China and Singapore are friendly neighbors with a lot of water and friendly exchanges have a long history. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, a famous Chinese navigator, set sail and made many trips to Singapore. In the Singapore Maritime Museum, there is a Zheng Hebao ship reproduced in its original size to commemorate this great event. At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, many people from Guangdong and Fujian in China sailed across the ocean to make a living in Nanyang, bringing Chinese culture and technology, and sowing the seeds of China-Singapore friendship. , 　　 In 1978, Mr. Deng Xiaoping visited Singapore, which opened the prelude to China-New Zealand friendly cooperation in the new period. At that time, China was exploring a new path of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, and actively exploring the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the leadership of Mr. Li Guangyao, Singapore has both oriental values ​​and international vision, and has embarked on a development path that conforms to Singapore's national conditions. After witnessing the economic achievements created by Singapore, Mr. Deng Xiaoping said that China should learn from Singapore. Singapore’s practice provides a valuable reference for China to solve some of the problems in reform and development. China’s development has also brought huge opportunities for Singapore’s development. , 　　 Now, China and New Zealand have deepened political mutual trust and deepened pragmatic cooperation. The two intergovernmental cooperation projects in Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-City have been successfully promoted. The third intergovernmental cooperation project on the theme of modern interconnection and modern service economy will soon be settled in Chongqing, China. China is Singapore's largest trading partner, and Singapore is China's largest source of investment and an important investment destination. The financial cooperation between the two countries is booming, and Singapore has become one of the important RMB offshore trading centers. The two sides have achieved fruitful cooperation in the fields of science and technology, environmental protection, education and humanities, and social governance. The development of China-Singapore relations over the past 25 years has closely matched the development strategies of the two countries, China's development direction and Singapore's unique advantages, and has embarked on a road of cooperation that advances with the times. , 　　 On the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Singapore, we unanimously agreed to define the relationship between China and Singapore as an all-round cooperative partnership advancing with the times. I believe that with the joint efforts of the people of China and Singapore, China-Singapore relations will usher in new and greater development. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 China and Southeast Asia are connected by mountains and rivers, and their blood is connected, and there is a history of communication that can be tested in words for more than 2000 years. Chinese civilization and Southeast Asian civilization have learned from each other for thousands of years. Since ancient times, China has emphasized peace and difference. The Chinese culture pursues benevolence and virtues, humility, self-examination, sensitivity and learning, and perfection. The characters of loyalty in Chinese literary works such as ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" and ""Water Margin"" are also respected by the people of Southeast Asia. Food, music, architecture, and painting in Southeast Asia have also influenced Chinese folklore.　　 Since modern times, China and Southeast Asian countries have encouraged and supported each other in the process of national independence and national liberation. They have inspired each other and worked together in the course of economic and social development. They have responded to the Asian financial crisis, the international financial crisis and the Indian Ocean tsunami, During the Wenchuan Earthquake in China, we helped each other and helped each other. Today, China is working with Southeast Asian countries to write their own development historyDuring the ocean tsunami and the Wenchuan earthquake in China, we watched and helped each other. Today, China is working with Southeast Asian countries to write a new chapter in its own development history.　　Since the 1960s, Southeast Asian countries have created ASEAN and embarked on the road of unity and self-improvement. In the past half a century, they have achieved a leap from turbulence and poverty to stable development, becoming a regional and international arena An important force to promote development and deepen cooperation. In its own development and foreign relations, ASEAN has formed a unique ""ASEAN way"", emphasizing mutual respect, consensus, and taking care of the comfort of all parties, providing a useful reference for regional countries to develop relations, deepen cooperation, and promote integration. At the end of this year, ASEAN is about to build a community, which is the first subregional community in Asia. China will firmly develop friendly cooperation with ASEAN, firmly support the development and growth of ASEAN, firmly support the building of the ASEAN community, and firmly support ASEAN to play a leading role in regional cooperation in East Asia. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 China has always placed the periphery as the most important diplomatic position, and regards promoting the peace, stability, and development of the periphery as its own responsibility. China promotes the development of the global governance system in a more just and reasonable direction, promotes the democratization of international relations, promotes the establishment of a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation, and promotes the building of a community of shared future for mankind. , 　　 China insists on being good neighbors and partners, adhering to the neighboring foreign policy of good-neighborliness, security and prosperity, adhering to the concept of sincere and friendly neighboring diplomacy, adhering to a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable Asia The concept of security is committed to building a closer China-ASEAN community of shared destiny and promoting the building of a community of shared destiny in Asia. , 　　The idea of ​​peaceful development is the inherent gene of Chinese culture, stressing faith and repairing harmony, and harmony of nations are the basic connotations of China's surrounding diplomacy. Since modern times, the invasion of foreign enemies and internal wars have brought huge disasters to the Chinese people. The Chinese people know the value of peace, they will never give up their determination and desire to maintain peace, and will never impose their own suffering on others. China's prosperity is the trend, but national power must be hegemony is not the law of history. Since ancient times, China has advocated ""strength is not stubborn and weakness, wealth is not insulting the poor"". Some people pretend to be ""China threat theory"", either because they don't understand China's history, culture, and real policies, or because of a misunderstanding and prejudice, or for some ulterior purpose. China’s adherence to the path of peaceful development and its independent foreign policy of peace are not an expedient measure, but our strategic choice and solemn commitment.　　Since modern times, China has experienced over a century of poverty, weakness, and turbulence. We know the importance of development and stability more than anyone else. China's development process has received help and support from neighboring countries, and China's development achievements have also been shared by neighboring countries. China is willing to more closely integrate its own development with the development of neighboring countries. It welcomes neighboring countries to take China's ""express"" and ""free ride"" development, so that China's development achievements can benefit its neighbors and let everyone live a good life together. , 　　 Two years ago, when I visited Central and Southeast Asia, I proposed the idea of ​​building the “Belt and Road” initiative. This is a development initiative, a cooperative initiative, and an open initiative, emphasizing an equal and mutually beneficial way of mutual consultation, joint construction, and sharing. At present, this initiative has gained momentum. China issued a programmatic document of vision and action, more than 60 countries and international organizations expressed an attitude of active participation, China has reached cooperation agreements with many countries, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Agreement has been signed, and the Silk Road Fund has begun to implement specific projects A number of multilateral or bilateral large-scale project cooperation is steadily advancing. The primary partners of the “Belt and Road” initiative are neighboring countries, and the primary beneficiaries are also neighboring countries. We welcome neighboring countries to participate in cooperation, jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”, and work together to realize the vision of peace, development and cooperation. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　The trend of the times is vast and mighty. At present, China's relations with neighboring countries stand at a new historical starting point. Asia is the high ground of world economic development, and its macroeconomic fundamentals are stable and improving. At the same time, it is under the influence of internal and external factors and is under heavy downward pressure. Asian politics, social harmony and social stability are a stable sector in the global landscape. At the same time, security issues are very complex. Non-traditional security challenges such as terrorism, extremism, transnational crime, cybersecurity, and major natural disasters have increased. The policy orientation of the vast majority of Asian countries is to resolve conflicts and differences through consultation and negotiation. At the same time, some countries lack mutual trust and disputes. The interdependence of Asian countries is deepening, the process of regional integration is accelerating, and the path of regional cooperation is different. Security cooperation lags behind economic cooperation for a long time. I need these questionsWith the deepening, the process of regional integration is accelerating, and at the same time, the path of regional cooperation is different, and security cooperation lags behind economic cooperation for a long time. All these problems require us to cope with and solve them together. , 　　 I have been thinking about the plan for China and neighboring countries including Southeast Asia to deepen cooperation and seek common development under the new situation. I would like to put forward some ideas and ideas here. , 　　-joint maintenance and peace. Maintaining peace in Asia is the historical responsibility and shared responsibility of China and neighboring countries. The people of Asian countries should never be enemies, increase mutual trust, jointly protect Asia and peace, and create good conditions for the development of Asian countries and people's peace and contentment. , 　　——In-depth docking development strategy. People of all Asian countries should concentrate on promoting development, improving people's livelihood, helping each other, discovering new driving forces for cooperation from their respective development strategies, planning new cooperation visions, locking in new cooperation achievements, making the ""cake"" of mutually beneficial cooperation for each other's economy Growth provides more momentum. , 　　-Actively develop security cooperation. ""It's not a single thread, it's difficult to be alone."" Asian peoples must practice the Asian security concept, coordinate and promote regional security governance, jointly assume and respond to traditional and non-traditional security issues, insist on peaceful settlement of conflicts and differences through friendly consultations, and insist on development and Equal security and seek mutual respect, mutual trust, convergence and diversification, openness and tolerance, and win-win cooperation among neighboring countries. , 　　——Consolidate the blind date continuously. People in Asian countries should draw nutrients from a long historical civilization, consolidate the collective recognition of Asian values, expand humanities exchanges and cooperation, consolidate the foundation of good-neighborly and friendly social public opinion, and put the traditional concepts of ""harmony"" and ""cooperation"" together. Tao, pass on the fire of cultivation and cooperation for generations. , 　　 For some time, everyone has been concerned about China's policy on the South China Sea issue. What I want to say is that the islands of the South China Sea have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and it is the responsibility of the Chinese government to safeguard their territorial sovereignty and legitimate marine rights and interests. The starting point and ending point of China's South China Sea policy are to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. With the joint efforts of China and the coastal countries of the South China Sea, the situation in the South China Sea is generally peaceful. There is never any problem with freedom of navigation and overflight, and there will be no problems in the future, because first of all, China needs the smooth navigation of the South China Sea. Although some of the southern islands and reefs under China’s sovereignty have been invaded by others, we have always advocated peaceful resolution of the problem. China will insist on resolving relevant disputes through negotiations and consultations on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law with direct parties. We are fully capable and confident to work with ASEAN countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. We welcome countries outside the region to participate in the cause of peace and development in Asia and play an active role in this regard. At present, the most important issue facing Asian governments is how to achieve sustained and rapid development, which requires a peaceful and stable environment. This is the largest convention for countries in the region, and countries outside the region should also understand and respect this and play a constructive role. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 Everyone cares about China's development trend. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has just concluded. The meeting reviewed and approved the proposal to formulate the thirteenth five-year plan for national economic and social development, depicting China's blueprint for the next five years. According to our plan, by 2020, China will be fully built into a well-off society, with GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents doubling from 2010, and achieving the first 100 years of the ""two hundred years"" struggle goal we set Goal. , 　　——In order to achieve this goal, we will adhere to the strategic layout of building a well-off society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepening reforms, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively strictly governing the party, insisting that development is the first priority, focusing on improving development quality and efficiency, and accelerating Form the institutional mechanisms and development methods that lead the new normal of economic development, maintain strategic determination, adhere to steady progress, and coordinate economic development, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction, and party construction. , 　　——In order to achieve this goal, we will firmly establish the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing. Adhering to innovation and development means putting innovation at the core of the overall development of the country, allowing innovation to run through all the work of the country, and making innovation prevail in the whole society. Adhering to coordinated development means focusing on promoting coordinated development of urban and rural areas, promoting coordinated economic and social development, promoting the simultaneous development of new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization. While enhancing the country’s hard power, it also focuses on improving the country’s soft power and continuously enhancing development. Integrity. Adhering to green development means adhering to the basic national policy of saving resources and protecting the environment, adhering to sustainable development, forming a new pattern of harmonious development of man and nature, modernizing construction, and making new contributions to global ecological security. Adhering to open development means pursuing an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win development, with higher developmentDevelop a new pattern of modernization and make new contributions to global ecological security. Adhering to open development means pursuing an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, developing a higher-level open economy, actively participating in global economic governance and public product supply, and building a broad community of interests. Persisting in shared development means insisting on development for the people, development depends on the people, and development achievements are shared by the people, so that all people have a greater sense of gain in the joint construction and shared development, and move steadily in the direction of common prosperity. , 　　-In order to achieve this goal, China should strengthen cooperation with all countries in the world, especially neighboring neighboring countries. Similarly, China's development will bring more development opportunities to the world, especially to neighboring countries. We are willing and expect to share development opportunities with other countries and create a better future for Asia. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 years are like shuttles, time goes by. Looking back on the development of China-Singapore relations, we miss the two great men who created China-Singapore relations, Mr. Deng Xiaoping and Mr. Li Guangyao. When I visited Singapore five years ago, I unveiled the monument to Mr. Deng Xiaoping along the Singapore River with Mr. Li Guangyao. Now that the Si people are dead, their great achievements are always worthy of our memory. , 　　 youth represents hope and the future. What is gratifying is that the tree of China-Singapore friendship and cooperation carefully cultivated by the leaders of the older generations of China, Singapore and the United States has now grown lush and fruitful. The cause of China-Singapore friendship and cooperation requires the inheritance of the younger generation, and the baton of friendship between the two countries requires the younger generation of the two countries to take over and run on. In July of this year, several Singaporean “post-90s” college students participated in the 2015 “Looking at China·Foreign Youth Video Project”. They came to northwest China to record modern China with a lens. They learned and understood through Qinqiang, Lanzhou beef noodles, sheepskin rafts and other elements. Pass on Chinese culture. Two university students who came to China from the National University of Singapore for further studies took a year to photograph the dream stories of 50 local Singaporean people. I believe there are many such cases around the students here. , 　　 hope that the young people of China and Singapore will carry forward the spirit of ""no one knows no one, no one knows no one"", deepen the understanding of each other's national history and culture, deepen the understanding of each other's life pursuit, learn from each other and enhance friendship, The loyal successors, active participants, and dedicated devotees of the new friendship between the Communist Party of China have become the new force in the development of China-Singapore relations. , 　　 teachers, students, ladies, gentlemen! , 　　 Looking to the future, Asia is once again at the forefront of leading historical development. We were born and grew up in Sri Lanka, our future and destiny are maintained in Sri Lanka. China is willing to work with Singapore, with neighboring countries, and with other countries in the world to work together to create a new situation of all-round cooperation and build a beautiful home in Asia. , 　　 Thank you. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, November 7th), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (November 08, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Deepen partnerships and build a better home in

　　大家好！很高兴来到新加坡国立大学，并利用“新加坡讲座”这个平台，同各位同学和各界朋友见面。今年是中新建交25周年，我很荣幸应陈庆炎总统邀请，对有着“花园国家”美誉的新加坡进行国事访问。, 　　新加坡国立大学拥有110年悠久历史，是亚洲乃至世界知名高校。李光耀先生、陈庆炎总统、纳丹先生、吴作栋先生等新加坡领导人都是国大校友。可以说，这里桃李芬芳、人才辈出。贵校倡导“人才不设墙”、“观念不设墙”、“思维不设墙”、“知识不设墙”的“无墙文化”，体现了新加坡创新进取和开放包容精神。这是贵校乃至贵国成功的一个重要原因。, 　　今年是新加坡建国50周年。半个世纪以来，新加坡人民筚路蓝缕、发愤图强，凭借勤劳智慧把新加坡建设成了亚洲最发达的国家之一，成为世界上重要的经济金融中心、航运中心、炼化中心，国家发展取得了举世瞩目的成就。新加坡取得的成就生动诠释了“靠人粮满仓，靠天空米缸”的道理。我们对新加坡人民的成功表示衷心祝贺。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　中国和新加坡是一衣带水的友好邻邦，友好交往源远流长。15世纪初，中国著名航海家郑和扬帆远航，多次到访新加坡。新加坡海事博物馆里有一艘按原尺寸复制的郑和宝船，以纪念这一伟大事件。明末清初，许多来自中国广东、福建的民众漂洋过海到南洋谋生，带来了中华文化和技术，也播下了中新友好的种子。, 　　1978年，邓小平先生访问新加坡，拉开了新时期中新友好合作的序幕。当时的中国正在开拓改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的新路，积极探索中国特色社会主义道路。在李光耀先生带领下，新加坡兼具东方价值观和国际视野，走出了一条符合新加坡国情的发展道路。在目睹新加坡创造的经济成就后，邓小平先生表示，中国要向新加坡学习。新加坡的实践为中国破解改革发展中的一些难题提供了宝贵借鉴，中国发展也为新加坡带来了巨大发展机遇。, 　　现在，中新两国政治互信不断加深，务实合作深入拓展。苏州工业园区、天津生态城两个政府间合作项目成功推进，以现代互联互通和现代服务经济为主题的第三个政府间合作项目即将在中国重庆落户。中国是新加坡最大贸易伙伴，新加坡是中国最大投资来源国和重要投资目的地。两国金融合作方兴未艾，新加坡已经成为重要的人民币离岸交易中心之一。双方在科技环保、教育人文、社会治理等领域合作成果丰硕。中新关系25年来的发展，紧密契合两国发展战略，契合中国发展方向和新加坡独特优势，走出了一条与时俱进的合作之路。, 　　在中新建交25周年之际，我们一致同意将中国和新加坡关系定位确定为与时俱进的全方位合作伙伴关系。我相信，在中新两国人民共同努力下，中新关系必将迎来新的更大的发展。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　中国和东南亚山水相连，血脉相通，有文字可考的交往史长达2000多年。中华文明和东南亚文明千年互鉴共生。中国自古讲求和而不同、敦亲睦邻，同东南亚文化深度契合。中华文化追求的仁爱尚德、谦恭自省、敏而好学、止于至善，《三国演义》、《水浒传》等中国文学作品中人物具备的忠义品质，也是东南亚人民所推崇的。东南亚的饮食、音乐、建筑、绘画等也影响了中国民俗。, 　　近代以来，中国和东南亚国家在国家独立和民族解放的进程中彼此激励、相互支持，在经济社会发展的历程中相互启迪、通力合作，在应对亚洲金融危机、国际金融危机和抗击印度洋海啸、中国汶川特大地震中守望相助、和衷共济。时至今日，中国正同东南亚国家一道，书写着自身发展的历史新篇章。, 　　上世纪60年代起，东南亚国家创建东盟，走上了联合自强之路，并在近半个世纪中风雨兼程，实现了从动荡贫弱到稳定发展的跨越，成为地区和国际舞台上维护和平、促进发展、深化合作的一支重要力量。东盟在自身发展和对外交往中，形成了独具特色的“东盟方式”，强调相互尊重、协商一致、照顾各方舒适度，为地区国家发展关系、深化合作、推进一体化提供了有益借鉴。今年年底，东盟即将建成共同体，这是亚洲地区第一个次区域共同体。中国将坚定发展同东盟的友好合作，坚定支持东盟发展壮大，坚定支持东盟共同体建设，坚定支持东盟在东亚区域合作中发挥主导作用。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　中国始终将周边置于外交全局的首要位置，视促进周边和平、稳定、发展为己任。中国推动全球治理体系朝着更加公正合理方向发展，推动国际关系民主化，推动建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，推动建设人类命运共同体，都是从周边先行起步。, 　　中国坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴，坚持奉行睦邻、安邻、富邻的周边外交政策，坚持践行亲诚惠容的周边外交理念，坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的亚洲安全观，致力于构建更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体，推动建设亚洲命运共同体。, 　　和平发展思想是中华文化的内在基因，讲信修睦、协和万邦是中国周边外交的基本内涵。近代以来，外敌入侵、内部战乱曾给中国人民带来巨大灾难。中国人民深知和平的宝贵，绝不会放弃维护和平的决心和愿望，绝不会把自身曾经遭遇的苦难强加于他人。中国繁荣昌盛是趋势所在，但国强必霸不是历史定律。中国自古倡导“强不执弱，富不侮贫”，深知“国虽大，好战必亡”的道理。一些人渲染“中国威胁论”，这或者是对中国历史文化和现实政策不了解，或者是出于一种误解和偏见，或者是有着某种不可告人的目的。中国坚持走和平发展道路，坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，不是权宜之计，而是我们的战略选择和郑重承诺。, 　　近代以来，中国经历了长达一个多世纪的积贫积弱、风雨飘摇的年代，我们比谁都懂得发展的重要、稳定的可贵。中国的发展进程得到周边国家帮助和支持，中国发展成果也为周边国家所分享。中国愿意把自身发展同周边国家发展更紧密地结合起来，欢迎周边国家搭乘中国发展“快车”、“便车”，让中国发展成果更多惠及周边，让大家一起过上好日子。, 　　两年前，我在访问中亚和东南亚时，提出建设“一带一路”的设想。这是发展的倡议、合作的倡议、开放的倡议，强调的是共商、共建、共享的平等互利方式。目前，这个倡议已经形成势头。中国发布了愿景与行动的纲领性文件，60多个国家和国际组织表达积极参与的态度，中国同很多国家达成了合作协议，亚洲基础设施投资银行协定已经签署，丝路基金已经着手实施具体项目，一批多边或双边大项目合作正稳步推进。“一带一路”倡议的首要合作伙伴是周边国家，首要受益对象也是周边国家。我们欢迎周边国家参与到合作中来，共同推进“一带一路”建设，携手实现和平、发展、合作的愿景。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　时代潮流，浩浩荡荡。当前，中国同周边国家关系站在了新的历史起点上。亚洲是世界经济发展高地，宏观经济基本面稳定向好，同时受内外因素影响，承受了较大下行压力。亚洲政通人和、社会稳定，是全球格局中的稳定板块，同时安全问题十分复杂，恐怖主义、极端主义、跨国犯罪、网络安全、重大自然灾害等非传统安全挑战增多。亚洲绝大多数国家的政策取向是通过协商谈判处理矛盾分歧，同时一些国家互信不足、时有纷争。亚洲国家相互依存日益加深，地区一体化进程不断加速，同时区域合作路径不一，安全合作长期滞后于经济合作。这些问题都需要我们共同应对和破解。, 　　我一直在思考新形势下中国同包括东南亚在内的周边国家深化合作、共谋发展的大计，愿在此提出一些想法和主张。, 　　——共同维护和平安宁。维护亚洲和平是中国同周边国家的历史责任和共同担当。亚洲各国人民要永不为敌、增进互信，共同守护亚洲和平安宁，为亚洲各国发展和人民安居乐业创造良好条件。, 　　——深入对接发展战略。亚洲各国人民要聚精会神推动发展、改善民生，互帮互助，从各自发展战略中发掘新的合作动力，规划新的合作愿景，锁定新的合作成果，做大互利合作的“蛋糕”，为彼此经济增长提供更多动能。, 　　——积极开展安全合作。“单丝不线，孤掌难鸣。”亚洲各国人民要践行亚洲安全观，协调推进地区安全治理，共同担当和应对传统和非传统安全问题，坚持以和平方式通过友好协商解决矛盾分歧，坚持发展和安全并重，共谋互尊互信、聚同化异、开放包容、合作共赢的邻国相处之道。, 　　——不断巩固人缘相亲。亚洲各国人民要从悠久的历史文明中汲取养分，凝聚对亚洲价值的集体认同，拓展人文交流合作，夯实睦邻友好的社会民意基础，把“和”、“合”的传统理念付诸彼此相处之道，把修睦合作的薪火世代传承下去。, 　　一段时间以来，大家都关心中国在南海问题上的政策。我要说的是，南海诸岛自古以来就是中国领土，维护自身的领土主权和正当合理的海洋权益，是中国政府必须承担的责任。中国南海政策的出发点和落脚点都是维护南海地区和平稳定。在中国和南海沿岸国共同努力下，南海局势总体是和平的，航行和飞越自由从来没有问题，将来也不会有问题，因为首先中国最需要南海航行通畅。尽管中国拥有主权的一些南海岛礁被他人侵占，但我们始终主张通过和平谈判方式解决问题。中国将坚持同直接当事国在尊重历史事实的基础上，根据国际法，通过谈判和协商解决有关争议，我们完全有能力，也有信心同东盟国家一道，维护好南海地区的和平稳定。我们欢迎域外国家参与亚洲和平与发展事业，为此发挥积极作用。当前，亚洲各国政府面临的最重要课题是如何实现持续快速发展，这需要一个和平稳定的环境。这是地区国家的最大公约数，域外国家也应该理解和尊重这一点并发挥建设性作用。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　大家关心中国的发展走向。中共十八届五中全会刚刚闭幕，会议审议通过了关于制定国民经济和社会发展第十三个五年规划的建议，描绘了中国未来5年发展蓝图。按照我们的规划，到2020年，中国将全面建成小康社会，国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，实现我们确定的“两个一百年”奋斗目标的第一个百年奋斗目标。, 　　——为了实现这个目标，我们将坚持全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党的战略布局，坚持发展是第一要务，以提高发展质量和效益为中心，加快形成引领经济发展新常态的体制机制和发展方式，保持战略定力，坚持稳中求进，统筹推进经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设、生态文明建设和党的建设。, 　　——为了实现这个目标，我们将牢固树立创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念。坚持创新发展，就是要把创新摆在国家发展全局的核心位置，让创新贯穿国家一切工作，让创新在全社会蔚然成风。坚持协调发展，就是要重点促进城乡区域协调发展，促进经济社会协调发展，促进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化同步发展，在增强国家硬实力的同时注重提升国家软实力，不断增强发展整体性。坚持绿色发展，就是要坚持节约资源和保护环境的基本国策，坚持可持续发展，形成人与自然和谐发展现代化建设新格局，为全球生态安全作出新贡献。坚持开放发展，就是要奉行互利共赢的开放战略，发展更高层次的开放型经济，积极参与全球经济治理和公共产品供给，构建广泛的利益共同体。坚持共享发展，就是要坚持发展为了人民、发展依靠人民、发展成果由人民共享，使全体人民在共建共享发展中有更多获得感，朝着共同富裕方向稳步前进。, 　　——为了实现这个目标，中国要加强同世界各国特别是周边邻国的合作。同样，中国发展也将为世界特别是周边国家带来更多发展机遇。我们愿意也期待同各国分享发展机遇，共创亚洲美好未来。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　岁月如梭，光阴荏苒。回顾中新关系发展历程，我们倍加怀念缔造中新关系的两位伟人，邓小平先生、李光耀先生。5年前我访问新加坡时，同李光耀先生一起在新加坡河畔为邓小平先生纪念碑揭幕。如今斯人已逝，他们的丰功伟绩永远值得我们缅怀。, 　　青年代表着希望、代表着未来。令人欣慰的是，中新老一辈领导人精心培育的中新友好合作之树如今已经枝繁叶茂、硕果累累。中新友好合作事业需要青年一代传承发扬，两国友谊的接力棒需要两国年轻一代接过来、跑下去。今年7月，几名新加坡“90后”大学生参加了2015“看中国·外国青年影像计划”，他们来到中国西北，用镜头记录现代中国，通过秦腔、兰州牛肉面、羊皮筏子等元素了解和传递中华文化。从中国来到新加坡国立大学深造的两名大学生则用一年时间拍摄了50个新加坡当地人物的梦想故事。相信在座的同学们身边还有很多这样的事例。, 　　希望中新两国青年发扬“不患人之不己知，患不知人也”的精神，加深对彼此国家历史文化的了解，加深对彼此人生追求的了解，互学互鉴，增进友谊，共当中新友谊的忠实继承者、积极参与者、热心奉献者，成为中新关系发展的生力军。, 　　老师们、同学们、女士们、先生们！, 　　展望未来，亚洲再次站到了引领历史发展的前列。我们生于斯、长于斯，前途命运维系于斯。中国愿同新加坡一道，愿同周边国家一道，愿同世界各国一道，携手开创全方位合作新局面，共建亚洲美好家园。, 　　谢谢各位。, 　　（新华社新加坡11月7日电）, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2015年11月08日 02 版）, ]",习近平：深化合作伙伴关系

29,143,"[, Dear Mayor Ye Yalun, Dear Prince Andrew,, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Hello everyone! I am very happy to meet you in the City of London, and I believe we will have a pleasant evening together. , This time, I will pay a state visit to the UK at the invitation of Queen Elizabeth II, in order to promote greater development of China-UK comprehensive strategic partnership and better benefit the peoples of the two countries. , First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my personal name, I would like to thank the British royal family, government and people for their warm reception to us, to all of you here, to the friendly British people, to the long-term commitment to Sino-British cooperation and Sino-British Sincere greetings and good wishes from all walks of life in the friendly cause! , 21 years ago, I visited the UK, and I went to London, Oxford, Glasgow, Edinburgh and other places to experience the UK’s long history, unique traditions, and vitality. When I came to the UK again, I saw the towering Big Ben and the river Thames, and I felt like ""I don't know where it is from other countries"". At this moment, memories of Britain kept flashing in my mind. I thought of the British bourgeois revolution, industrial revolution, charter movement, Normandy landing, thought of Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, Bernard Shaw, thought of Bacon, Clen Will, Churchill, thought of Thomas Moore, John Locke, Adam Smith, Darwin, Arnold Toynbee, Needham, thought of ""Two Cities"", ""Wudu Orphans"", ""Jane Love"", "" ""Robinson Crusoe"", thinking of Sherlock Holmes, of course, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels..., in the long historical process, the Chinese people and the British people have created a splendid civilization, the progress of human civilization Had a profound impact. China is the hometown of tea, and the United Kingdom has brought the afternoon tea culture to the extreme. The works of Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Jane Austin, Dickens and others let Chinese people feel the charm of traditional British literature, ""Cat"", 007 series movies, ""Harry Potter"", ""Sherlock Sherlock"", "" Downton Manor and other contemporary British literary and artistic works are also loved by Chinese audiences. Football stars such as Beckham, Manchester United, Arsenal and other clubs have many fans in China. There are more than 150,000 Chinese students studying in the UK; Chinese is popular in the British Isles, and more than 600 primary and secondary schools have set up Chinese courses. This year is the first Chinese-English exchange year in history, and the exchanges between the artists of the two countries are splendid. All this proves that Sino-British friendship has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the long-term development of bilateral relations has a solid public opinion and social foundation. , London is a historical and cultural city in the world, and the financial city is the heart of London, where you can feel the strong pulse of modern British financial development and economic beating. On this square mile of land, it manages more than 4 trillion US dollars of global assets, creating 3% of the UK’s GDP, all five major Chinese banks have established branches, and the London offshore RMB market is booming. The RMB Money Market Exchange Fund is also listed on the London Stock Exchange. It can be said that the Financial City is both a microcosm of China-UK deep cooperation and a vivid interpretation of global openness. In today's world, openness, tolerance and diversity are the keynotes. In the home garden of human civilization in the 21st century, although countries have different histories, cultures, and systems, they should all live in harmony and treat each other as equals. They should respect each other, learn from each other, and discard all arrogance and prejudice. Only in this way can all countries develop together and share prosperity. In today's world, interconnection and interdependence are the major trends. With the high flow of commodities, funds, information, and talents, no matter neighbors or distant ties, no matter big or small countries, no matter developed or developing countries, an interest community and a community of destiny are increasingly being formed that blend interests, share safety and security. Cold war thinking and camp confrontation no longer meet the requirements of the times. In today's world, peace, development, cooperation and win-win are the main themes. The world economic recovery process is tortuous, international and regional hotspots are emerging one after another, and global challenges such as terrorism, cybersecurity, climate change, and major infectious diseases remain severe. Facing unprecedented challenges, no country can be alone. Countries around the world need to work together and coordinate actions in a responsible spirit. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In today's complex and ever-changing world situation, China's development has attracted increasing attention from all parties. For a period of time, there have been various opinions and evaluations on China internationally, including ""singing more"", ""singing empty"", and ""singing down"", with praise, understanding, confidence, confusion, doubts, and misunderstandings. , Of course, to understand and understand a people with more than 5000 years of civilization, 56 ethnic groups, and a population of more than 1.3 billionConfidence, doubt, misunderstanding and misunderstanding. Of course, to understand and understand a big country with more than 5,000 years of civilization, 56 ethnic groups, and a population of more than 1.3 billion is certainly not an easy task, but the best judgment is based on facts, and don’t look at the flowers in fog month. Here, I would like to talk about some of the issues that interest you most. First, the Chinese people are following the path chosen by history. Road determines fate. A country and a nation can only achieve its own development goals if it finds a way that suits its conditions. Over the past 37 years of reform and opening up, China’s economy has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 10%, becoming the world’s second largest economy, with more than 600 million people out of poverty, and a per capita GDP of more than $7,000. China has spent decades traversing the development process that developed countries have traveled for hundreds of years. This fully shows that the Chinese people are on the right path. , History is the source of reality. After modern times, China has suffered from war and turbulence, and has suffered for more than a century. More than 100 years ago, the Chinese people began to ""look at the world with their eyes open"" and strive to find a way to save the country and the people. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution, went to England to study. After experiencing failed attempts at constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, and presidential system, China finally chose the path of socialism. This is the choice of history and the choice of the people. As the British philosopher Russell said: ""Only Chinese people know themselves best"", ""Only the solutions they slowly figure out are long-term solutions."", The Chinese nation has always focused on reform and innovation. Chinese socialism is not a dogma in textbooks, not a rigid and rigid commandment, but a living body that is constantly changing in practice. We have continuously improved in practice and constantly changed in development, forming and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is to build a socialist market economy, democratic politics, advanced culture, harmonious society, and ecological civilization, promote the comprehensive development of people, promote social fairness and justice, and gradually realize the common prosperity of all people. , ""Performance does not need to be the same, and the period is sufficient; governance does not need to be the same, and the period benefits the people."" There is no universal development path in the world. Only the development path that can continue to benefit the people is the most vital. Second, the Chinese people want a better life. At present, the entire Chinese people are striving to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We have established the goal of ""two hundred years"", which is to achieve GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents double by 2010 compared with 2010, to build a well-off society in an all-round way; to build a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious society by the middle of this century Modern country. We are well aware that China is still the largest developing country in the world. According to Chinese standards, 70 million people in China have not escaped poverty. According to UN standards, China still has about 200 million people living below the poverty line. To make life better, the Chinese people also need to make long-term efforts. The Chinese dream is a dream of the Chinese people in pursuit of happiness, and it is also closely linked to the beautiful dreams of people of all countries. China's development is bound to be in the world's development trend, and it will inject more vitality and bring more opportunities for the common development of all countries in the world. China is a responsible country. During the international financial crisis, we worked together with the international community to play the role of ""stabilizer"" and ""engine"" for the recovery of the world economy. Currently, the contribution rate of China's economic growth to global economic growth is still close to 30%. We are accelerating the promotion of new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization, developing capital markets, and raising the level of an open economy. China’s import and export, foreign investment, and foreign investment will be more balanced. China is vigorously advancing the strategy of innovation-driven development. Joseph Needham summarized the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology development in his huge book ""History of Chinese Science and Technology."" China must keep up with the new technological revolution and strive to create first-class scientific and technological achievements. It is expected that China will import more than US$10 trillion worth of goods in the next five years, and its foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and there will be more than 500 million outbound visits, tourism and shopping. This is undoubtedly a major benefit to the development of the world economy. China is willing to work with the international community, including the United Kingdom, to unleash more potential and achieve better development with tangible actions. Third, the Chinese people want a world of peace and development. Ideas such as harmony for value, harmony for difference, Concord and Wanbang have been handed down from generation to generation in China, and the genes of peace are deeply rooted in the blood of the Chinese nation. After modern times, the Chinese people have experienced hardships, so they cherish peace more; China is committed to development, so it needs peace more; China looks forward to a better future, so it loves peace more. China adheres to the path of peaceful development and does not accept the logic of ""national power must be hegemony."" No one, anything, or reason can shake China's determination and will to take the path of peaceful development. , China Advocacy InternationalThe logic of ""power must be hegemony."" No one, anything, any reason can shake China's determination and will to take the path of peaceful development. China advocates the international community to jointly build a community of shared future for mankind, and establish a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core. , Adhere to the democratization of international relations, adhere to the correct view of justice and benefit, and persist in peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation. We will work with countries around the world to safeguard world peace, safeguard fairness and justice, and promote common prosperity., China’s Development benefits from the international community, and will certainly give back to the international family. China has always been an advocate of international cooperation and an active participant in international multilateralism, and will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win. As China’s strength rises, We will gradually assume more responsibilities within our power and strive to contribute Chinese wisdom and Chinese power to promote world economic growth and improve global governance. China’s development will not sacrifice the interests of other countries, but will only enhance common interests. China will work with other countries Mountain roads and bridges across the river. The roads in the world will only become wider and wider when there are more people walking on them., Ladies, gentlemen, friends!, China and Britain are thousands of miles apart, but they are still close. China Seeing Britain as an important partner and sincere friend. Since the end of the Second World War, Sino-British relations have generally been at the forefront of China-West relations. In recent years, the relations and cooperation between the two countries have made great progress and are accelerating on a stable and healthy fast lane. The UK has become China's second largest trading partner and investment destination country within the EU, and the largest RMB trading center outside Hong Kong. China is the UK's second largest trading partner outside the EU and the premier investment destination in Asia. From food, clothing and housing to Energy, infrastructure, finance, scientific research, and all-round pragmatic cooperation between China and Britain have already “flew into ordinary people’s homes” and have continued to benefit the people of both countries., More than 30 years ago, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and British Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher used extraordinary strategies The vision has enabled the two countries to creatively solve the Hong Kong issue and set an example of peacefully solving the problems left over by history. Today, more than 30 years later, the UK first applied for membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank among major Western countries. I look forward to the UK’s continued To be a model of leading trends, openness and inclusiveness in cooperation in various fields in China, to become a leader in cooperation between the West and China, and to practice ""China's strongest supporter in the Western world"" with practical actions. ——We must stick to long-term and strategic vision To firmly grasp the overall situation and the general trend of the relations between the two countries, continue to enrich the connotation of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the UK, continuously enhance strategic communication and political mutual trust, and do not affect the long-term stable development of relations between the two countries due to ideological differences or differences over time. ——We must adhere to an open and inclusive attitude, view each other’s development as our own opportunities, continue to flexibly and pragmatically advance the cooperation between the two sides, accelerate the docking of their respective development strategies, deepen cooperation in various fields such as economic and trade, investment, finance, and infrastructure, strengthen cultural exchanges, and promote things Dialogue among civilizations to jointly maintain an open world economy and promote the diversification of world civilizations. ——We must adhere to the concept of win-win cooperation, promote the in-depth development of bilateral relations and all-round cooperation, and promote Sino-British cooperation and the “Belt and Road” ""Building together, and with the good momentum of Sino-British cooperation, help China-EU cooperation, promote the common development of Asia and Europe, promote global prosperity, and achieve the goal of win-win, multi-win, and win-win. -We must adhere to the pioneering and enterprising spirit, keep pace with the times in the cooperation between the two sides, constantly tap new potentials, inspire new vitality, increase new momentum, learn from each other’s governance experience, help each other’s reform process, and cooperate in international cooperation China dares to be the first to lead the trend of world development and reform. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""Survival or destruction is a problem."" Hamlet's words left a deep impression on me. I was less than 16 years old from Beijing to a farmer in a small village in northern Shaanxi, China, where I spent 7 years of my youth. At that time, I tried to find works by Shakespeare and read ""Midsummer Night's Dream"", ""Venetian Merchant"", ""Twelfth Night"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Hamlet"", ""Othello"", ""King Lear"" "", ""Macbeth"" and other scripts. Shakespeare's tumbling plots, lifelike characters, and weeping emotions all attracted me deeply. As a young man, in the barren yellow soil of northern Shaanxi, I kept thinking about the question of ""survival or destruction"". In the end, I set up my own faith for the motherland and the people. I believe that everyone who has read Shakespeare's works can not only feel his outstanding talents, but also get deep life inspiration. , China's Ming Dynasty dramatist Tang Xianzu was known as ""Shakespeare in the East"". His dramas such as ""Peony Pavilion"", ""Purple Hairpin"", ""Southern Keji"", ""Handanji"" and other dramas are world-renowned. Tang Xianzu and Shakespeare are of the same generation, both of them died in 1616Dramas such as ""The Story of Hairpin"", ""The Story of Nanke"" and ""The Handan"" are well-known in the world. Tang Xianzu and Shakespeare were of the same generation. Both of them died in 1616. Next year is the 400th anniversary of their death. China and Britain can jointly commemorate these two literary masters, so as to promote exchanges between the two peoples and deepen mutual understanding. , ""Fan Yi's way, go with the times."" Bacon said: ""The golden age is before us, not behind us."" In today's meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, we created a global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century."" ""Golden Age"" reached a consensus. Let us take action, seize the opportunities given by the times, jointly open the ""golden age"" of Sino-British relations, and strive to make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development! , Now, I propose:, to Mayor Ye Yalun and the City of London, toast! , (Xinhua News Agency, London, October 21st), ""People's Daily"" (October 23, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Promoting Openness and Tolerance and Promoting Peaceful Development,4769,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-10-23,"[, 尊敬的叶雅伦市长，, 尊敬的安德鲁王子殿下，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！很高兴在伦敦金融城同大家见面，相信我们会共同度过一个愉快的夜晚。, 这次我应伊丽莎白二世女王邀请对英国进行国事访问，旨在推动中英全面战略伙伴关系得到更大发展，更好造福两国人民。, 首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人名义，感谢英国王室、政府和人民对我们的热情接待，向在座各位，向友好的英国人民，向长期致力于中英合作和中英友好事业的各界人士，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 21年前，我曾经访问过英国，到了伦敦、牛津、格拉斯哥、爱丁堡等地，亲身感受了英国的悠久历史、独特传统、充沛活力。再次来到英国，看到耸立的大本钟，看到潋滟的泰晤士河，我有一种“不知何处是他乡”的感觉。此时此刻，有关英国的记忆不断在我脑海中闪现，我想到了英国资产阶级革命、工业革命、宪章运动、诺曼底登陆，想到了莎士比亚、拜伦、雪莱、萧伯纳，想到了培根、克伦威尔、丘吉尔，想到了托马斯·莫尔、约翰·洛克、亚当·斯密、达尔文、阿诺德·汤因比、李约瑟，想到了《双城记》、《雾都孤儿》、《简·爱》、《鲁滨逊漂流记》，想到了福尔摩斯，当然还有卡尔·马克思、弗里德里希·恩格斯……, 在漫长的历史进程中，中国人民和英国人民都创造了灿烂的文明，对人类文明进步产生了深远影响。中国是茶的故乡，英国则将下午茶文化发挥到极致。莎士比亚、华兹华斯、简·奥斯汀、狄更斯等人的作品让中国人感受到英国传统文学的魅力，《猫》、007系列电影、《哈利·波特》、《神探夏洛克》、《唐顿庄园》等当代英国文艺作品也受到中国观众喜爱。贝克汉姆等足球明星，曼联、阿森纳等俱乐部在中国拥有众多球迷。中国在英国的留学生超过15万；汉语热遍及英伦三岛，600多所中小学开设了中文课程。今年是历史上首个中英文化交流年，两国艺术家的交流精彩纷呈。这一切，印证了中英友好已深入人心，两国关系长远发展有着坚实的民意和社会基础。, 伦敦是世界历史文化名城，金融城则是伦敦的心脏，在这里可以感受到现代英国金融发展、经济跳动的强劲脉搏。在这一平方英里的土地上，管理着全球4万多亿美元的庞大资产，创造了英国3%的国内生产总值，中国五大银行均设立了分支，伦敦人民币离岸市场蓬勃发展，首支人民币货币市场交易所基金也在伦敦证券交易所挂牌。可以说，金融城既是中英深度合作的一个缩影，也是全球开放的一个生动诠释。, 当今世界，开放包容、多元互鉴是主基调。在21世纪人类文明的大家园中，各国虽然历史、文化、制度各异，但都应该彼此和谐相处、平等相待，都应该互尊互鉴、相互学习，摒弃一切傲慢和偏见。唯有如此，各国才能共同发展、共享繁荣。, 当今世界，相互联系、相互依存是大潮流。随着商品、资金、信息、人才的高度流动，无论近邻还是远交，无论大国还是小国，无论发达国家还是发展中国家，正日益形成利益交融、安危与共的利益共同体和命运共同体。冷战思维、阵营对抗已不符合时代要求。, 当今世界，和平、发展、合作、共赢是主旋律。世界经济复苏进程曲折，国际和地区热点此起彼伏，恐怖主义、网络安全、气候变化、重大传染性疾病等全球性挑战仍很严峻。面对前所未有的挑战，没有任何一个国家可以独善其身。世界各国需要以负责任的精神同舟共济、协调行动。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 在当今世界复杂多变的形势中，中国发展日益受到各方关注。一段时间以来，国际上对中国的各种看法和评价众说纷纭，其中有“唱多”，也有“唱空”，还有“唱衰”，有赞许、理解、信心，也有困惑、疑虑、误解。, 当然，了解和理解一个有着5000多年文明、56个民族、13亿多人口的大国，确实不是一件容易的事情，但最好的判断就是以事实为依据，不要雾里看花、水中观月。这里，我愿就大家最感兴趣的几个问题谈谈看法。, 第一，中国人民走的是历史选择的道路。道路决定命运。一个国家，一个民族，只有找到适合自己条件的道路，才能实现自己的发展目标。改革开放37年来，中国经济年均增速近10%，成为全球第二大经济体，6亿多人口摆脱贫困，人均国内生产总值超过7000美元。中国用几十年时间走完了发达国家几百年走过的发展历程。这充分说明，中国人民正走在正确的道路上。, 历史是现实的源头。近代以后，中国饱受战乱动荡，历经长达一个多世纪的磨难。100多年前，中国人民开始“睁眼看世界”，努力探寻救国救民的道路。中国民主革命的先行者孙中山先生曾经到英国求学。在经历君主立宪制、议会制、总统制等的失败尝试后，中国最终选择了社会主义道路。这是历史的选择、人民的选择。诚如英国哲学家罗素所说：“只有中国人最了解自己”，“只有他们自己慢慢摸索出的解决办法才是长久之计。”, 中华民族历来注重变革创新。中国社会主义不是教科书里的教条，不是刻板僵化的戒律，而是在实践中不断发展变化的生命体。我们在实践中不断完善，在发展中不断变革，形成和发展了中国特色社会主义。中国特色社会主义就是要建设社会主义市场经济、民主政治、先进文化、和谐社会、生态文明，促进人的全面发展，促进社会公平正义，逐步实现全体人民共同富裕。, “履不必同，期于适足；治不必同，期于利民。”世界上没有放之四海而皆准的发展道路。只有能够持续造福人民的发展道路，才是最有生命力的。, 第二，中国人民要的是更加美好的生活。当前，全中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。我们确立了“两个一百年”奋斗目标，即到2020年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。我们深知，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家。按照中国的标准，中国还有7000万人没有脱贫。按照联合国标准，中国还有2亿左右人口生活在贫困线以下。要让生活更加美好，中国人民还需要进行长期努力。, 中国梦是中国人民追求幸福的梦，也同各国人民的美好梦想息息相通。中国发展必将寓于世界发展潮流之中，也将为世界各国共同发展注入更多活力、带来更多机遇。中国是一个负责任大国，在国际金融危机期间我们同国际社会风雨与共，为世界经济复苏发挥了“稳定器”和“发动机”的作用。当前，中国经济增长对全球经济增长的贡献率仍接近30%。我们正在加快推进新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化，发展资本市场，提高开放型经济水平，中国的进口和出口、引进外资和对外投资将更加均衡。中国正在大力推进创新驱动发展战略，李约瑟在其巨著《中国科技史》中深入总结了中国古代科技发展的成就，中国要紧跟新的科技革命潮流，努力创造一流的科技成果。预计未来5年中国将进口超过10万亿美元的商品，对外投资规模将超过5000亿美元，还将有超过5亿人次出境参观访问、旅游购物。这对世界经济发展无疑是重大利好。中国愿同包括英国在内的国际社会一道，以实实在在的行动释放出更多潜力，实现更好发展。, 第三，中国人民想的是和平与发展的世界。和为贵、和而不同、协和万邦等理念在中国代代相传，和平的基因深植于中华民族的血脉之中。近代以后，中国人民历经苦难，所以更珍视和平；中国致力于发展，所以更需要和平；中国期待美好未来，所以更爱护和平。中国坚持走和平发展道路，不接受“国强必霸”的逻辑。任何人、任何事、任何理由都不能动摇中国走和平发展道路的决心和意志。, 中国倡导国际社会共同构建人类命运共同体，建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，坚持国际关系民主化，坚持正确义利观，坚持通过对话协商以和平方式解决国家间的分歧和争端。我们将同世界各国一道，维护世界和平，捍卫公平正义，推进共同繁荣。, 中国的发展得益于国际社会，也必将回馈国际大家庭。中国一直是国际合作的倡导者和国际多边主义的积极参与者，将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略。随着中国实力上升，我们将逐步承担更多力所能及的责任，努力为促进世界经济增长和完善全球治理贡献中国智慧、中国力量。中国的发展不会牺牲别国利益，只会增进共同利益。中国将同各国一道，逢山开路、遇河架桥。世界上的路，只有走的人多了，才会越来越宽广。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中英相隔万里，但虽远犹近。中国视英国为重要伙伴和真诚朋友。第二次世界大战结束以来，中英关系总体走在中国同西方关系前列。近年来，两国关系和合作得到长足发展，正在稳定健康的快车道上加速行进。英国已经成为中国在欧盟内第二大贸易伙伴和投资目的地国，也是除香港外最大人民币境外交易中心。中国是英国在欧盟外第二大贸易伙伴和在亚洲首要投资目的地。从衣食住行到能源、基建、金融、科研，中英全方位务实合作成果早已“飞入寻常百姓家”，不断惠及两国民众。, 30多年前，中国领导人邓小平和英国首相撒切尔夫人以超凡的战略眼光，促成两国创造性解决了香港问题，树立了以和平方式解决历史遗留问题的典范。30多年后的今天，英国在西方大国中率先申请加入亚洲基础设施投资银行。我期待英方继续在对华各领域合作中做引领潮流、开放包容的典范，成为西方同中国合作的领跑者，以实际行动践行“中国在西方世界的最强支持者”。, ——我们要坚持长远和战略眼光，牢牢把握两国关系的大局和大势，持续充实中英全面战略伙伴关系内涵，不断增进战略沟通和政治互信，不因意识形态差异或一时一事上的分歧影响两国关系长期稳定发展。, ——我们要坚持开放包容的心态，视彼此发展为自身机遇，继续灵活务实推进双方合作，加快各自发展战略对接，深化经贸、投资、金融、基建等各领域合作，加强人文交流，共促东西方文明对话，共同维护开放型世界经济和促进世界文明多样化。, ——我们要坚持合作共赢的理念，推动两国关系和全方位合作不断深入发展，把中英合作和“一带一路”建设结合起来，并以中英合作良好势头助力中欧合作，助推亚欧共同发展，促进全球繁荣，实现双赢、多赢、共赢的目标。, ——我们要坚持开拓进取的精神，在双方合作中做到与时俱进，不断挖掘新潜力、激发新活力、增加新动力，相互借鉴治国理政经验，助力彼此改革进程，在国际合作中敢为人先，引领世界发展和改革潮流。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “生存还是毁灭，这是一个问题。”哈姆雷特的这句话，给我留下了极为深刻的印象。我不到16岁就从北京来到了中国陕北的一个小村子当农民，在那里度过了7年青春时光。那个年代，我想方设法寻找莎士比亚的作品，读了《仲夏夜之梦》、《威尼斯商人》、《第十二夜》、《罗密欧与朱丽叶》、《哈姆雷特》、《奥赛罗》、《李尔王》、《麦克白》等剧本。莎士比亚笔下跌宕起伏的情节、栩栩如生的人物、如泣如诉的情感，都深深吸引着我。年轻的我，在当年陕北贫瘠的黄土地上，不断思考着“生存还是毁灭”的问题，最后我立下为祖国、为人民奉献自己的信念。我相信，每个读过莎士比亚作品的人，不仅能够感受到他卓越的才华，而且能够得到深刻的人生启迪。, 中国明代剧作家汤显祖被称为“东方的莎士比亚”，他创作的《牡丹亭》、《紫钗记》、《南柯记》、《邯郸记》等戏剧享誉世界。汤显祖与莎士比亚是同时代的人，他们两人都是1616年逝世的。明年是他们逝世400周年。中英两国可以共同纪念这两位文学巨匠，以此推动两国人民交流、加深相互理解。, “凡益之道，与时偕行。”培根说：“黄金时代在我们面前，而不是身后。”在今天同卡梅伦首相的会晤中，我们就开创面向21世纪全球全面战略伙伴关系“黄金时代”达成共识。让我们行动起来，抓住时代赋予的机遇，共同开启中英关系的“黄金时代”，努力为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 现在，我提议：, 为叶雅伦市长和伦敦金融城，干杯！, （新华社伦敦10月21日电） , 《 人民日报 》（

30,144,"[, Dear Prime Minister Sharif, Dear Chairman of the Senate Rabbani, Dear Speaker of the Sadiq National Assembly, Ministers, Friends of Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Today, there is a chance to come The Pakistani parliament has face-to-face exchanges with friends and colleagues, and I am very happy. The Pakistani Parliament has invited me to give a speech, which fully shows your deep friendship for the Chinese people, and I sincerely thank you! , First of all, on behalf of more than 1.3 billion Chinese people, I extend my sincerest regards and best wishes to the brotherly Pakistani people! Taking this opportunity, I would like to pay high tribute to friends from all walks of life who have contributed to the friendship and cooperation between China and Pakistan for a long time! , Pakistan is the first stop of my visit this year. Although this is my first time in Pakistan, I am no stranger to Pakistan. There is an old saying in China: ""Meeting Junjun is like returning to an old man."" This is how I really visited Pakistan. When I was young, I often heard the older generations tell Pakistan’s customs and touching stories of China-Pakistan friendship. I have long been fascinated by Pakistan. As soon as I set foot on this beautiful land, my colleagues and I were immersed in the warm and friendly ocean, as if returning to our brother-in-law's home. , The friendship between China and Pakistan is a faithful and faithful exchange of friendship, and a friendship of mutual suffering. It is a model of friendship between countries. The Pakistani people liken the Sino-Pakistani friendship to ""higher than mountains, deeper than the sea, and sweeter than honey."" The Chinese people affectionately call the Pakistani people ""good friends, good neighbors, good partners, good brothers."" During this visit, I agreed with President Hussein and Prime Minister Sharif to promote China-Pakistan relations to an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership. All-weather is the meaning of wind and rain, always walking together. This positioning is a vivid portrayal of China-Pakistan all-weather friendship and all-round cooperation, and it deserves its name. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Pakistan is a young and ancient great country. This hot land gave birth to splendid ancient civilizations and wrote magnificent poems in modern history for national independence and national self-improvement. The Pakistani people are kind and courageous, self-esteem and self-confident, and have a persevering and tenacious national temperament. Over the past 60 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Pakistani government and people have faced complicated domestic and foreign situations, calmly responded to various severe challenges, and made remarkable achievements on the road to defend the country's sovereign independence and territorial integrity, build the country, and develop the economy. Since entering the new century, Pakistan has been at the forefront of international counter-terrorism, has made tremendous efforts, endured tremendous sacrifices, and made outstanding contributions to regional and even world peace and stability. The Chinese people have deep respect for the Pakistani people. , Pakistan's founding father Jinnah said: ""We are going to go all out, because we believe in the future of the sun."" The future can be expected and can be created in the future. At present, Pakistan is facing historic development opportunities. Prime Minister Sharif proposed the dream of ""Asian Tiger"" and outlined a grand blueprint for Pakistan. The Chinese people believe that the united and unremitting efforts of the Pakistani people will surely create new miracles and create new glories in the journey of national construction. The Chinese people will always stand with the Pakistani people! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! As early as 2000 years ago, the Silk Road built a bridge of friendship between our two ancient civilizations. The footprints of the Chinese emperor Zhang Qian, the Eastern Jin monk Fa Xian, and the Tang monk Xuan Zang have all been here. Pakistan believes that ""integrity is more useful than wealth"", and China believes that ""people are untrustworthy, and they don't know what they can do."" The traditional cultural concepts of the two countries are consistent. In modern times, China and Pakistan have suffered aggression and oppression by imperialism and colonialism, sympathizing with and supporting each other. As early as the 1930s, Pakistan’s great poet Iqbal wrote the verse “The sleeping Chinese people are awakening, and the springs in the Himalayas are boiling”, praising and supporting the Chinese people in their struggle for national independence and resistance to foreign aggression . Similar historical encounters and a common course of struggle have made the people of China and Pakistan connected. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Pakistan have established all-weather friendship and carried out all-round cooperation with the care and nurturing of the leaders of the two countries. No matter how the international situation and the domestic situation of the two countries change, the two countries have always understood and supported each other on issues involving each other's core interests. This friendship is unique. , ""The winds know the grass and the fire sees the real gold."" We will not forget that Pakistan is one of the first countries to recognize New China and the first Islamic country to establish diplomatic relations with New China. Break the external blockade and recovery in New ChinaStan was one of the first countries to recognize New China and the first Islamic country to establish diplomatic relations with New China. At the critical moment when New China breaks the external blockade, resumes its legal seat in the United Nations, and explores reform and opening up, Pakistan always stands up and gives us selfless and precious help. When China encounters natural disasters and difficult challenges, Pakistan always reaches out in time. In 2008, a huge earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China. Pakistan assisted, dispatched all strategic transport aircraft, and transported all the strategic reserve tents to the disaster area as soon as possible. To save space on the plane, the accompanying medical team removed the seats on the plane and sat on the floor along the way. Today, thousands of Pakistani staff work with Chinese employees around the world to build projects undertaken by China, and many moving stories emerge. Similarly, when Pakistan needs it, China has always been a strong backing for Pakistan. China firmly supports Pakistan’s efforts to safeguard sovereign independence and territorial integrity. In 2010, Pakistan suffered a severe flood. China reached out for the first time, land and air all-round assistance, dispatched the largest medical rescue team in history, and dispatched large-scale convoys and helicopters for rescue missions for the first time, setting a precedent in the history of China's foreign aid. At the end of 2014, after the Peshawar terrorist attack, China specially invited the injured Pakistani students and their families to go to China to recuperate, so that the young children’s heart was inspired by the sincere friendship of the Chinese people. In the recent evacuation of overseas Chinese in Yemen, Chinese warships carried 176 Pakistani citizens from the port of Aden, and Pakistani warships assisted the evacuation of 8 Chinese students from Mukalla port. The commander of the Pakistani warship issued an order: ""As long as Chinese students are not available, our warship will not leave Hong Kong."" This loud and loud remark once again proves that the friendship between China and Pakistan is deeper than the sea. Mr. Geng Biao, a former Chinese ambassador to Pakistan and my old leader, once said: ""The traditional friendship between China and Pakistan will inevitably go wider and wider like the Karakorum Highway."" Today, the development of China-Pakistan relations confirms his prediction. In the face of adversity, both China and Pakistan feel the preciousness of good neighbors and the warmth of friends more and more deeply. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Today, both China and Pakistan shoulder the historic task of national rejuvenation and are committed to the great dream of strengthening the country and enriching the people. More than ever, we need to work closely together to take advantage of the traditional friendly advantages of the two countries, geographical proximity, and complementary economic advantages, share opportunities, meet challenges, seek common development, and constantly enrich the connotation of the community of shared destiny between China and Pakistan for better benefit. The peoples of the two countries promote regional stability and prosperity and play an exemplary role in building a community with a shared future for Asia. , First, China and Pakistan must help each other and deepen strategic cooperation. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries, take the path of independence and self-reliance at home, and adhere to a peaceful foreign policy abroad. The most important feature of China-Pakistan relations is a high degree of political mutual trust. Everything is for the other party and always thinks from the perspective of the other party. We want to maintain the tradition of frequent mutual visits and meetings between high-level officials of the two countries. Leaders of the two countries should come and go as often as relatives, strengthen cooperation on major strategic issues, and lead the continuous development of China-Pakistan relations. We must support each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national dignity, and be the most reliable partner. Secondly, China and Pakistan must promote justice and benefit and achieve common development. Chinese culture advocates ""to stand for oneself if one wants to stand, and to reach oneself if one wants to reach oneself"". China adheres to the correct view of righteousness and benefit, and helping Pakistan means helping ourselves. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is an important starting point for China and Pakistan to achieve common development. We must give play to the leading role of the corridor construction in pragmatic cooperation between the two countries, with the corridor construction as the center, focusing on Gwadar Port, energy, infrastructure construction, and industrial cooperation to form a ""1+4"" cooperation layout. The planning and layout of the corridor should take into account all areas of Pakistan, so that the development results can benefit all the people of Pakistan and the people of all countries in the region. , Yesterday, our two sides signed dozens of cooperation agreements. I believe these agreements will effectively promote the pragmatic cooperation between China and Pakistan, especially the substantive progress in the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. To support Pakistan's economic development and improve people's livelihood, China has decided to provide Pakistan with free assistance for the reconstruction of federally-administered tribal areas and Pakistan's livelihood projects of concern. Thirdly, China and Pakistan should be close to each other and adhere to friendship from generation to generation. The people are the decisive force for national progress and historical development. The support of the two peoples is an inexhaustible driving force for China-Pakistan all-weather friendship and all-round cooperation. 2015 is the year of China-Pakistan friendly exchanges. We will use the friendship city exchange, cultural center, and news media as platforms to carry out diverse and rich celebrations. We should continue the tradition of sending 100-member youth groups to each other and encourage the young generations of the two countries to have more exchanges and exchanges. China will provide 2,000 trainings to Pakistan in the next 5 yearsIt is necessary to continue the tradition of sending 100-member youth groups to each other and encourage the young generations of the two countries to have more contacts and exchanges. China will provide Pakistan with 2,000 training places in the next five years and help Pakistan to train 1,000 Chinese teachers. We welcome Pakistan’s active participation in the China-South Asia Humanities Exchange Program, so that the friendship between China and Pakistan will become more popular. Fourthly, China and Pakistan want to be in the same boat and challenge security together. The security interests of China and Pakistan are closely related. For a long time, Pakistan has overcome all kinds of difficulties and made important contributions to the security and stability of the western borders of China. We bear this in mind. China will help Pakistan strengthen its anti-terrorism and security capacity building, strengthen cooperation with Pakistan, jointly deal with the increasing number of non-traditional security threats, and provide reliable security for economic cooperation and common development of the two countries. . Fifth, China and Pakistan must bravely shoulder their responsibilities and strengthen international cooperation. China-Pakistan relations go far beyond the bilateral scope. Both sides should maintain strategic communication on the international and regional situation and strengthen coordination and cooperation on major global and regional issues. China supports Pakistan in playing a constructive role on the Afghanistan issue, and is willing to work with Pakistan to promote the process of reconciliation in Afghanistan and support the smooth transition of Afghanistan. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations and the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. We must reaffirm our firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and jointly promote the establishment of a new type of international relations centered on win-win cooperation. No matter how the international situation changes, China will always view China-Pakistan relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, and place Pakistan on the top of China's diplomacy. Pakistan has a proverb: ""The wind is not always blowing in the direction of the seafarers' hopes."" I want to say that as long as our hearts are always thinking in the direction of the hopes of the two peoples, Jin is always in the direction of the hopes of the two peoples. Therefore, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles along the way. The China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership will have wider fields, richer levels, and more connotations. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, China is in a decisive stage of fully building a well-off society. China's interaction with the world and the integration of interests are closer. China will strengthen cooperation with development partners including Pakistan and make new and greater contributions to regional and global economic growth. The Chinese nation has always loved peace. The Chinese people realized the truth of ""the country is big, but belligerence will die"" more than 2,000 years ago. The Chinese people advocate ""do not do what you don't want, do not impose on others"", and China does not agree with ""the theory that the country must be hegemonic"". Taking the path of peaceful development is good for China, good for Asia, and good for the world. No force can shake China’s belief in peaceful development. China adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and will not impose its will on others. Even if it is strong, it will never seek hegemony. , China will adhere to the concept of win-win cooperation, unswervingly develop friendly cooperation with all countries in the world, adhere to the concept of sincerity and benefit, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries, and strive to better its own development to benefit neighboring countries and always do Reliable friends and sincere partners of developing countries. China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, comprehensively promote opening to the outside world, develop an open economic system, and strive to bring new opportunities and space to the development of Asia and the world. China's proposal to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is an important measure to expand all-round opening-up under the new situation, and it is also committed to enabling more countries to share development opportunities and achievements. We hope to strengthen cooperation with countries along the “Belt and Road”, achieve road connectivity, smooth trade, financial and financial communication, policy communication, and people's hearts, and jointly create an open cooperation platform to provide new impetus for regional sustainable development. South Asia is located at the intersection of the “Belt and Road” and the land, and is an important direction and cooperative partner to promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor are closely related to the ""Belt and Road"" and are progressing smoothly. The construction of the two major corridors will effectively promote the economic growth of the countries concerned and provide new and powerful impetus for deepening regional cooperation in South Asia. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Peace, development and cooperation are the themes of our great era. The vast and rich South Asian region contains unlimited vitality for development, and the industrious and wise people of South Asia are striving to open up new prospects for regional development and create a new growth pole for the world economy. , China is the largest neighboring country in South Asia. A peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia is in China’s interest. China is willing to effectively connect with the development strategies of South Asian countries to achieve mutually beneficial development and common prosperity. During my visit to the three countries in South Asia last year, I put forward a series of initiatives to strengthen cooperation between China and South Asia, which is currently being implemented steadily. China respects the unique culture and historical traditions of South Asia, and is willing to be a sincere partner of South Asian countries, treat each other with respect and equality, take care of each other's comfort, and ensure the long-term and healthy development of bilateral relations. , Only mutual cooperation, mutual benefit and win-win, can make the common interest cake,Wait for each other to take care of each other's comfort and ensure the long-term healthy development of the relationship between the two parties. Only by mutual cooperation, mutual benefit and win-win can we make the common interest cake bigger and move towards common prosperity. We are willing to take South Asia as a key region open to the west, strengthen mutual development experience with South Asian countries, and promote complementary development advantages. China is willing to provide assistance and support within its capacity to South Asian countries within the framework of South-South cooperation. Both China and South Asian countries have a long history, and both advocate goodness and friendship, tolerance and mutual learning, and harmonious coexistence. As an important part of the Asian Civilization Dialogue, China is willing to strengthen the civilization dialogue with South Asian countries to jointly spread Oriental wisdom and promote Asian values. Openness, inclusiveness, and self-reliance are the successful experiences of Asian countries in achieving development and prosperity and national revitalization, and the only way to achieve greater development in the future. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with South Asian countries and advance the process of regional cooperation in South Asia and Asia. China is willing to enhance the level of cooperation with SAARC, strengthen international cooperation with South Asian countries within a multilateral framework, and jointly safeguard the interests of developing countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The construction of a community of shared destiny between China and Pakistan is a strategic choice made by the governments and peoples of China and Pakistan in the light of the fundamental interests of the two countries. Pakistan’s founder Jinnah said: “Only through united efforts can our ideals be turned into reality.” Let us join hands and work together to create a better future for both countries! , thank you all!

尊敬的谢里夫总理，, 尊敬的拉巴尼参议院主席，, 尊敬的萨迪克国民议会议长，, 各位部长，, 各位议员朋友，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天，有机会来到巴基斯坦议会同各位议员朋友面对面交流，我感到非常高兴。巴基斯坦议会邀请我发表演讲，充分表明了你们对中国人民的深情厚谊，我对此表示衷心的感谢！, 首先，我代表13亿多中国人民，向兄弟的巴基斯坦人民，致以最诚挚的问候和最美好的祝愿！借此机会，我要向长期以来为中巴两国友谊和合作作出贡献的各界朋友，致以崇高的敬意！, 巴基斯坦是我今年出访的第一站。这虽然是我第一次来到巴基斯坦，但我对巴基斯坦一点也不陌生。中国有句古话：“与君初相识，犹如故人归。”这就是我访问巴基斯坦的真实感受。我年轻时经常听到老一辈人讲述巴基斯坦的风土人情和中巴友谊的感人故事，早就对巴基斯坦心驰神往。一踏上这片美丽的土地，我和我的同事们就沉浸在热情友好的海洋之中，仿佛回到亲如手足的兄弟家中。, 中国和巴基斯坦的友谊是肝胆相照的信义之交，休戚与共的患难之交，堪称国与国友好相处的典范。巴基斯坦人民将中巴友谊比喻为“比山高，比海深，比蜜甜”。中国人民则亲切地称巴基斯坦人民为“好朋友、好邻居、好伙伴、好兄弟”。, 这次访问期间，我同侯赛因总统、谢里夫总理一致同意将中巴关系提升为全天候战略合作伙伴关系。全天候就是风雨无阻、永远同行的意思。这一定位是中巴全天候友谊和全方位合作的鲜明写照，可谓实至名归。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 巴基斯坦是一个年轻而又古老的伟大国家。这片热土孕育了辉煌灿烂的古代文明，在近代史上书写了争取民族独立、国家自强的壮丽诗篇。巴基斯坦人民善良勇敢、自尊自信，有着百折不挠、坚韧不拔的民族气质。建国60多年来，巴基斯坦政府和人民面对复杂的国内外形势，沉着应对各种严峻挑战，在捍卫国家主权独立和领土完整、建设国家和发展经济的道路上取得了显著成就。进入新世纪以来，巴基斯坦身处国际反恐前沿，付出了巨大努力，承受了巨大牺牲，为地区乃至世界和平稳定作出了突出贡献。中国人民对巴基斯坦人民充满深深的敬意。, 巴基斯坦国父真纳说过：“我们不辞赴汤蹈火，因为相信阳光未来。”未来可以期待，未来也可以创造。当前，巴基斯坦面临着历史性发展机遇。谢里夫总理提出了“亚洲之虎”的梦想，为巴基斯坦勾画出宏伟蓝图。中国人民相信，巴基斯坦人民团结一心、不懈努力，一定能够在国家建设征程中创造新的奇迹、铸就新的辉煌。中国人民将始终同巴基斯坦人民站在一起！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 早在2000多年前，丝绸之路就在我们两个古老文明之间架起了友谊的桥梁。中国汉代使节张骞、东晋高僧法显、唐代高僧玄奘的足迹都曾经到过这里。巴基斯坦认为“诚信比财富更有用”，中国认为“人而无信，不知其可也”，两国传统文化理念契合相通。在近代，中巴曾经遭受帝国主义、殖民主义的侵略和压迫，彼此同情，相互支持。早在上世纪30年代，巴基斯坦伟大诗人伊克巴尔就写下了“沉睡的中国人民正在觉醒，喜马拉雅山的山泉已经开始沸腾”的诗句，赞扬和声援中国人民争取民族独立、反抗外来侵略的斗争。相似的历史遭遇，共同的斗争历程，使中巴人民心灵相通。, 建交以来，在两国历代领导人关心和培育下，在两国各界人士共同努力下，中巴建立了全天候友谊，开展了全方位合作。无论国际风云和两国国内局势如何变化，两国在涉及彼此核心利益问题上一贯相互理解、相互支持。这份情谊堪称独一无二。, “疾风知劲草，烈火见真金。”我们不会忘记，巴基斯坦是最早承认新中国的国家之一，也是首个同新中国建立外交关系的伊斯兰国家。在新中国打破外部封锁、恢复在联合国合法席位、探索改革开放等关键时刻，巴基斯坦总是挺身而出，给予我们无私而宝贵的帮助。在中国遇到自然灾害和困难挑战的时候，巴基斯坦总是及时伸出援手。2008年中国汶川发生特大地震，巴基斯坦倾囊相助，出动所有的战略运输机，将全部战略储备帐篷第一时间运到了灾区。随行医疗队为节省飞机空间，拆掉了飞机上的座椅，一路上席地而坐。今天，数以千计的巴基斯坦工作人员在各地同中国职工一起夜以继日建设中国承担的项目，涌现出许多感人肺腑的故事。, 同样，在巴基斯坦需要的时候，中国始终是巴方的坚强后盾。中国坚定支持巴基斯坦维护主权独立和领土完整的努力。2010年巴基斯坦遭受特大洪灾，中国第一时间伸出援手，陆空全方位施援，派出历史上最大规模的医疗救援队，首次派遣大规模车队和直升机执行救援任务，开创了中国对外援助史上的先河。2014年底，白沙瓦恐怖袭击事件发生后，中方专门邀请巴方受伤学生和家人赴华疗养，让孩子们幼小的心灵感受到中国人民真挚的情谊。, 在不久前的也门撤侨行动中，中国军舰搭载176名巴基斯坦公民从亚丁港撤离，巴基斯坦军舰协助从穆卡拉港撤离8名中国留学生。巴方军舰指挥官下达命令：“只要中国留学生不到，我们的军舰就不离港。”这掷地有声的话语再次证明中巴友谊情比海深。, 中国前驻巴基斯坦大使、也是我的老领导耿飚先生曾经说过：“中巴传统友谊必然像喀喇昆仑公路一样越走越宽广。”今天，中巴关系发展印证了他的预言。患难见真情，中国和巴基斯坦都越来越深切地感受到善邻的珍贵、朋友的温暖。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 今天，中巴两国都肩负着民族振兴的历史重任，致力于强国富民的伟大梦想。我们比以往任何时候都更需要紧密携手合作，发挥两国传统友好优势、地缘毗邻优势、经济互补优势，共享机遇，共迎挑战，共谋发展，不断充实中巴命运共同体的内涵，更好造福两国人民，促进地区稳定和繁荣、为打造亚洲命运共同体发挥示范作用。, 第一，中巴要守望相助，深化战略合作。中国和巴基斯坦同为发展中国家，对内走独立自主、自力更生的道路，对外坚持和平外交政策。中巴关系的最大特点是高度政治互信，凡事为对方着想，始终站在对方的角度思考问题。我们要保持两国高层经常互访和会晤的传统。两国领导人要像走亲戚一样常来常往，就重大战略性问题加强合作，引领中巴关系不断向前发展。我们要在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互支持，坚定维护国家主权、领土完整、民族尊严，做最可靠的伙伴。, 第二，中巴要弘义融利，实现共同发展。中华文化倡导“己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人”。中国坚持正确义利观，帮助巴基斯坦就是帮助我们自己。中巴经济走廊是中巴实现共同发展的重要抓手。我们要发挥走廊建设对两国务实合作的引领作用，以走廊建设为中心，以瓜达尔港、能源、基础设施建设、产业合作为重点，形成“1+4”合作布局。走廊规划和布局要兼顾巴基斯坦各地区，让发展成果惠及巴基斯坦全体人民，进而惠及本地区各国人民。, 昨天，我们双方签署了数十项合作协议，相信这些协议将有力推动中巴务实合作，特别是推动中巴经济走廊建设取得实质性进展。为支持巴基斯坦发展经济、改善民生，中方决定向巴方提供无偿援助，用于联邦直辖部落区重建和巴方关切的民生项目。, 第三，中巴要心心相印，坚持世代友好。人民是推动国家进步和历史发展的决定力量，两国人民支持是中巴全天候友谊和全方位合作的不竭动力。2015年是中巴友好交流年，我们要以友城交流、文化中心、新闻媒体为平台，开展形式多样、内容丰富的庆祝活动。我们要延续互派百人青年团的传统，鼓励两国青年一代多来往、多交流。中国将在未来5年内为巴方提供2000个培训名额，并帮助巴方培训1000名汉语教师。我们欢迎巴方积极参与中国—南亚人文交流计划，让中巴友好更加深入人心。, 第四，中巴要风雨同舟，共对安全挑战。中巴两国安全利益休戚相关。长期以来，巴方克服种种困难，为中国西部边陲安全稳定作出了重要贡献，我们对此铭记于心。中方将帮助巴方加强反恐和安全能力建设，同巴方加强配合，共同应对日益增多的非传统安全威胁，为两国经济合作和共同发展提供可靠的安全保障。, 第五，中巴要勇担责任，加强国际协作。中巴关系远远超出了双边范畴。双方要就国际和地区形势保持战略沟通，在重大全球和地区问题上加强协调和配合。中方支持巴方在阿富汗问题上发挥建设性作用，愿同巴方一道推动阿富汗和解进程，支持阿富汗平稳过渡。今年是联合国成立和世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年，我们要重申对联合国宪章宗旨和原则的坚定承诺，共同推动构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系。, 不论国际风云如何变幻，中国将始终从战略高度和长远角度看待中巴关系，将巴基斯坦置于中国外交优先位置。巴基斯坦有一句谚语：“风，不是总朝着海员希望的方向吹。”我要说，只要我们的心总是朝着两国人民希望的方向想，劲总是朝着两国人民希望的方向使，就一定能够战胜前进道路上的一切艰难险阻，中巴全天候战略合作伙伴关系将会领域更宽广、层次更丰富、内涵更充实。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，中国正处在全面建成小康社会决定性阶段。中国与世界的互动和利益融合更加紧密，中国将同包括巴基斯坦在内的发展伙伴加强合作，为地区和全球经济增长作出新的更大贡献。, 中华民族历来爱好和平。中国人在两千多年前就认识到“国虽大，好战必亡”的道理。中国人民崇尚“己所不欲，勿施于人”，中国不认同“国强必霸论”。走和平发展道路，对中国有利，对亚洲有利，对世界也有利，任何力量都不能动摇中国和平发展的信念。中国坚持不干涉别国内政原则，不会把自己的意志强加于人，即使再强大也永远不称霸。, 中国将坚持合作共赢的理念，坚定不移发展同世界各国的友好合作，坚持按照亲诚惠容的理念，深化同周边国家的互利合作，努力使自身发展更好惠及周边国家，永远做发展中国家的可靠朋友和真诚伙伴。中国将坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略，全面推进对外开放，发展开放型经济体系，努力为亚洲和世界发展带来新的机遇和空间。, 中国提出建设丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路倡议，是在新形势下扩大全方位开放的重要举措，也是要致力于使更多国家共享发展机遇和成果。我们希望同“一带一路”沿线国家加强合作，实现道路联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、政策沟通、民心相通，共同打造开放合作平台，为地区可持续发展提供新动力。, 南亚地处“一带一路”海陆交汇之处，是推进“一带一路”建设的重要方向和合作伙伴。中巴经济走廊和孟中印缅经济走廊与“一带一路”关联紧密，进展顺利。两大走廊建设将有力促进有关国家经济增长，并为深化南亚区域合作提供新的强大动力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 和平、发展、合作是我们这个伟大时代的主题。广阔富饶的南亚地区蕴含着无限发展生机，勤劳智慧的南亚人民正在奋力开拓地区发展新局面，打造世界经济新的增长极。, 中国是南亚最大的邻国。一个和平稳定、发展繁荣的南亚符合中国利益。中国愿同南亚国家的发展战略有效对接，实现互利发展，共同繁荣。我去年访问南亚三国期间，提出了加强中国同南亚合作的一系列倡议，目前正在稳步落实之中。中方尊重南亚地区的独特文化和历史传统，愿做南亚国家的真诚伙伴，同地区国家相互尊重、平等相待，照顾彼此舒适度，确保双方关系长期健康发展。, 只有相互合作、互利共赢，才能做大共同利益蛋糕，走向共同繁荣。我们愿将南亚作为向西开放的重点地区，同南亚各国加强发展经验互鉴，推动发展优势互补。中方愿在南南合作框架内，对南亚国家提供力所能及的帮助和支持。, 中国和南亚国家都拥有悠久历史，都崇尚向善友爱、包容互鉴、和谐共生。作为亚洲文明对话的重要组成部分，中国愿同南亚国家加强文明对话，共同传播东方智慧，弘扬亚洲价值。, 开放包容、联合自强，是亚洲国家实现发展繁荣和民族振兴的成功经验，也是今后实现更大发展的必由之路。中国愿同南亚国家加强合作，一道推进南亚和亚洲区域合作进程。中国愿提升同南盟合作水平，同南亚国家在多边框架内加强国际协作，共同维护广大发展中国家利益。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 构建中巴命运共同体，是中巴两国政府和人民从两国根本利益出发作出的战略抉择。巴基斯坦国父真纳说：“只有通过团结一致的努力，才能把我们的理想变成现实。”让我们携起手来，共同开创两国更加美好的未来！, 谢谢大家！, （新华社伊斯兰堡4月21日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年04月22日 02 版）,

31,145,"[, Dear Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers, Heads of International and Regional Organizations, Dear Members of the Boao Forum for Asia Council, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Today’s Boao, Hai Wide sail dancing, the sky is warm and windy. In this beautiful season, guests from all sides gathered together to discuss the development plans of Asia and Asia and other regions of the world, which is of great significance. , First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I sincerely welcome all guests to the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2015! Congratulations on the annual meeting! The theme of this year's Boao Forum for Asia is ""Asia's New Future: Towards a Community of Destiny."" The theme is just in time. It has both important practical significance and long-term historical significance. I hope that everyone will speak freely and contribute their insights to the peace and development of Asia and the world. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! History is always able to evoke people's memories and reflections at some important time points. This year is the 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the Chinese People’s Anti-Japanese War, the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference, and the year of the establishment of the ASEAN Community. This is an important year worthy of commemoration and an important moment to inspire people to remember history and learn from each other. In the past 70 years, the world has undergone unprecedented and profound changes, which have historically changed the destiny of mankind. The global colonial system collapsed, the Cold War confrontation ceased to exist, the interconnectedness and interdependence of all countries deepened, the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation rolled forward, and the international power balance developed in a direction conducive to maintaining world peace. The overall international situation is stable and there are more favorable conditions for promoting the common development of all countries. In the past 70 years, the Asian situation has also undergone unprecedented changes. The countries of the region have achieved national independence, mastered their own destiny, and strengthened the power to maintain regional and world peace. Asian countries took the lead in advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and together with African countries, put forward the Ten Principles for Handling Inter-State Relations at the Bandung Conference. After the end of the Cold War, Asian countries have gradually formed an Asian approach of mutual respect, consensus, and care for the comfort of all parties in promoting regional cooperation. All of these have made historic contributions to correctly handling national relations and promoting the establishment of new types of international relations. Over the past 70 years, more and more Asian countries have found a development path that suits their national conditions, from poverty and backwardness to development and revitalization, and entering the fast track of economic development. Regional and cross-regional cooperation is in the ascendant, and the construction of interconnection is accelerating, showing a strong momentum of competition and competition. Asia already has one-third of the world’s total economic volume and is one of the most dynamic and potential regions in the world today. Its status in the global strategic situation has further increased. Over the past 70 years, Asian countries have gradually surpassed the differences in ideology and social systems, from mutual closure to openness and tolerance, from suspicion of estrangement to increasing mutual trust and recognition, and have become more and more a community of destiny among you and me. In the great struggle for national independence, in the difficult moments of coping with the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis, and at the critical moment of fighting the Indian Ocean tsunami and the Wenchuan earthquake in China, the people of Asian countries watched and helped each other to overcome and overcome one difficulty after another. The challenge and the strength of showing strength in the same boat and overcoming difficulties and difficulties can be described as true in times of trouble. At the same time, there are still some issues left over from history and conflicts in reality in the Asian region. Faced with various traditional and non-traditional security threats, the tasks of regional countries to develop economy, improve people's livelihood and eliminate poverty are still arduous. Looking back on the course of 70 years, the development achievements made in Asia today are the result of the continuous struggle of people of all Asian countries from generation to generation and the hard work of many politicians and people with lofty ideals. Tomorrow, Singapore will hold a state funeral for Mr. Li Guangyao. Mr. Li Guangyao is a strategist and politician respected by the international community and has made outstanding contributions to peace and development in Asia and exchanges and cooperation between Asia and the world. I take this opportunity to pay high tribute to all the sages who contributed to the peaceful development of Asia, including Mr. Li Guangyao. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Asia is the Asia of the world. To move towards a community of shared destiny and create a new future for Asia, Asia must advance at the pace of world advancement and develop in the trend of world development. At present, the international situation continues to undergo profound and complex changes. The world is becoming more polarized and economic globalization is developing in depth. Cultural diversity and social informatization are continuing to advance. The international pattern and international order are accelerating the adjustment and evolution. Countries around the world are stepping up adjustments to their respective development strategies to promote changeDiversification and social informatization continue to advance, and the international pattern and international order are accelerating adjustment and evolution. Countries around the world are paying close attention to adjusting their respective development strategies, promoting reform and innovation, transforming the mode of economic development, adjusting the economic structure, and opening up new development space. At the same time, the world economy is still in a period of deep adjustment. Low growth, low inflation, and low demand are intertwined with risks such as high unemployment, high debt, and high bubbles. The trend and policy orientation of major economies continue to diverge, and the uncertainty of the economic environment remains outstanding; Geopolitical factors have become more prominent, and local turbulence has followed one after another; non-traditional security and global challenges such as terrorism, cyber security, energy security, food security, climate change, and major infectious diseases have continued to increase, and the gap between North and South development is still large. The lofty cause of advancing human peace and development still has a long way to go. , humankind has only one Earth, each nation coexist in one world. The world is good, Asia is good; Asia is good, the world is good. Facing the changing international and regional situation, we must grasp the general trend of the world, keep up with the trend of the times, jointly create a regional order that is more beneficial to Asia and the world, and promote the building of a community of human destiny by moving towards the community of Asian destiny. Taking this opportunity, I would like to talk about this point of view and exchange views with guests. ——Towards a community of shared destiny, we must insist that all countries respect each other and treat each other as equals. All countries have different sizes, strengths and weaknesses, and development priorities, but they are all equal members of the international community and have equal rights to participate in regional and international affairs. Matters involving everyone should be discussed by all countries. Being a big country means greater responsibility for regional and world peace and development, not a greater monopoly on regional and international affairs. To treat each other with respect and equality, we must first respect the social system and development path independently chosen by each country, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, view the development and growth of other countries and policy concepts in an objective and rational manner, and strive to seek common ground while reserving differences and assimilation. It is necessary to jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability situation and good development momentum in Asia, oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and oppose disruption of the regional situation for one’s own self. ——Towards a community of shared destiny, we must adhere to win-win cooperation and common development. Southeast Asian friends say ""water rises, lotus is high"", African friends say ""walk alone, people travel far"", European friends say ""a tree can't stop the cold wind"", Chinese people say ""big rivers are full of water, small rivers are full, small rivers are full of water"" full"". All this is true. Only cooperation and win-win can do great things, good things, and long-term things. It is necessary to abandon the old thinking of zero-sum games and you win and lose, establish a new concept of win-win and win-win situation, take into account the interests of others while pursuing your own interests, and promote common development when seeking your own development. The concept of win-win cooperation is not only applicable to the economic field, but also applicable to a wide range of fields such as politics, security, and culture; it is not only applicable to regional countries, but also applicable to cooperation with countries outside the region. We must strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, prevent possible negative spillover effects from changes in economic policies of different economies, actively promote global economic governance reform, maintain an open world economic system, and jointly address risks and challenges in the world economy. China and ASEAN countries work together to build a closer China-ASEAN Community of Destiny. ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea are committed to building the East Asian Economic Community by 2020. We must actively build an Asian free trade network and strive to complete the China-ASEAN free trade zone upgrade negotiations and regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement negotiations in 2015. While advancing Asian economic integration, we must adhere to open regionalism and coordinate the promotion of cross-regional cooperation, including APEC. We should actively promote the establishment of a regional financial cooperation system, discuss the establishment of an exchange and cooperation platform for Asian financial institutions, and promote complementary and coordinated development of Asian infrastructure investment banks and multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. It is necessary to strengthen pragmatic cooperation in the areas of currency stability, investment and financing, and credit rating, to promote the construction of the multilateral mechanism proposed by Chiang Mai, and to build a regional financial safety net. It is necessary to promote the establishment of a cooperation mechanism for energy resources in Asia to ensure the safety of energy resources. , China proposes to accelerate the formulation of the East Asia and Asia connectivity plan, and promote the comprehensive integration of infrastructure, policies and regulations, and personnel exchanges. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of maritime interconnection, advance the construction of the Asian ocean cooperation mechanism, promote cooperation in various fields such as ocean economy, environmental protection, disaster management, and fishery, and make the ocean a sea of ​​peace, friendship, and cooperation connecting Asian countries. ——Towards a community of shared destiny, we must insist on achieving common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. In today's world, the connotation and extension of security are more abundant, the space-time field is broader, and various factors are more complicated. The destiny of people of all countries depends on each other. In today's world, no country can achieve its own security that is separate from world security, nor is it based on the insecurity of other countries. We have to abandonIn today's world, no country can achieve its own security that is separate from world security, nor is it based on the insecurity of other countries. We must abandon the Cold War mentality, innovate the concept of security, and strive to embark on a road of Asian security that builds, shares and wins together. All countries have equal rights to participate in regional security affairs, and all have the responsibility to maintain regional security. The reasonable security concerns of each country should be respected and guaranteed. It is necessary to consider the historical latitude and longitude and realities of Asian security issues in a holistic manner, take a multi-pronged approach, take comprehensive measures, coordinate and promote regional security governance, and coordinate and maintain security in traditional and non-traditional areas. It is necessary to promote security in all countries and the region through dialogue and cooperation, seek peace through cooperation and promote security through cooperation, insist on peaceful settlement of disputes, and oppose the frequent use or threat of force. We must insist on equal emphasis on development and security, and promote sustainable security with sustainable development. Asian countries should strengthen cooperation with countries in other regions and relevant organizations, and welcome all parties to play an active and constructive role in Asian development and security. , ——Towards a community of shared destiny, we must adhere to the inclusiveness of different civilizations and exchange and learn from each other. In the long rivers of history, such as the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins in Asia, the Indus and Ganges river basins, the Euphrates and Tigris river basins, and Southeast Asia, many ancient civilizations have been bred in each other. In today's Asia, the characteristics of diversity are still very prominent. Different civilizations, different nationalities, and different religions have gathered together to form a colorful Asian family. , Mencius, an ancient Chinese thinker, said: ""The difference between husband and wife, and the emotion of things."" Different civilizations have no advantages or disadvantages, only differences in characteristics. It is necessary to promote exchanges and dialogues between different civilizations and different development models, learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses in the comparison of competition, and develop together through exchanges and mutual learning, so that civilizational exchanges and mutual learning can serve as a bridge to enhance friendship between peoples of all countries, promote the progress of human society, and maintain world peace. China proposes to convene the Asian Civilization Dialogue Conference to strengthen exchanges among youth, non-governmental organizations, localities, the media, and other sectors, to build a think tank exchange and cooperation network, to allow Asian people to enjoy a more spiritual life, and to make regional development cooperation more vibrant. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Chinese people are working in accordance with the strategic layout of building a well-off society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly, and work together to achieve the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation struggle. Taking this opportunity, I would like to reiterate that on the way forward, China will adhere to peaceful development and its determination will not be shaken; adhere to common development, and its philosophy will not be shaken; adhere to Asia-Pacific cooperative development, and its policy will not be shaken. , China's economic development has entered a new normal, and is changing from high-speed growth to medium- and high-speed growth, from scale-speed type extensive growth to quality-efficiency intensive growth, and from factor investment-driven to innovation-driven. In 2014, the Chinese economy achieved a growth of 7.4%, labor productivity increased by 7%, energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 4.8%, the domestic consumption contribution increased, the development of the service industry accelerated, and the quality and efficiency of development continued to improve. When we look at the Chinese economy, we can't just look at the growth rate. The Chinese economy is constantly increasing. The economic increase of about 7% is already considerable. The kinetic energy of the accumulation cannot be reached by double-digit growth in the past. China has a large economy, good resilience, ample potential, ample room for maneuver, and many policy tools. China will actively adapt to and lead the new normal of economic development, insist on improving the quality and efficiency of economic development as the center, place the restructuring and restructuring in a more important position, promote economic development more solidly, deepen reform and opening up more firmly, and fully Stimulate creative vitality, maintain fairness and justice more effectively, protect and improve people's livelihood more effectively, and promote the stable and healthy development of the economy and society. China's economic development has entered a new normal and will continue to provide more markets, growth, investment, and cooperation opportunities to countries in the world, including Asian countries. In the next five years, China’s imports will exceed US$10 trillion, foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and the number of outbound tourists will exceed 500 million. China will adhere to the basic national policy of opening to the outside world, continuously improve the domestic investment environment, protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors, and work with you to jointly drive the development of Asia and continue to drive towards a brighter future. China needs the harmonious and stable domestic environment and the peaceful international environment most. Any turbulence and war are not in the fundamental interest of the Chinese people. The Chinese nation has always loved peace. Since ancient times, it has been advocating the ideas of ""valuing harmony"", ""concordance of all nations"", and ""all brothers in the world"". China has suffered more than 100 years of turbulence and war since modern times. The Chinese people will never impose the tragic experience they have suffered on other countries and nations. Throughout history, any country triedDuring the turbulence and war of the year, the Chinese people will never impose the tragic experience they have suffered on other countries and nations. Throughout history, any country trying to achieve its development goals by force will eventually fail. China will unswervingly adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace, adhere to the path of peaceful development, adhere to the open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, uphold the correct concept of justice and benefit, promote the establishment of a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core, and always do world peace. , A firm force to promote common development. , ""Distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors."" This is a simple life principle that the Chinese have long recognized. China adheres to the concept of being good neighbors, taking neighbors as companions, adhering to good-neighborliness, safety and prosperity, and adhering to the concept of sincerity and mutual benefit. . China has signed good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaties with eight neighboring countries, and is negotiating to sign the China-ASEAN good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaty. It is willing to sign a good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaty with all neighboring countries to provide a strong guarantee for the development of bilateral relations and regional prosperity and stability. , When I visited Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013, I proposed the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Cooperation Initiative. The ""Belt and Road"" cooperation initiative meets the development needs of China, the countries along the route and the region, serves the common interests of all parties concerned, and conforms to the trend of regional and global cooperation. The construction of the “Belt and Road” adheres to the principles of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing. It is not closed but open and inclusive; it is not a solo of the Chinese family, but a chorus of countries along the route. The construction of the “Belt and Road” is not to replace existing regional cooperation mechanisms and initiatives, but to promote the interconnection of development strategies and complementary advantages of the countries along the route on the existing basis. At present, more than 60 countries and international organizations have expressed positive attitudes towards participating in the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. The construction of the “Belt and Road” and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are all open. We welcome the active participation of the countries along the route and Asian countries, and we welcome our friends from all five continents to join in the grand event. The construction of the “Belt and Road” is not an empty slogan, but a practical measure that can be seen and touched, and will bring tangible benefits to regional countries. With the concerted efforts of all parties concerned, the vision and action documents for the construction of the “Belt and Road” have been formulated. Substantial steps have been taken in the preparation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Silk Road Fund has been successfully launched and a number of infrastructure interconnection projects have been launched. Steady progress. These early gains show us the broad prospects of the “Belt and Road” initiative. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The cause of human peace and development is a lofty cause and a cause full of challenges. The road ahead will not be smooth, and the desired results will not be within reach. No matter how twisty or long the journey is, victory always belongs to those who never give up, persevere, and go hand in hand. I believe that as long as we all recognize our goals and persevere, we will certainly be able to work together towards a community of fate and create a new future for Asia! , Finally, I wish the annual meeting a complete success! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Boao, Hainan, March 28th), ""People's Daily"" (March 29, 2015, 02 edition),]",Towards a community of destiny and create a new future for Asia,5500,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2015-03-29,"[, 尊敬的各位元首，各位政府首脑，, 各位部长，各位国际和地区组织负责人，, 尊敬的博鳌亚洲论坛理事会各位成员，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天的博鳌，海阔帆舞，天高风暖。在这个美好的季节里，各方嘉宾相聚一堂，共商亚洲和亚洲同世界各地区发展大计，具有十分重要的意义。, 首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，对各位嘉宾出席博鳌亚洲论坛2015年年会，表示诚挚的欢迎！对年会的召开，表示热烈的祝贺！, 本届博鳌亚洲论坛年会以“亚洲新未来：迈向命运共同体”为主题，可谓恰逢其时，既有重要的现实意义，也有长远的历史意义。希望大家畅所欲言，为亚洲和世界和平与发展贡献真知灼见。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 历史，总是在一些重要时间节点上更能勾起人们的回忆和反思。今年是世界反法西斯战争暨中国人民抗日战争胜利70周年，联合国成立70周年，万隆会议召开60周年，东盟共同体建成之年。这是值得人们纪念的重要年份，也是激发人们铭记历史、鉴往知来的重要时刻。, 70年来，世界发生了前所未有的深刻变化，历史性地改变了人类的命运。全球殖民体系土崩瓦解，冷战对峙不复存在，各国相互联系、相互依存日益加深，和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流滚滚向前，国际力量对比朝着有利于维护世界和平的方向发展，保持国际形势总体稳定、促进各国共同发展具备更多有利条件。, 70年来，亚洲形势也发生了前所未有的变化。地区各国实现了民族独立、掌握了自己的命运，壮大了维护地区和世界和平的力量。亚洲国家率先倡导和平共处五项原则，并同非洲国家一道，在万隆会议上提出处理国家间关系的十项原则。冷战结束后，亚洲国家在推进区域合作实践中逐步形成相互尊重、协商一致、照顾各方舒适度的亚洲方式。这些都为正确处理国家关系、推动建立新型国际关系作出了历史性贡献。, 70年来，越来越多的亚洲国家找到适合本国国情的发展道路，从贫穷落后走向发展振兴，步入经济发展快车道。区域和跨区域合作方兴未艾，互联互通建设加速推进，呈现千帆竞发、百舸争流的强劲势头。亚洲已经拥有世界三分之一的经济总量，是当今世界最具发展活力和潜力的地区之一，在世界战略全局中的地位进一步上升。, 70年来，亚洲国家逐步超越意识形态和社会制度差异，从相互封闭到开放包容，从猜忌隔阂到日益增多的互信认同，越来越成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。在争取民族独立的伟大斗争中，在应对亚洲金融危机和国际金融危机的艰难时刻，在抗击印度洋海啸和中国汶川特大地震等灾害的紧要关头，亚洲各国人民守望相助，克服和战胜了一个又一个困难和挑战，展现出同舟共济、共克时艰的强大力量，正可谓患难见真情。同时，亚洲地区仍然存在一些历史遗留问题和现实矛盾分歧，面临各类传统和非传统安全威胁，地区国家发展经济、改善民生、消除贫困的任务依然艰巨。, 回顾70年的历程，今天亚洲取得的发展成就，是亚洲各国人民一代接一代持续奋斗的结果，是许多政治家和仁人志士艰辛努力的结果。明天，新加坡将为李光耀先生举行国葬。李光耀先生是受到国际社会尊重的战略家和政治家，为亚洲和平与发展以及亚洲同世界的交流合作作出了突出贡献。借此机会，我向包括李光耀先生在内的所有为亚洲和平发展作出贡献的先贤们，致以崇高的敬意。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 亚洲是世界的亚洲。亚洲要迈向命运共同体、开创亚洲新未来，必须在世界前进的步伐中前进、在世界发展的潮流中发展。, 当前，国际形势继续发生深刻复杂变化，世界多极化、经济全球化深入发展，文化多样化、社会信息化持续推进，国际格局和国际秩序加速调整演变。世界各国正抓紧调整各自发展战略，推动变革创新，转变经济发展方式，调整经济结构，开拓新的发展空间。同时，世界经济仍处于深度调整期，低增长、低通胀、低需求同高失业、高债务、高泡沫等风险交织，主要经济体走势和政策取向继续分化，经济环境的不确定性依然突出；地缘政治因素更加突出，局部动荡此起彼伏；恐怖主义、网络安全、能源安全、粮食安全、气候变化、重大传染性疾病等非传统安全和全球性挑战不断增多，南北发展差距依然很大。推进人类和平与发展的崇高事业依然任重而道远。, 人类只有一个地球，各国共处一个世界。世界好，亚洲才能好；亚洲好，世界才能好。面对风云变幻的国际和地区形势，我们要把握世界大势，跟上时代潮流，共同营造对亚洲、对世界都更为有利的地区秩序，通过迈向亚洲命运共同体，推动建设人类命运共同体。借此机会，我愿就此谈一谈看法，同各位嘉宾交流。, ——迈向命运共同体，必须坚持各国相互尊重、平等相待。各国体量有大小、国力有强弱、发展有先后，但都是国际社会平等一员，都有平等参与地区和国际事务的权利。涉及大家的事情要由各国共同商量来办。作为大国，意味着对地区和世界和平与发展的更大责任，而不是对地区和国际事务的更大垄断。, 相互尊重、平等相待，首先要尊重各国自主选择的社会制度和发展道路，尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切，客观理性看待别国发展壮大和政策理念，努力求同存异、聚同化异。要共同维护亚洲来之不易的和平稳定局面和良好发展势头，反对干涉别国内政，反对为一己之私搞乱地区形势。, ——迈向命运共同体，必须坚持合作共赢、共同发展。东南亚朋友讲“水涨荷花高”，非洲朋友讲“独行快，众行远”，欧洲朋友讲“一棵树挡不住寒风”，中国人讲“大河有水小河满，小河有水大河满”。这些说的都是一个道理，只有合作共赢才能办大事、办好事、办长久之事。要摒弃零和游戏、你输我赢的旧思维，树立双赢、共赢的新理念，在追求自身利益时兼顾他方利益，在寻求自身发展时促进共同发展。合作共赢的理念不仅适用于经济领域，也适用于政治、安全、文化等广泛领域；不仅适用于地区国家之间，也适用于同域外国家开展合作。要加强宏观经济政策协调，防范不同经济体经济政策变动可能带来的负面外溢效应，积极推动全球经济治理变革，维护开放型世界经济体制，共同应对世界经济中的风险和挑战。, 中国和东盟国家携手建设更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体，东盟和中国、日本、韩国致力于2020年建成东亚经济共同体。我们要积极构建亚洲自由贸易网络，争取在2015年完成中国—东盟自由贸易区升级谈判和区域全面经济伙伴关系协定谈判。在推进亚洲经济一体化的同时，我们要坚持开放的区域主义，协调推进包括亚太经合组织在内的跨区域合作。, 我们要积极推动构建地区金融合作体系，探讨搭建亚洲金融机构交流合作平台，推动亚洲基础设施投资银行同亚洲开发银行、世界银行等多边金融机构互补共进、协调发展。要加强在货币稳定、投融资、信用评级等领域务实合作，推进清迈倡议多边化机制建设，建设地区金融安全网。要推动建设亚洲能源资源合作机制，保障能源资源安全。, 中方倡议加快制定东亚和亚洲互联互通规划，促进基础设施、政策规制、人员往来全面融合。要加强海上互联互通建设，推进亚洲海洋合作机制建设，促进海洋经济、环保、灾害管理、渔业等各领域合作，使海洋成为连接亚洲国家的和平、友好、合作之海。, ——迈向命运共同体，必须坚持实现共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全。当今世界，安全的内涵和外延更加丰富，时空领域更加宽广，各种因素更加错综复杂。各国人民命运与共、唇齿相依。当今世界，没有一个国家能实现脱离世界安全的自身安全，也没有建立在其他国家不安全基础上的安全。我们要摒弃冷战思维，创新安全理念，努力走出一条共建、共享、共赢的亚洲安全之路。, 各国都有平等参与地区安全事务的权利，也都有维护地区安全的责任，每一个国家的合理安全关切都应该得到尊重和保障。要通盘考虑亚洲安全问题的历史经纬和现实状况，多管齐下、综合施策，协调推进地区安全治理，统筹维护传统和非传统领域安全。要通过对话合作促进各国和本地区安全，以合作谋和平、以合作促安全，坚持以和平方式解决争端，反对动辄使用武力或以武力相威胁。要坚持发展和安全并重，以可持续发展促进可持续安全。亚洲国家要加强同其他地区国家和有关组织合作，欢迎各方为亚洲发展和安全发挥积极和建设性作用。, ——迈向命运共同体，必须坚持不同文明兼容并蓄、交流互鉴。在漫长历史长河中，如亚洲的黄河和长江流域、印度河和恒河流域、幼发拉底河和底格里斯河流域以及东南亚等地区孕育了众多古老文明，彼此交相辉映、相得益彰，为人类文明进步作出了重要贡献。今天的亚洲，多样性的特点仍十分突出，不同文明、不同民族、不同宗教汇聚交融，共同组成多彩多姿的亚洲大家庭。, 中国古代思想家孟子说过：“夫物之不齐，物之情也。”不同文明没有优劣之分，只有特色之别。要促进不同文明不同发展模式交流对话，在竞争比较中取长补短，在交流互鉴中共同发展，让文明交流互鉴成为增进各国人民友谊的桥梁、推动人类社会进步的动力、维护世界和平的纽带。, 中方倡议召开亚洲文明对话大会，加强青少年、民间团体、地方、媒体等各界交流，打造智库交流合作网络，让亚洲人民享受更富内涵的精神生活，让地区发展合作更加活力四射。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国人民正在按照全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党的战略布局，齐心协力为实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。借此机会，我愿重申，在前进道路上，中国坚持和平发展，决心不会动摇；坚持共同发展，理念不会动摇；坚持亚太合作发展，政策不会动摇。, 中国经济发展进入新常态，正从高速增长转为中高速增长，从规模速度型粗放增长转向质量效率型集约增长，从要素投资驱动转向创新驱动。2014年，中国经济实现了7.4%的增长，劳动生产率提高了7%，单位国内生产总值能耗下降了4.8%，国内消费贡献度上升，服务业发展加快，发展质量和效益不断提高。我们看中国经济，不能只看增长率，中国经济体量不断增大，现在增长7%左右的经济增量已相当可观，集聚的动能是过去两位数的增长都达不到的。中国经济体量大、韧性好、潜力足、回旋空间大、政策工具多。中国将主动适应和引领经济发展新常态，坚持以提高经济发展质量和效益为中心，把转方式调结构放到更加重要位置，更加扎实地推进经济发展，更加坚定地深化改革开放，更加充分地激发创造活力，更加有效地维护公平正义，更加有力地保障和改善民生，促进经济社会平稳健康发展。, 中国经济发展进入新常态，将继续给包括亚洲国家在内的世界各国提供更多市场、增长、投资、合作机遇。未来5年，中国进口商品将超过10万亿美元，对外投资将超过5000亿美元，出境旅游人数将超过5亿人次。中国将坚持对外开放的基本国策，不断完善国内投资环境，保护投资者合法权益，同大家一起，共同驱动亚洲发展的列车，不断驶向更加光明的未来。, 中国最需要和谐稳定的国内环境与和平安宁的国际环境，任何动荡和战争都不符合中国人民根本利益。中华民族历来爱好和平，自古就崇尚“以和为贵”、“协和万邦”、“四海之内皆兄弟也”等思想。中国近代以后遭遇了100多年的动荡和战火，中国人民绝不会将自己曾经遭受过的悲惨经历强加给其他国家和民族。纵观历史，任何国家试图通过武力实现自己的发展目标，最终都是要失败的。中国将毫不动摇坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持走和平发展道路，坚持互利共赢的开放战略，秉持正确义利观，推动建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，始终做维护世界和平、促进共同发展的坚定力量。, “远亲不如近邻。”这是中国人很早就认识到的一个朴素的生活道理。中国坚持与邻为善、以邻为伴，坚持睦邻、安邻、富邻，秉持亲诚惠容的理念，不断深化同周边国家的互利合作和互联互通，努力使自身发展更好惠及周边国家。中国已经同8个周边国家签署睦邻友好合作条约，正在商谈签署中国—东盟睦邻友好合作条约，并愿同所有周边国家商签睦邻友好合作条约，为双边关系发展和地区繁荣稳定提供有力保障。, 2013年我访问哈萨克斯坦和印度尼西亚时，分别提出建设丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路合作倡议。“一带一路”合作倡议契合中国、沿线国家和本地区发展需要，符合有关各方共同利益，顺应了地区和全球合作潮流。, “一带一路”建设秉持的是共商、共建、共享原则，不是封闭的，而是开放包容的；不是中国一家的独奏，而是沿线国家的合唱。“一带一路”建设不是要替代现有地区合作机制和倡议，而是要在已有基础上，推动沿线国家实现发展战略相互对接、优势互补。目前，已经有60多个沿线国家和国际组织对参与“一带一路”建设表达了积极态度。“一带一路”建设、亚洲基础设施投资银行都是开放的，我们欢迎沿线国家和亚洲国家积极参与，也张开臂膀欢迎五大洲朋友共襄盛举。, “一带一路”建设不是空洞的口号，而是看得见、摸得着的实际举措，将给地区国家带来实实在在的利益。在有关各方共同努力下，“一带一路”建设的愿景与行动文件已经制定，亚洲基础设施投资银行筹建工作迈出实质性步伐，丝路基金已经顺利启动，一批基础设施互联互通项目已在稳步推进。这些早期收获向我们展现了“一带一路”的广阔前景。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 人类和平与发展的事业是崇高的事业，也是充满挑战的事业。前进的道路不会一帆风顺，期望的成果不会唾手可得。不管征程多么曲折、多么漫长，胜利总是属于那些永不放弃、百折不挠、携手前行的人们。我相信，只要我们大家认准目标、锲而不舍，就一定能携手迈向命运共同体、开创亚洲新未来！, 最后，预祝年会取得圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社海南博鳌3月28日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年03月29日 02

32,162,"[, Dear Dr. Kissinger, Dear Governor of Insley, Minister of Pritzker, Mayor of Murray, Dear Chairman of Hills, Chairman of Fields,, Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends :, Hello everyone! Thank you Dr. Kissinger for your introduction. Dr. Kissinger can always give some new ideas. His introduction gives me a new perspective on myself. Washington State and Seattle are my first stop on my state visit to the United States. I am very happy to have the opportunity to gather here with new and old friends. First of all, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and good wishes to all of you here and through you to the American people! , I am no stranger to Washington State and Seattle. It is often said that Washington State is the “Evergreen State” and Seattle is the “Emerald City”. Here are the majestic and tall Mount Rainier and the wavy Lake Washington. The movie ""Sleepless Night in Seattle"" makes this city very attractive to Chinese people. At present, Washington State's exports to China rank first in the United States, and China has become the largest trading partner of the Port of Seattle. Washington State and Seattle have become an important symbol of friendship between the Chinese and American people and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States. , The more the merrier. The development of Sino-US relations is inseparable from the hard work and careful care of the governments, localities, friendly groups, and people from all walks of life. In particular, the U.S.-China Relations National Committee, U.S.-China Trade National Committee, U.S.-China Policy Foundation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-China General Chamber of Commerce, Hundred People’s Association, Huamei Association, External Relations Committee, Asian Association, Brookings Institution, etc. Friendly groups and a large number of friendly people have long-term efforts to promote friendly cooperation between the two countries. The continuous development of Sino-US relations embodies everyone's efforts and sweat. Here, I would like to express my sincere respect and sincere gratitude to all local governments, social groups, universities, think tank institutions and people from all walks of life dedicated to the cause of Sino-US friendship! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, China has gone through a very extraordinary journey. Our generation of Chinese people have personal experience of this. At the end of the 1960s, when I was a teenager, I went from Beijing to a small village called Liangjiahe in Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province, China. I spent 7 years there as a farmer. At that time, the villagers and I lived in clay kilns and slept on the kang. The villagers lived in poverty and often could not eat a piece of meat for several months. I understand what folks need most! Later, I became the party branch secretary of this village and led the villagers to develop production. I understand what the people need. One thing I am looking forward to is to let the folks eat a meal and eat meat often. However, this wish was difficult to realize at the time. , This Spring Festival, I returned to this small village. Liang Jiahe built the asphalt road, the villagers lived in brick buildings and used the Internet, the old people enjoyed basic old-age care, the villagers had medical insurance, and the children could receive a good education. Of course, eating meat is no longer a problem. This made me realize more deeply that the Chinese dream is the dream of the people and must be combined with the Chinese people's longing for a better life in order to succeed. The change in the small village of Liangjiahe is a microcosm of China's social development and progress since the reform and opening up. We have spent more than 30 years to make China's economic aggregate rank second in the world, and more than 1.3 billion people have escaped from material shortages, and have reached a well-off level overall, enjoying unprecedented dignity and rights. This is not only a tremendous change in the lives of the Chinese people, but also a tremendous progress in human civilization. It is also an important contribution of China to the cause of world peace and development. At the same time, we are soberly aware that China is still the largest developing country in the world. China’s GDP per capita is only two-thirds of the global average and one-seventh of the United States, ranking around 80 in the world. According to our own standards, China still has more than 70 million poor people. According to World Bank standards, China still has more than 200 million people living below the poverty line. There are more than 70 million people with low security in urban and rural areas in China, and more than 85 million people with disabilities. In the past two years, I have visited many poor areas in China and visited many poor families. Their eyes longing for a happy life are deeply imprinted in my mind. These circumstances indicate that the Chinese people must continue to make arduous efforts to lead a better life. Development is still the number one priority of contemporary China. The primary mission of the Chinese ruling party is to concentrate on improving people’s living standards and gradually achieving common prosperity. To this end, we put forward the ""two hundred years"" struggle goal, which is to achieve GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents double by 2020 compared with 2010, to build a well-off society in an all-round way; to build a prosperous and strong democracy by the middle of this centuryIn 0 years, the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will be doubled compared with 2010, and a well-off society will be fully built. By the middle of this century, a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modernized country will be built, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be realized. Everything we do now is to achieve this established goal. To fully build a well-off society, we must comprehensively deepen reform, comprehensively govern the country according to law, and comprehensively manage the party strictly. This is the ""four comprehensive"" strategic layout we have proposed. Everyone cares about China's development trend and China's policy orientation. Here, I will make a few comments on some of the main issues. -China's economy will maintain stable and rapid development. China's economic operation remains within a reasonable range. In the first half of this year, China's economy grew by 7%, and its growth rate is still among the highest in the world. In the complex and ever-changing environment of the world’s overall economic situation, this is hard-won. At present, the economies of all countries are facing difficulties, and the Chinese economy is also facing downward pressure, but this is a problem in progress. We will make overall plans to stabilize growth, promote reform, adjust structure, benefit people's livelihood, prevent risks, strengthen and innovate macro-control, and promote economic growth to maintain a medium-to-high speed. At present, China's new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization continue to advance. The residents' savings rate is high, the consumption potential is huge, the people work hard, the proportion of middle-income people is increasing, the service industry has great room for development, and the market space and potential are very high. Big. In the future, China will pay more attention to improving the quality and efficiency of economic development, accelerating the transformation of economic development methods, adjusting economic structure, paying more attention to innovation-driven, more consumption-driven, and paying more attention to solving the problems of imbalance, uncoordination and unsustainability in economic development To rebirth the Chinese economic phoenix and maintain its strong development momentum. Some time ago, there were abnormal fluctuations in the Chinese stock market, which attracted everyone's attention. The stock market has its own rules of operation. The government's responsibility is to maintain an open, fair and just market order and prevent widespread panic. This time, the Chinese government took some measures to stabilize the market, contained panic in the stock market, and avoided a systemic risk. Similar practices have been adopted in mature markets in various countries. The Chinese stock market has entered a stage of self-repair and self-regulation. On August 11, China improved the quotation mechanism for the central parity of the RMB exchange rate and increased the market's strength in determining exchange rates. At present, the correction of RMB exchange rate deviation has achieved initial results. From the perspective of the international and domestic economic and financial situation, there is no basis for continued depreciation of the RMB exchange rate. We will adhere to market supply and demand to determine the direction of exchange rate reform and allow the RMB to float in both directions. We are opposed to engaging in competitive currency devaluation, fighting currency wars, and will not depress the RMB exchange rate to stimulate exports. Developing the capital market and improving the RMB exchange rate market pricing mechanism are the direction of China’s reforms, and will not change because of fluctuations in the stock and foreign exchange markets. -The fundamental way out for China's development lies in reform. The goal of our reforms is to promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, so that the market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources, better play the role of the government, and accelerate the development of a socialist market economy, democratic politics, advanced culture, harmonious society, and ecological civilization. In 2013, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China determined the top-level design for comprehensively deepening reforms and proposed more than 330 reform measures. In 2014, the 80 key reform tasks we identified were basically completed. In the first half of this year, we have introduced more than 70 key reform plans, and its role will gradually emerge. The brave will win at the moment of reform, and we will move forward with reform with determination to dare to bite the hard bone and dare to be involved in the danger. We unswervingly adhere to the direction of market economy reform and will continue to launch some vigorous and practical reform plans in the fields of market, taxation, finance, investment and financing, prices, opening to the outside world, and people's livelihood. , ——The door of China's opening will never be closed. Opening to the outside world is China's basic national policy. China's policy on the use of foreign capital will not change, the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises will not change, and the direction of providing better services for the investment and business development of enterprises in various countries in China will not change. China respects international business practices of non-discriminatory rules, abides by WTO principles such as national treatment, treats all market entities including foreign-invested enterprises fairly and fairly, and welcomes multinational companies to carry out various forms of cooperation with Chinese enterprises. We will promptly resolve the legitimate concerns of foreign investors, protect their legitimate rights and interests, and strive to create an open and transparent legal and policy environment, an efficient administrative environment, and a market environment of fair competition, especially to protect intellectual property rights, for us, including the United States. The countries of the world have cooperated to open up a wider space. , ——China's basic strategy of adhering to the rule of law. ""The rule of law is also the end of governance."" To comprehensively govern the country according to law is to adhere to the rule of law, govern the country by law, and promote the administration of the law, and adhere to the rule of law, the government, and the society. ""To comprehensively govern the country according to law is to adhere to the rule of law, governing by law, and advancing administration according to law, upholding the integration of the rule of law, the rule of law, and the society of the rule of law, promoting the continuous improvement of judicial credibility, and effective respect and protection of human rights. China is enacting legislation, law enforcement, and justice. Foreign institutions and enterprises will be treated fairly in other areas. We are willing to communicate with the US on the rule of law, learn from each other, and improve together. China is a firm defender of cybersecurity. China is also a victim of hacker attacks. The Chinese government will not use any Participate in, encourage or support anyone to engage in stealing business secrets. Whether it is online business secrets or hacking attacks on government networks, they are illegal and criminal acts, and should be cracked down according to laws and relevant international conventions. The international community should act in accordance with the law. The principle of mutual respect and mutual trust, and jointly build a cyberspace of peace, security, openness, and cooperation. China is willing to establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism between the two countries to combat cybercrime with the United States., China affirms the positive role of foreign nonprofit organizations as long as The activities of these organizations are good for the Chinese people. Not only will we not restrict and prohibit their activities, but we must protect their activities through law and protect their legitimate rights and interests in China. Foreign nonprofit organizations operating in China should abide by Chinese laws and follow the law. Carrying out activities.-China continues to advance the anti-corruption struggle. As I said, the iron strike needs to be hard. The iron striker mentioned here is the Communist Party of China. The fundamental purpose of the Communist Party of China is to serve the people wholeheartedly. The Communist Party of China has more than 8,700 people. Ten thousand party members, there must be some problems in the party. If we cannot solve the existing problems and let them develop, the people will not trust and support us. Therefore, we emphasize that governing the country must govern the party first Strict. For some time, we have vigorously investigated and dealt with corruption cases and insisted on fighting together with ""tigers"" and ""flies"" to meet the demands of the people. There is no power struggle and no ""house of cards"". China is willing to work actively with the international community Anti-corruption chase and escape cooperation. The Chinese people hope that in this regard, the United States will support and cooperate so that corrupt elements will never have a ""sin-avoidance paradise"" abroad. The 70th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, an important enlightenment from history is that peaceful development is the right path on earth, and all attempts to gain power and hegemony through aggression by force are against the historical trend and will fail. I realized the truth that ""a country is big, but a belligerent war will perish."" China has always pursued a defensive national defense policy and a military strategy of active defense. I would like to reiterate here that no matter where it develops, China will never seek hegemony and will never Engage in expansion. To show China’s determination to uphold peaceful development, I recently announced that China will disarm 300,000. We are willing to work with other countries to build a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core, to replace confrontation with cooperation and win monopoly with win-win , Establish new ideas for building partnerships, create new prospects for common development, and create a new situation for shared security., China is the current international Participants, builders and contributors of the system. We resolutely maintain the international order and international system centered on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Many countries in the world, especially the vast majority of developing countries, hope that the international system will develop in a more just and reasonable direction, but this is not a reversal or a new beginning, but it is keeping pace with the times and reforming and improving. This is in the common interest of all countries and all mankind. China's development benefits from the international community, and China must also contribute to global development. We promote the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"", the establishment of the Silk Road Fund, and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The purpose is to support the common development of all countries, not to seek political sphere of influence. The “Belt and Road” initiative is open and inclusive. We welcome countries and international organizations including the United States to participate in cooperation. We actively promote the process of economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region and the realization of the goal of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, which is to promote the formation of a free, open, convenient, fast, and vibrant Asia-Pacific development space. We advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable view of security, which is to work with countries in the region and the international community to maintain Asia-Pacific peace and security. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , In 2013, I met with President Obama at the Annaberg Manor and reached an important consensus on joint efforts to build a new relationship between China and the United States. This is a major strategic choice jointly made by the two parties on the basis of summing up historical experience, starting from the national conditions of the two countries and the general trend of the world. Over the past two years, the two sides have continuously promoted coordination and cooperation in various fields in accordance with the consensus reached, and have made important progress. We work together to deal with the impact of the international financial crisis and make joint efforts to promote the recovery of the world economy. We deepen pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in various fieldsMake important progress. We work together to deal with the impact of the international financial crisis and make joint efforts to promote the recovery of the world economy. We deepen pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in various fields and bring tangible benefits to the two peoples. Last year, the bilateral trade volume, the stock of two-way investment, and the total number of personnel exchanges all hit record highs. We maintain close communication and coordination on international and regional hot issues such as the Iranian nuclear, North Korean nuclear, South Sudan, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, as well as global issues such as the fight against Ebola and terrorism. ""Don't say anything, do it yourself."" These fruitful ""trans-Pacific cooperation"" have effectively demonstrated the vigorous vitality and huge potential of the development of Sino-US relations. , How to promote the new Sino-US relations of great powers at a new starting point? How should China and the US work together to promote world peace and development? The answer is to stick to the correct direction of building a new relationship between China and the United States and move forward step by step. The ancient Chinese said: ""The past, the experience, the ordinary things, but it is decided."" Among them, there are a few things to do especially well. , First, correctly judge each other's strategic intentions. It is the priority of China's foreign policy to build a new type of major power relationship with the United States and achieve non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. We are willing to deepen our understanding of each other's strategic direction and development path with the US side, to have more understanding, less estrangement, more trust and less suspicion, to prevent strategic misunderstandings and misjudgments. We must persist on the basis of facts and prevent three people from becoming tigers. We also do not doubt neighbors and axes. There is no ""Thucydides trap"" in the world, but repeated strategic misjudgments among major powers may cause themselves a ""Thucydides trap."" Secondly, unswervingly promote win-win cooperation. Cooperation is the only correct choice to realize benefits. To cooperate, we must take care of each other’s interests and concerns, and seek the greatest common denominator of cooperation. The cooperation between China and the United States will become a ballast stone for world stability and a booster for world peace. The Sino-US conflict and confrontation is definitely a disaster for the two countries and the world. The fields in which China and the United States should be able to cooperate are very broad. We should promote and improve the global governance mechanism, jointly promote the stable growth of the world economy, and jointly maintain the stability of the global financial market. We should negotiate a two-way balanced and high-level bilateral investment agreement at an early date, deepen the construction of new Sino-US military relations, expand pragmatic cooperation in clean energy, environmental protection and other fields, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in law enforcement and anti-corruption, health, local and other fields, Tap the potential for cooperation in infrastructure construction. We should deepen communication and cooperation on multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, APEC, and the G20, as well as major international and regional issues and global challenges, and make greater contributions to maintaining and promoting world peace, stability, and prosperity. , Third, properly and effectively manage differences. ""The sun and moon are different, and the day and night are different."" It is precisely because of the difference that the world is colorful; also because of the differences, it is necessary to gather and assimilate. Contradictions are universal, and a pure and pure world does not exist. It is inevitable that China and the United States have different views and differences on some issues. The key is how to control them. The most important thing is that both parties should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, adopt constructive methods to enhance understanding and expand consensus, and strive to turn contradictions into cooperation. Fourthly, cultivate people's friendship extensively. In the final analysis, the relationship between the people is the relationship between the people. Although China and the United States are far apart, the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have a long history. More than 230 years ago, the US merchant ship ""Queen of China"" made its first voyage to China across the ocean. 150 years ago, tens of thousands of Chinese workers, together with the American people, laid the trans-U.S. Pacific Railway. 70 years ago, China and the United States fought side by side as an ally of the Second World War, and jointly safeguarded world peace and justice. In that war, thousands of American soldiers gave their precious lives to the just cause of the Chinese people. We will not forget the moral support and valuable assistance that the American people have given to the Chinese people in fighting against aggression, winning freedom and independence. The Chinese people have always admired the enterprising spirit and creative spirit of the American people. I have read ""Federalist Collected Works"" and Thomas Paine's ""Common Knowledge"" in my youth. I also like to understand the life and ideas of American politicians such as Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. I also read Thoreau, Whitman, Works by Mark Twain, Jack London and others. Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" impressed me with the description of the gusty winds and rainstorms, the huge waves and the boats, the old man and the sharks. I went to Cuba for the first time and made a special trip to the trestle where Hemingway wrote ""Old Man and the Sea"". The second time I went to Cuba, I went to the bar Hemingway frequented, and ordered Hemingway's favorite rum with mint leaves and ice cubes. I want to experience the spiritual world and field atmosphere when Hemingway wrote those stories. I think that we need to understand more about different cultures and civilizations. , In HanThe spiritual world and field atmosphere when Hemingway wrote those stories. I think that we need to understand more about different cultures and civilizations. , In Chinese characters, the word ""person"" is a mutually supporting shape. The friendship between China and the United States is based on the people and hopes on youth. I would like to announce here that China supports the exchange of 50,000 international students between the two countries in the next three years to study in the other country. China and the United States will hold the ""China-US Tourism Year"" in 2016. China will create more convenient conditions for friendly exchanges between the two peoples. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Dr. Kissinger said in his book ""World Order"": ""When judging each generation, it depends on whether they face the most ambitious and important issues of human society."" Martin Luther King also said: ""Doing the right thing, any time is a good time."" Today, we once again come to a critical historical moment. Let us join hands to jointly create a better future for China-US relations and make greater contributions to the happiness of the people of China and the United States and the happiness of people of all countries in the world! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Seattle, United States, September 22nd), ""People's Daily"" (September 24, 2015, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the joint

女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！谢谢基辛格博士的介绍。基辛格博士总能说出一些新颖的观点，他的介绍让我对自己也有了一个新的认识角度。华盛顿州、西雅图市是我对美国进行国事访问的第一站，有机会在这里同各位新老朋友欢聚一堂，感到十分高兴。首先，我谨向在座各位，并通过你们向美国人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 我对华盛顿州和西雅图市并不陌生。人们常说，华盛顿州是“常青之州”，西雅图市是“翡翠之城”。这里有雄伟挺拔的雷尼尔山、波光潋滟的华盛顿湖。电影《西雅图不眠夜》使这座城市在中国民众中有很大吸引力。目前，华盛顿州对华出口居全美之首，中国也成为西雅图港最大贸易伙伴。华盛顿州和西雅图市成为中美人民友谊、中美互利合作的一个重要象征。, 众人拾柴火焰高。中美关系发展，离不开两国政府、地方、友好团体、各界人士的辛勤耕耘和精心呵护。特别是美中关系全国委员会、美中贸易全国委员会、美中政策基金会、美国商会、美国中国总商会、百人会、华美协进社、对外关系委员会、亚洲协会、布鲁金斯学会等友好团体和一大批友好人士，长期为促进两国友好合作奔走努力。中美关系持续发展，凝聚着大家的心血和汗水。在这里，我谨向所有致力于中美友好事业的地方政府、社会团体、大学和智库机构及各界人士，表示由衷的敬意和诚挚的感谢！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 新中国成立以来特别是改革开放以来，中国走过了一段很不平凡的历程，我们这一代中国人对此有着切身的体会。, 上世纪60年代末，我才十几岁，就从北京到中国陕西省延安市一个叫梁家河的小村庄插队当农民，在那儿度过了7年时光。那时候，我和乡亲们都住在土窑里、睡在土炕上，乡亲们生活十分贫困，经常是几个月吃不到一块肉。我了解乡亲们最需要什么！后来，我当了这个村子的党支部书记，带领乡亲们发展生产。我了解老百姓需要什么。我很期盼的一件事，就是让乡亲们饱餐一顿肉，并且经常吃上肉。但是，这个心愿在当时是很难实现的。, 今年春节，我回到这个小村子。梁家河修起了柏油路，乡亲们住上了砖瓦房，用上了互联网，老人们享有基本养老，村民们有医疗保险，孩子们可以接受良好教育，当然吃肉已经不成问题。这使我更加深刻地认识到，中国梦是人民的梦，必须同中国人民对美好生活的向往结合起来才能取得成功。, 梁家河这个小村庄的变化，是改革开放以来中国社会发展进步的一个缩影。我们用了30多年时间，使中国经济总量跃居世界第二，13亿多人摆脱了物质短缺，总体达到小康水平，享有前所未有的尊严和权利。这不仅是中国人民生活的巨大变化，也是人类文明的巨大进步，更是中国对世界和平与发展事业的重要贡献。, 同时，我们也清醒认识到，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家。中国的人均国内生产总值仅相当于全球平均水平的三分之二、美国的七分之一，排在世界80位左右。按照我们自己的标准，中国还有7000多万贫困人口。如果按照世界银行的标准，中国则还有两亿多人生活在贫困线以下。中国城乡有7000多万低保人口，还有8500多万残疾人。这两年，我去了中国很多贫困地区，看望了很多贫困家庭，他们渴望幸福生活的眼神深深印在我的脑海里。, 这些情况表明，中国人民要过上美好生活，还要继续付出艰苦努力。发展依然是当代中国的第一要务，中国执政者的首要使命就是集中力量提高人民生活水平，逐步实现共同富裕。为此，我们提出了“两个一百年”奋斗目标，就是到2020年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比2010年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴。我们现在所做的一切，都是为了实现这个既定目标。实现全面建成小康社会，必须全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党。这就是我们提出的“四个全面”战略布局。, 大家都关心中国的发展走向，关心中国的政策取向，这里，我就其中一些主要的问题讲几点意见。, ——中国经济将保持平稳较快发展。中国经济运行仍然保持在合理区间，今年上半年，中国经济增长7%，增速仍然居世界前列。在世界总体经济形势复杂多变的环境下，这是来之不易的。当前，各国经济都面临着困难，中国经济也面临着一定下行压力，但这是前进中的问题。我们将统筹稳增长、促改革、调结构、惠民生、防风险，加强和创新宏观调控，促进经济增长保持中高速水平。现在，中国新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化持续推进，居民储蓄率高，消费潜力巨大，人民工作勤奋，中等收入者比重在提高，服务业发展空间很大，市场空间和潜力都很大。今后，中国将更重视提高经济发展质量和效益，加快转变经济发展方式、调整经济结构，更加注重创新驱动，更加注重消费拉动，更加注重解决经济发展中存在的不平衡、不协调、不可持续问题，使中国经济凤凰涅槃、浴火重生，保持强劲发展动力。, 前段时间，中国股市出现了异常波动，引起了大家关注。股市涨跌有其自身的运行规律。政府的职责是维护公开、公平、公正的市场秩序，防止发生大面积恐慌。这次，中国政府采取了一些稳定市场的措施，遏制了股市的恐慌情绪，避免了一次系统性风险。各国成熟市场也采取过类似做法。中国股市已经进入自我修复和自我调节阶段。8月11日，中国完善了人民币汇率中间价报价机制，加大了市场决定汇率的力度。目前，人民币汇率偏差矫正已初见成效。从国际国内经济金融形势看，人民币汇率不存在持续贬值的基础。我们将坚持市场供求决定汇率的改革方向，允许人民币双向浮动，我们反对搞货币竞争性贬值，反对打货币战，也不会压低人民币汇率刺激出口。发展资本市场、完善人民币汇率市场定价机制是中国的改革方向，不会因为这次股市、汇市波动而改变。, ——中国发展的根本出路在于改革。我们改革的目标，就是推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，加快发展社会主义市场经济、民主政治、先进文化、和谐社会、生态文明。2013年，中共十八届三中全会确定了全面深化改革的顶层设计，提出330多项改革措施。2014年，我们确定的80个重点改革任务基本完成。今年上半年，我们已经出台70多项重点改革方案，其作用将逐步显现。改革关头勇者胜，我们将以敢于啃硬骨头、敢于涉险滩的决心，义无反顾推进改革。我们坚定不移坚持市场经济改革方向，将继续在市场、财税、金融、投融资、价格、对外开放、民生等领域集中推出一些力度大、措施实的改革方案。, ——中国开放的大门永远不会关上。对外开放是中国的基本国策，中国利用外资的政策不会变，对外商投资企业合法权益的保障不会变，为各国企业在华投资兴业提供更好服务的方向不会变。中国尊重非歧视性规则的国际营商惯例，遵守国民待遇等世贸组织原则，公平公正对待包括外商投资企业在内的所有市场主体，欢迎跨国公司同中国企业开展各种形式合作。我们将及时解决外国投资者合理关切，保护他们的合法权益，努力营造公开透明的法律政策环境、高效的行政环境、平等竞争的市场环境，尤其是保护好知识产权，为我们同包括美国在内的世界各国开展合作开辟更加广阔的空间。, ——中国坚持依法治国的基本方略。“法者，治之端也。”全面依法治国就是要坚持依法治国、依法执政、依法行政共同推进，坚持法治国家、法治政府、法治社会一体建设，推动司法公信力不断提高、人权得到切实尊重和保障。中国在立法、执法、司法等领域将公平对待外国机构和企业。我们愿同美方就法治问题开展交流，相互借鉴，共同提高。, 中国是网络安全的坚定维护者。中国也是黑客攻击的受害国。中国政府不会以任何形式参与、鼓励或支持任何人从事窃取商业秘密行为。不论是网络商业窃密，还是对政府网络发起黑客攻击，都是违法犯罪行为，都应该根据法律和相关国际公约予以打击。国际社会应该本着相互尊重和相互信任的原则，共同构建和平、安全、开放、合作的网络空间。中国愿同美国建立两国共同打击网络犯罪高级别联合对话机制。, 中国肯定境外非营利组织的积极作用，只要这些组织的活动对中国人民有好处，我们不仅不会限制和禁止它们的活动，而且要通过法律保障它们的活动，保障它们在华合法权益。境外非营利组织在中国活动应该遵守中国法律，依法开展活动。, ——中国继续推进反腐败斗争。我说过，打铁还需自身硬。这里说的打铁的人，就是中国共产党。中国共产党的根本宗旨是全心全意为人民服务。中国共产党有8700多万名党员，党内也必然存在这样那样的问题。如果我们不能解决存在的问题，任其发展下去，人民就不会信任和支持我们。所以，我们强调治国必先治党、治党务必从严。一段时间以来，我们大力查处腐败案件，坚持“老虎”、“苍蝇”一起打，就是要顺应人民要求。这其中没有什么权力斗争，没有什么“纸牌屋”。中国愿同国际社会积极开展反腐追逃合作。中国人民希望在这方面得到美国支持和配合，让腐败分子在海外永无“避罪天堂”。, ——中国坚持走和平发展道路。我们刚刚纪念了中国人民抗日战争胜利暨世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年，历史给我们的一个重要启迪就是，和平发展是人间正道，一切通过武力侵略谋取强权和霸权的企图都是逆历史潮流的，都是要失败的。中国人2000多年前就认识到了“国虽大，好战必亡”的真理。中国历来奉行防御性国防政策和积极防御的军事战略。我愿在此重申，无论发展到哪一步，中国永远不称霸、永远不搞扩张。为表明中国坚持和平发展的决心，我不久前宣布中国将裁军30万。我们愿同各国一道，构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，以合作取代对抗，以共赢取代独占，树立建设伙伴关系新思路，开创共同发展新前景，营造共享安全新局面。, 中国是现行国际体系的参与者、建设者、贡献者。我们坚决维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为核心的国际秩序和国际体系。世界上很多国家特别是广大发展中国家都希望国际体系朝着更加公正合理方向发展，但这并不是推倒重来，也不是另起炉灶，而是与时俱进、改革完善。这符合世界各国和全人类共同利益。, 中国发展得益于国际社会，中国也要为全球发展作出贡献。我们推动共建“一带一路”、设立丝路基金、倡议成立亚洲基础设施投资银行等，目的是支持各国共同发展，而不是要谋求政治势力范围。“一带一路”是开放包容的，我们欢迎包括美国在内的世界各国和国际组织参与到合作中来。我们积极推动亚太区域经济一体化进程，推动实现亚太自由贸易区目标，是要推动形成自由开放、方便快捷、充满活力的亚太发展空间。我们倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，是要同地区各国以及国际社会一道，维护好亚太和平和安全。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 2013年，我同奥巴马总统在安纳伯格庄园会晤，达成共同努力构建中美新型大国关系的重要共识。这是双方在总结历史经验基础上，从两国国情和世界大势出发，共同作出的重大战略抉择。, 两年多来，双方按照达成的共识，不断推进各领域协调和合作，取得重要进展。我们携手应对国际金融危机影响，为推动世界经济复苏作出共同努力。我们深化各领域务实交流合作，给两国人民带来实实在在的利益。去年，两国双边贸易额、双向投资存量、人员往来总数都创历史新高。我们围绕伊朗核、朝核、南苏丹、阿富汗、中东等国际和地区热点问题，以及抗击埃博拉病毒、打击恐怖主义等全球性问题保持密切沟通和协调。“桃李不言，下自成蹊。”这些成果丰硕的“跨越太平洋的合作”，有力展现了中美关系发展的蓬勃生机和巨大潜力。, 如何在新起点上推进中美新型大国关系？中美应该怎样携手合作来促进世界和平与发展？答案就是要坚持构建中美新型大国关系的正确方向，一步一个脚印向前走。中国古人说：“度之往事，验之来事，参之平素，可则决之。”这其中，有几件事尤其要做好。, 第一，正确判断彼此战略意图。同美方一道构建新型大国关系，实现双方不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢，是中国外交政策优先方向。我们愿同美方加深对彼此战略走向、发展道路的了解，多一些理解、少一些隔阂，多一些信任、少一些猜忌，防止战略误解误判。我们要坚持以事实为依据，防止三人成虎，也不疑邻盗斧，不能戴着有色眼镜观察对方。世界上本无“修昔底德陷阱”，但大国之间一再发生战略误判，就可能自己给自己造成“修昔底德陷阱”。, 第二，坚定不移推进合作共赢。合作是实现利益唯一正确选择。要合作就要照顾彼此利益和关切，寻求合作最大公约数。中美两国合作好了，可以成为世界稳定的压舱石、世界和平的助推器。中美冲突和对抗，对两国和世界肯定是灾难。中美应该和能够合作的领域十分广阔。我们应该推动完善全球治理机制，共同促进世界经济稳定增长，共同维护全球金融市场稳定。我们应该早日谈成一个双向平衡、高水平的双边投资协定，深化中美新型军事关系建设，拓展在清洁能源、环保等领域务实合作，加强在执法和反腐败、卫生、地方等领域交流合作，挖掘在基础设施建设方面的合作潜力。我们应该深化在联合国、亚太经合组织、二十国集团等多边机制以及重大国际和地区问题、全球性挑战上的沟通和合作，为维护和促进世界和平、稳定、繁荣作出更大贡献。, 第三，妥善有效管控分歧。“日月不同光，昼夜各有宜。”正是因为有了差别，世界才多姿多彩；也正是因为有了分歧，才需要聚同化异。矛盾是普遍存在的，纯而又纯的世界是不存在的。中美两国在一些问题上存在不同看法、存在分歧在所难免，关键是如何管控。最关键的是双方应该相互尊重、求同存异，采取建设性方式增进理解、扩大共识，努力把矛盾点转化为合作点。, 第四，广泛培植人民友谊。国家关系归根结底是人民之间的关系。中美两国虽然相距遥远，但两国人民友好交往源远流长。230多年前，美国商船“中国皇后号”跨洋过海首航中国。150年前，数以万计的中国工人同美国人民一起，铺设了横贯东西的美国太平洋铁路。70年前，中美作为第二次世界大战盟国并肩奋战，共同捍卫了世界和平和正义。在那场战争中，数以千计的美国将士为中国人民的正义事业献出了宝贵生命。我们不会忘记美国人民为中国人民抗击侵略、赢得自由和独立给予的道义支持和宝贵援助。, 中国人民一向钦佩美国人民的进取精神和创造精神。我青年时代就读过《联邦党人文集》、托马斯·潘恩的《常识》等著作，也喜欢了解华盛顿、林肯、罗斯福等美国政治家的生平和思想，我还读过梭罗、惠特曼、马克·吐温、杰克·伦敦等人的作品。海明威《老人与海》对狂风和暴雨、巨浪和小船、老人和鲨鱼的描写给我留下了深刻印象。我第一次去古巴，专程去了海明威当年写《老人与海》的栈桥边。第二次去古巴，我去了海明威经常去的酒吧，点了海明威爱喝的朗姆酒配薄荷叶加冰块。我想体验一下当年海明威写下那些故事时的精神世界和实地氛围。我认为，对不同的文化和文明，我们需要去深入了解。, 在汉字中，“人”字就是一个相互支撑的形状。中美友好，根基在民众，希望在青年。我愿在此宣布，中方支持未来3年中美两国互派5万名留学生到对方国家学习，中美将在2016年举办“中美旅游年”。中国将为两国人民友好交往创造更多便利条件。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 基辛格博士在其著作《世界秩序》中说：“评判每一代人时，要看他们是否正视了人类社会最宏大和最重要的问题。”马丁·路德·金先生也说过：“做对的事，任何时机都是好时机。”今天，我们再次来到了关键的历史当口。让我们携起手来，共同开创中美关系更加美好的未来，为中美两国人民幸福、为世界各国人民幸福作出更大贡献！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社美国西雅图9月22日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2015年09月24日
