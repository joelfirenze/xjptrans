1,100,"[, Dear President Susilo, Dear Colleagues,, I am very pleased to discuss the world economic plan with you in beautiful Bali and seek the future of Asia-Pacific cooperation. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Susilo and the Indonesian government for their thoughtful arrangements for this meeting! At present, the world economic situation is generally developing in a good direction, but unstable and uncertain factors are still outstanding. The deep impact of the international financial crisis has not been eliminated, and cross-border financial risks cannot be ignored. The structural problems of major developed economies are far from being resolved, and the need to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination is outstanding. Some Asia-Pacific emerging market economies face increased external risks and pressures, financial market volatility and slower economic growth. The World Trade Organization's Doha Round negotiations have been slow, and trade and investment protectionism have made new developments. Achieving a comprehensive recovery and healthy growth of the world economy still faces severe challenges. APEC bears the important mission of promoting regional and global development. Faced with the above challenges, it should display courage and determination, play a leading and coordinating role, maintain and develop an open world economy, and promote the Asia-Pacific region to continue to play a role in the recovery of the world economy Engine function. First, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and join hands to promote the common development of the Asia-Pacific. In the context of economic globalization, all economies are honored and lost, and they should strive for macroeconomic policy coordination to amplify the positive linkage effect and prevent and reduce negative spillover effects. We must uphold the spirit of openness, tolerance, and win-win cooperation, and we must not step on each other's feet or even cancel each other out. The major reserve currency issuing economies should implement responsible macroeconomic policies, and they need to be cautious about the adjustment of relevant policies, especially monetary policies. Whether entering or exiting, we must consider the impact on the region and strengthen communication and coordination with other economies. . APEC should play the same role and promote the formation of an open development pattern of policy coordination, growth linkage, and integration of interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Second, objectively judge the situation, calmly respond to challenges, and spare no effort to maintain Asia-Pacific economic and financial stability. At present, changes in the world economy pose challenges to the Asia-Pacific financial markets, capital flows, and exchange rate stability, and increase the economic and financial risks of the region. We must pay attention to preventing the risk turmoil in the Asia-Pacific economic and financial turmoil caused by the overlapping of risks, and use social policies to support economic policies to prevent the evolution of economic and financial risks into political and social problems. At the same time, it should be noted that the Asia-Pacific region’s common aspirations for peace, stability, and development have not changed, the historical trend of the Asia-Pacific region’s rising position and role in the world’s political and economic territory has not changed, and the momentum for sustained and rapid economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region has not changed. The potential has not changed. Asia-Pacific economies have learned lessons from past experience, and their ability to withstand risks has increased significantly. We have reason to maintain confidence in the prospects for Asia-Pacific development. Thirdly, focus on the long-term, push members to deepen economic structural adjustment, and inject more momentum into the sustainable development of the Asia-Pacific region. People without thought, he must worry about. While solving the current problems, we must plan for the long term. The key to long-term development lies in reform and innovation. It is necessary to transform the mode of economic development, adjust the economic structure, promote reform and innovation, unleash the potential of domestic demand, the power of innovation, and the vitality of the market, and provide endogenous power for the sustained and healthy development of the economy. There is no smooth road to reform. Both developed and developing members must be prepared to pay the necessary costs for reform. Only when it is difficult can it show courage; only if it works hard, can it be precious. All economies in the Asia-Pacific region should accelerate their own economic restructuring, deepen the integration of the industrial chain and the value chain, promote the Asia-Pacific region to take the lead in forming a new growth industry cluster globally, and continue to shoulder the important responsibility of the world's economic engine. , Colleagues! The ninth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization held two months later will have an important impact on the destiny of the Doha Round negotiations and the future of the multilateral trading system. At the same time, regional trade arrangements are advancing, with different rules and standards and different paths. In this regard, I am willing to make the following propositions. First, form synergy and jointly promote the process of Asia-Pacific economic integration. China is open to any institutional arrangements conducive to Asia-Pacific regional integration. At the same time, it is believed that relevant arrangements should establish cooperative rather than antagonistic relationships, advocate openness rather than closure, seek a win-win rather than zero-sum result, and achieve the goal of integration rather than fragmentation. We should learn from each other and promote each other to form a situation of integration and complementarity. , APEC members should uphold the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency, embody flexibility, establish and start the free trade area information exchange mechanism as soon as possible, give full play to the leading and coordinating role of APEC, and promote relevant regional trade arrangements to report to APEC leaders on the progress of negotiations and Implement the situation, strengthen communication and exchange for the ultimate realizationAnd coordination, promote relevant regional trade arrangements to report the progress and implementation of negotiations to APEC leaders, strengthen communication, and create favorable conditions for the ultimate realization of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area. Second, it is committed to open development and resolutely opposes trade protectionism. Members of the economy, open to progress together, closed to trap themselves. The return of this year's meeting to the birthplace of Bogor Goals is of special significance. We must uphold the Bogor goal spirit and uphold the open regionalism, and we cannot ""leave the snow in front of each other and let others frost"". Developed members should set an example in expanding market opening, pay more attention to economic and technological cooperation, and help developing members enhance their competitiveness. Third, strengthen confidence and inject new vitality into the multilateral trading system. APEC has played an important role in ending the Uruguay Round negotiations and is a staunch supporter of the Doha Round. History has come to the same moment again. We should be brave enough to send a strong political signal to promote the Doha Round negotiations, give trade ministers more political guidance and flexibility, urge all parties to reach early gains, and be determined to complete the Doha Round comprehensively. And determine the specific road map. , Colleagues! , APEC is entering a new period of development. Standing at a new starting point in history, let us join hands and uphold the ideas of openness, tolerance, and win-win cooperation, and promote APEC to play a greater role! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Bali, Indonesia, October 7th), ""People's Daily"" (October 08, 2013, 02 edition),]",Give play to the leading role of Asia-Pacific and maintain and develop an open world economy,1948,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-10-08,"[, 尊敬的苏西洛总统，, 各位同事：, 很高兴能在美丽的巴厘岛同大家共商世界经济大计，共谋亚太合作未来。首先，我谨对苏西洛总统和印尼政府为本次会议所作的周到安排表示衷心的感谢！, 当前，世界经济形势总体朝好的方向发展，但不稳定不确定因素依然突出。国际金融危机深层次影响仍未消除，跨境金融风险不可忽视。主要发达经济体结构性问题远未解决，加强宏观经济政策协调必要性突出。一些亚太新兴市场经济体面临的外部风险和压力增大，金融市场波动，经济增速放缓。世界贸易组织多哈回合谈判进展缓慢，贸易和投资保护主义有新的发展。实现世界经济全面复苏和健康成长仍然面临严峻挑战。, 亚太经合组织承载着推动本地区和全球发展的重要使命，面对上述挑战，应该展示勇气和决心，发挥引领和协调作用，维护和发展开放型世界经济，推动亚太地区继续在世界经济复苏方面发挥引擎作用。, 第一，加强宏观经济政策协调，携手推动亚太共同发展。经济全球化背景下各经济体一荣俱荣、一损俱损，应该争取通过宏观经济政策协调，放大正面联动效应，防止和减少负面外溢效应。我们要秉持开放包容、合作共赢精神，不能互相踩脚，甚至互相抵消。主要储备货币发行经济体要实施负责任的宏观经济政策，对有关政策特别是货币政策调整尤其需要慎重，不管是进入还是退出，都要考虑对本地区的影响，加强同其他经济体的沟通和协调。, 亚太经合组织也应该发挥同样作用，推动形成亚太地区政策协调、增长联动、利益融合的开放发展格局。, 第二，客观判断形势，沉着应对挑战，全力维护亚太经济金融稳定。当前，世界经济变动对亚太金融市场、资金流动、汇率稳定带来挑战，增加了本地区经济金融风险。我们要注意防范风险叠加造成亚太经济金融大动荡，以社会政策托底经济政策，防止经济金融风险演化为政治社会问题。, 同时要看到，亚太地区谋和平、求稳定、促发展的共同愿望没有改变，亚太地区在世界政治经济版图中的地位和作用上升的历史趋势没有改变，亚太地区经济持续快速增长的动力和潜力没有改变。亚太经济体已经从过去的经历中吸取了教训，抵御风险能力显著增强。我们有理由对亚太发展前景保持信心。, 第三，着眼长远，推动各成员深化经济结构调整，为亚太持久发展注入更大动力。人无远虑，必有近忧。在解决当前问题的同时，更要谋划长远。长远发展的关键，在于改革创新。要转变经济发展方式，调整经济结构，推进改革创新，释放内需潜力、创新动力、市场活力，为经济持续健康发展提供内生动力。改革之路从无坦途，无论发达成员还是发展中成员，都要做好为改革付出必要成本的准备。惟其艰难，才更显勇毅；惟其笃行，才弥足珍贵。, 亚太各经济体应该加快自身经济结构调整，加深产业链和价值链融合，推动亚太地区在全球率先形成新的增长产业群，继续担负起世界经济引擎的重要责任。, 各位同事！, 两个月后举行的世界贸易组织第九届部长级会议，将对多哈回合谈判命运、多边贸易体制前途产生重要影响。与此同时，区域贸易安排呈现并进格局，规则标准各异、路径选择不同。对此，我愿意提出以下主张。, 一是形成合力，共同推动亚太经济一体化进程。中方对任何有利于亚太区域融合的机制安排都持开放态度。同时认为，有关安排应该建立合作而非对立的关系，倡导开放而非封闭的理念，寻求共赢而非零和的结果，实现一体化而非碎片化的目标。要相互借鉴、相互促进，形成彼此融合、互为补充的局面。, 亚太经合组织成员应该秉持开放、包容、透明原则，体现灵活性，建立并尽早启动自由贸易区信息交流机制，发挥亚太经合组织引领和协调作用，推动有关区域贸易安排向亚太经合组织领导人汇报谈判进展及落实情况，加强沟通交流，为最终实现亚太自由贸易区创造有利条件。, 二是致力于开放式发展，坚决反对贸易保护主义。各成员经济，开放则共进，封闭则自困。今年会议回归茂物目标诞生地，具有特殊意义。我们要秉持茂物目标精神，坚持开放的区域主义，不能“各家自扫门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜”。发达成员要在扩大市场开放上作好表率，更加重视经济技术合作，帮助发展中成员提升竞争力。, 三是坚定信心，为多边贸易体制注入新的活力。亚太经合组织曾经为结束乌拉圭回合谈判发挥过重要作用，更是多哈回合的坚定支持者。历史又来到了同样的时刻，我们应该勇于担当，为推动多哈回合谈判发出强有力政治信号，给予贸易部长们更多政治指导和灵活性，力促各方达成早期收获，坚定全面完成多哈回合的决心，并确定具体路线图。, 各位同事！, 亚太经合组织正在进入新的发展时期。站在历史新起点上，让我们携起手来，秉持开放包容、合作共赢的思想，推动亚太经合组织发挥更大作用！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社印度尼西亚巴厘岛10月7日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年10月08日 02 版）, ]",发挥亚太引领作用 维护和发展开放型世界经济,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/23117724
2,101,"[, Dear President Atambayev, Distinguished colleagues: I am very pleased to attend the Bishkek Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and I thank the Chairman Kyrgyzstan for the meticulous preparations and thoughtful arrangements for the smooth holding of the summit. Over the past year, Kyrgyzstan has done a lot of fruitful work to promote the development of the organization. China highly appreciates this. In the face of the latest developments and changes in the international and regional situation, and in accordance with the common demands of member states to maintain stability, develop economy, and improve people's livelihood, this summit takes the implementation of the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Member States Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty"" as the theme, and will Approving the implementation outline of the Treaty and planning a grand blueprint for the development of the Organization in the next five years will open up a broader development prospect for the Organization.

Affected by the international financial crisis, the economic development of various countries has encountered difficulties to varying degrees, and has entered a period of adjustment and recovery. It is difficult for any country to deal with these challenges alone. We must strengthen cooperation and strengthen ourselves.

A good partner with us. Second, jointly maintain regional security and stability. A safe and stable environment is a necessary condition for mutually beneficial cooperation and common development and prosperity. It is necessary to implement the ""Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism"" and the outline of cooperation, improve the organization's law enforcement and security cooperation system, endow the regional anti-terrorist organizations with anti-drug functions, and build a comprehensive center to respond to security threats and challenges on this basis. The relevant departments of member states should also establish daily information communication channels, explore joint action methods, and jointly combat the ""three forces"" to create a good environment for the production and life of people in all countries in the region. , Afghanistan is an observer country of the Organization, and the situation in Afghanistan is closely related to the security and stability of the region. This organization should support the Afghan national reconciliation process, help Afghanistan achieve peace and stability at an early date, and jointly maintain regional security. , Third, focus on developing pragmatic cooperation. Pragmatic cooperation is the material basis and driving force for the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The six member states and five observer states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are located along the ancient Silk Road. As member states and observer states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, we have a responsibility to carry forward and carry forward the spirit of the Silk Road. First, open up a large transportation and logistics channel. Sign the International Road Transport Facilitation Agreement as soon as possible. After the signing of the Agreement, it is recommended that the participation of observer countries be widely followed on a voluntary basis, so as to unblock the transportation corridor from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Second, to discuss trade and investment facilitation agreements. On the basis of taking full account of the interests and concerns of all parties, it seeks to carry out extensive cooperation in the field of trade and investment, give full play to the cooperation potential of member countries, achieve complementary advantages, and promote common development and prosperity. 3. The third is to strengthen cooperation in the financial field. Promote the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Development Bank to provide financing guarantee and settlement platforms for the organization's infrastructure construction and economic and trade cooperation projects. At the same time, set up a special account of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as soon as possible to provide financial support for project research and exchange training within the framework of the organization. Make good use of the mechanism of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Banking Consortium to strengthen exchanges and cooperation among financial institutions of various countries in the region.

Fourth, strengthen humanities and non-governmental exchanges and lay a solid foundation for public opinion and society for the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. We want to carry out extensive cooperation in the fields of culture, education, film and television, health, sports, and tourism. At the Beijing Summit, China has announced that it will provide 30,000 government scholarships to other member states in the next 10 years. We are willing to work closely with member states to implement this project. , China will set up ""China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization International Judicial Exchange at the Shanghai University of Political Science and LawWilling to work closely with member states to implement this project. China will set up a ""China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization International Judicial Exchange and Cooperation Training Base"" at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, and is willing to use this platform to train judicial talents for other member states. Traditional medicine is a new field of cooperation between all parties. China is willing to cooperate with member states to build traditional Chinese medical institutions and make full use of traditional medicine resources to serve the health of the people of member states. According to the consensus reached by all parties, China has taken the lead in establishing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Good Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Committee. It is recommended that member states and observer states also establish similar social groups to enhance mutual understanding and traditional friendship between people of all countries. The ""Bishkek Declaration"" issued by this summit has expounded the position of the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on the Syrian issue. I would like to emphasize here that China attaches great importance to the situation in Syria, supports the international community to actively promote a ceasefire and stop violence, persuade peace and promote talks, and calls on both parties to the Syrian conflict to resolve the crisis through political channels.

3,102,"[, Dear President Putin, Dear Colleagues,: It is a pleasure to meet you in beautiful St. Petersburg and discuss strategies for promoting world economic growth and employment. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Putin and the Russian government for their active efforts and thoughtful arrangements for this summit! At present, the world economy is gradually coming out of the trough, and the situation continues to develop in a good direction. At the same time, the negative impact of the international financial crisis still exists. Some countries' economies have not escaped recession, and the global economic recovery still has a long way to go. The situation determines the task, and the action determines the effectiveness. To this end, we must take a long-term perspective, strive to shape the development of a world economy of innovation, growth linkage, and integration of interests, and firmly maintain and develop an open world economy. -Development and innovation are the requirements for sustainable growth of the world economy. Growth that relies solely on stimulus policies and direct government intervention in the economy on a large scale only treats the symptoms, not the root causes, and growth that is based on massive resource consumption and environmental pollution is more difficult to sustain. It is necessary to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth and avoid simply talking about heroes based on GDP growth. All countries should stimulate market vitality and strengthen economic competitiveness through active structural reforms. , ——Growth linkage is a requirement for strong growth of the world economy. A strong growth of the world economy stems from the common growth of all countries. All countries should establish a sense of community of shared destiny, truly recognize the joint effects of ""prosperity and glory, and loss and loss"", and cooperate in competition and win-win in cooperation. Take into account the interests of other countries when pursuing their own interests, and take into account the development of other countries when seeking their own development. Helping different countries to solve outstanding problems with each other is an objective requirement of world economic development. Allow each country's development to form a synergistic effect with the growth of other countries, and bring positive rather than negative spillover effects to each other. -Integration of interests is the need for balanced growth of the world economy. Balanced growth is not a zero-sum game of shifting growth, but growth in the sharing of well-being of all countries. All countries should give full play to their comparative advantages, jointly optimize the allocation of global economic resources, improve the global industrial layout, build a global value chain with shared benefits, cultivate global markets for all parties, and achieve mutually beneficial and win-win development. To shape such a world economy requires the members of the G20 to build a closer economic partnership and shoulder their due responsibilities. , First, adopt responsible macroeconomic policies. The major economies must first do their own thing well, and ensure that their economy is not in trouble. This is our minimum responsibility. We must improve the macroeconomic policy coordination mechanism and strengthen mutual communication and coordination. , Macro and micro economic policies and social policies are a whole. Countries should use social policies to support economic policies to create conditions for the implementation of macro and micro economic policies. The G20 Finance Ministers and Employment Ministers’ meeting decided to strengthen the coordination of economic and employment policies. This is the right way, and it must be firm. In this regard, China’s economic policies are both responsible for the Chinese economy and the world economy. The fundamentals of China’s economy are sound, with GDP growing by 7.6% in the first half of this year. China also faces problems such as local government debt and overcapacity in some industries. These problems are within the controllable range, and we are taking measures to solve them. , We recognize that in order to fundamentally solve the long-term economic development problem, we must resolutely promote structural reforms, and rather slow down the growth rate. Any career needs to be balanced and far-sighted, and the development of killing chickens for eggs, exhausting and fishing will not last long. , The Chinese economy is highly integrated with the world economy. A China with a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality, and more sustainable growth prospects will have long-term benefits for world economic development. China has the conditions and ability to achieve sustained and healthy economic development, create a broader market and development space for all countries, and bring more positive spillover effects to the world economy. Second, jointly safeguard and develop an open world economy. ""One flower alone is not spring, a hundred flowers bloom together in the spring."" The economies of all countries go hand in hand with one another, but withdraw from each other. We must follow the trend of the times, oppose all forms of protectionism, and make overall use of both domestic and international markets and resources. We need to maintain a free, open, and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, not to engage in exclusive trade standards, rules, and systems, and to avoid fragmentation of the global market and trading system. It is necessary to discuss and improve global investment rules, guide the rational flow of global development capital, and allocate development resources more effectively. Third, improve global economic governance and make it more fair and just. The G20 is an important platform for developed and developing countries to conduct full consultations on international economic affairs. We want to build the G20 into a stable world economyThe G-Group is an important platform for developed and developing countries to conduct full consultations on international economic affairs. We must build the G20 into an important force to stabilize the world economy, build an international financial safety net, and improve global economic governance. We must continue to reform international financial institutions, and all relevant countries should further implement the IMF quota and governance reform plan. It is necessary to formulate a new share formula that reflects the weight of each country’s economic aggregate in the world economy. We must continue to strengthen the supervision of the international financial market so that the financial system can truly rely on, serve, and promote the development of the real economy. It is necessary to build a stable and risk-resistant international monetary system, reform the composition of the SDR currency basket, strengthen the links between international and regional financial cooperation mechanisms, and establish a financial risk firewall. , China supports the strengthening of multilateral anti-avoidance cooperation and is willing to do its part to improve the international tax governance mechanism. , I want to emphasize that in order to promote the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and society, China will unswervingly advance reform. We are conducting overall research on comprehensively deepening reforms in order to coordinate and advance system reforms in the fields of economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and further liberate and develop social productive forces, and liberate and increase the creative energy of the entire society. China will strengthen the construction of the market system, promote system reforms in the fields of macroeconomic regulation, finance, taxation, finance, investment, and administrative management, and give full play to the fundamental role of the market in the allocation of resources. China will strive to deepen market-oriented reforms of interest rates and exchange rates, enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and gradually realize the convertibility of RMB capital items. China will adhere to an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, deepen reforms involving investment and trade systems, improve laws and regulations, create a fair environment for the rule of law for enterprises in China, and resolve trade disputes with relevant countries through consultations. , Colleagues! As long as we work together to build a closer partnership, the G20 will go more stable, better, and further away, and people of all countries will have more confidence in the world economy and more confidence in their future lives. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, St. Petersburg, September 5th), ""People's Daily"" (September 06, 2013, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: jointly safeguard and develop an open world economy,2141,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-09-06,"[, 尊敬的普京总统，, 各位同事：, 很高兴在美丽的圣彼得堡同大家见面，共同讨论促进世界经济增长和就业之策。首先，我谨对普京总统和俄罗斯政府为本次峰会所作的积极努力和周到安排，表示衷心的感谢！, 当前，世界经济逐步走出低谷，形势继续朝好的方向发展。同时，国际金融危机负面影响依然存在，一些国家经济尚未摆脱衰退，全球经济复苏依然有很长的路要走。, 形势决定任务，行动决定成效。为此，我们要放眼长远，努力塑造各国发展创新、增长联动、利益融合的世界经济，坚定维护和发展开放型世界经济。, ——发展创新，是世界经济可持续增长的要求。单纯依靠刺激政策和政府对经济大规模直接干预的增长，只治标、不治本，而建立在大量资源消耗、环境污染基础上的增长则更难以持久。要提高经济增长质量和效益，避免单纯以国内生产总值增长率论英雄。各国要通过积极的结构改革激发市场活力，增强经济竞争力。, ——增长联动，是世界经济强劲增长的要求。一个强劲增长的世界经济来源于各国共同增长。各国要树立命运共同体意识，真正认清“一荣俱荣、一损俱损”的连带效应，在竞争中合作，在合作中共赢。在追求本国利益时兼顾别国利益，在寻求自身发展时兼顾别国发展。相互帮助不同国家解决面临的突出问题是世界经济发展的客观要求。让每个国家发展都能同其他国家增长形成联动效应，相互带来正面而非负面的外溢效应。, ——利益融合，是世界经济平衡增长的需要。平衡增长不是转移增长的零和游戏，而是各国福祉共享的增长。各国要充分发挥比较优势，共同优化全球经济资源配置，完善全球产业布局，建设利益共享的全球价值链，培育普惠各方的全球大市场，实现互利共赢的发展。, 塑造这样的世界经济，需要二十国集团各成员建设更加紧密的经济伙伴关系，肩负起应有的责任。, 第一，采取负责任的宏观经济政策。各主要经济体要首先办好自己的事，确保自己的经济不出大的乱子。这是我们最起码的责任。我们要完善宏观经济政策协调机制，加强相互沟通和协调。, 宏观微观经济政策和社会政策是一个整体，各国要用社会政策托底经济政策，为宏观微观经济政策执行创造条件。二十国集团财长和就业部长会议决定加强经济政策和就业政策的协调，是个正确的路子，要坚定不移走下去。, 在这方面，中国采取的经济政策既对中国经济负责，也对世界经济负责。中国经济基本面良好，今年上半年国内生产总值增长７．６％。中国也面临着地方政府债务、部分行业产能过剩等问题。这些问题处于可控范围之内，我们正在采取措施解决。, 我们认识到，为了从根本上解决经济的长远发展问题，必须坚定推动结构改革，宁可将增长速度降下来一些。任何一项事业，都需要远近兼顾、深谋远虑，杀鸡取卵、竭泽而渔式的发展是不会长久的。, 中国经济同世界经济高度融合。一个经济运行更稳定、增长质量更高、增长前景更可持续的中国，对世界经济发展是长期利好的。中国有条件有能力实现经济持续健康发展，为各国创造更广阔的市场和发展空间，为世界经济带来更多正面外溢效应。, 第二，共同维护和发展开放型世界经济。“一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。”各国经济，相通则共进，相闭则各退。我们必须顺应时代潮流，反对各种形式的保护主义，统筹利用国际国内两个市场、两种资源。, 我们要维护自由、开放、非歧视的多边贸易体制，不搞排他性贸易标准、规则、体系，避免造成全球市场分割和贸易体系分化。要探讨完善全球投资规则，引导全球发展资本合理流动，更加有效地配置发展资源。, 第三，完善全球经济治理，使之更加公平公正。二十国集团是发达国家和发展中国家就国际经济事务进行充分协商的重要平台。我们要把二十国集团建设成稳定世界经济、构建国际金融安全网、改善全球经济治理的重要力量。, 我们要继续改革国际金融机构，各有关国家要进一步抓紧落实好国际货币基金组织份额和治理改革方案。要制定反映各国经济总量在世界经济中权重的新份额公式。要继续加强国际金融市场监管，使金融体系真正依靠、服务、促进实体经济发展。要建设稳定、抗风险的国际货币体系，改革特别提款权货币篮子组成，加强国际和区域金融合作机制的联系，建立金融风险防火墙。, 中国支持加强多边反避税合作，愿为健全国际税收治理机制尽一份力。, 我想强调，为推动中国经济社会持续健康发展，中国将坚定不移推进改革。我们正在就全面深化改革进行总体研究，以统筹推进经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明领域体制改革，进一步解放和发展社会生产力、解放和增加全社会创造活力。中国将加强市场体系建设，推进宏观调控、财税、金融、投资、行政管理等领域体制改革，更加充分地发挥市场在资源配置中的基础性作用。中国将努力深化利率和汇率市场化改革，增强人民币汇率弹性，逐步实现人民币资本项目可兑换。中国将坚持互利共赢的开放战略，深化涉及投资、贸易体制改革，完善法律法规，为各国在华企业创造公平经营的法治环境，通过协商解决同相关国家的贸易争端。, 各位同事！, 只要我们携手努力，建设更紧密伙伴关系，二十国集团就会走得更稳、更好、更远，各国人民就会对世界经济更有信心、对未来生活更有信心。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社圣彼得堡９月５日电）  , 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年09月06日 02 版）, ]",习近平：共同维护和发展开放型世界经济,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/22826347
4,103,"[, jointly writing a new chapter in the friendship between the Chinese and African peoples-a speech at the Parliament of the Republic of Congo, (March 29, 2013, Brazzaville), President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, and respected President Sassou, , Dear Speaker Itu and Speaker Kumba, Members, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Hello everyone! I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet with Members of Parliament and friends in Brazzaville. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends present, and through you, to the warm and friendly Congolese people! For a long time, all of you here have been actively committed to the cause of Sino-Vango friendship, promoting exchanges and cooperation between China and Vang from different aspects, and have made important contributions to the development of Sino-Vango relations. Here, I would like to express your high respect and heartfelt thanks to you! For half a century since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ganga, through the careful cultivation and hard work of both sides, the tree of friendship between China and Ganga has grown vigorously. The comprehensive cooperative partnership of solidarity and mutual assistance between China and Ganga has become a model for South-South cooperation, and promoting friendly cooperation between China and Ganga has become a strong consensus between the governments and peoples of the two countries. Although China and Gang are far apart and have different national conditions, the relationship between the two countries has always maintained a strong vitality. The reason for this is that our two countries have established strong political mutual trust on the basis of the common concept. Our two countries aim to achieve common development. Various forms of mutually beneficial cooperation have been carried out, and the peoples of our two countries have forged a profound brotherhood in the midst of adversity and sincere mutual assistance. In April 2010, after the strong earthquake in Yushu, Qinghai, China, the Congolese government generously donated a primary school to the disaster-stricken area. President Sassou personally named it ""Sino-Gangan Friendship Primary School"". Now, the children in the disaster area have a spacious new school building, they can read and study quietly, run and laugh on the sports ground. All the students of the school said emotionally in the letter of appreciation to President Sassou: ""Birds are more free because of the vastness of the sky, horses are more robust because of the broadness of the grassland, and flowers are more so because of the sunshine and dew. Gorgeous, our life is better because of the help of the Congolese government and people."" On behalf of these children, I express my heartfelt thanks to the Congolese government and people! , Ladies and gentlemen! During this visit to Africa, I had friendly meetings with leaders of many African countries and extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in Africa. I have two highlights. First, Africa is a continent full of vitality and hope. During the visit, I deeply felt the earnest yearning and passionate pursuit of a better life for the African people, as well as the firm conviction and determination of the leaders of African countries to lead the people to realize national rejuvenation. This is the most important driving force for Africa's development. We are happy to see that in recent years, the situation in Africa has generally maintained peace and stability, and the economy has continued to grow rapidly. Despite some turbulence in some parts of Africa, I firmly believe that these difficulties and twists and turns cannot stop Africa’s firm pace towards peace, development and progress. At this moment, I think of the verse of an African poet: ""Go forward, Africa, let us hear the rhythm of victory in your singing!"" The second point is that China-Africa cooperation is promising and has a bright future. Since the middle of the last century, the Chinese people and the African people have always sympathized with and supported each other, whether in the struggle for national independence and people's liberation, or in exploring a development path suited to their own national conditions. In the new era, both of us faced the same historical mission again on the road of seeking national development and people's happiness, and achieved fruitful cooperation results. Looking ahead, China's development will bring unprecedented opportunities to Africa, and Africa's development will also bring unprecedented opportunities to China's development. Both of us should go hand in hand and continue to take the path of mutually beneficial cooperation and common development. We are willing to work with African friends to seize historical opportunities, deepen pragmatic cooperation, advance the cause of China-Africa friendship, and better benefit the people of China and Africa. , Ladies and gentlemen! The new developments and changes in the international situation have brought us not only rare development opportunities but also severe challenges. Peace, no war, development, poverty, cooperation and confrontation are the common aspirations of people of all countries. We advocate that the spirit of equality and mutual trust, tolerance and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation be promoted in international relations, and jointly uphold international fairness and justice. All countries must abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, uphold the equality of all nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, respect the diversity of world civilizations, diversify development paths, promote the democratization of international relations, promote the progress of human civilization, and maintain world peace and stability To promote the common interests of mankind. ,Diversity, diversified development paths, promote the democratization of international relations, promote the progress of human civilization, maintain world peace and stability, and enhance the common interests of mankind. , China will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, and unswervingly commit itself to maintaining world peace and promoting common development. No matter how the international situation changes, China has always been a good friend and partner of Africa all the time. China will unswervingly work with African countries in solidarity and mutual assistance, continue to increase aid to Africa, expand trade and investment in Africa, strengthen pragmatic cooperation with Africa, and work together to meet the challenges posed by world economic risks and difficulties. , China will unswervingly enhance mutual trust with African countries, consolidate the traditional friendly political foundation of China and Africa, support African countries to follow their own development path that suits their own national conditions, and support African countries and regional organizations such as the African Union to safeguard national sovereignty and solve their own problems. The efforts on the mainland issue have played a constructive role in maintaining peace and security in Africa. , China will unswervingly cooperate closely with African countries, strengthen coordination in international affairs, jointly address global challenges such as climate change, food security, poverty reduction, and development, and participate in the formulation of international economic, financial, and trade rules to promote international The political and economic order is developing in a more just and reasonable direction. , Ladies and gentlemen! The traditional friendship between China and Africa is deeply rooted in the people. The profound friendship between the people of China and Africa is an important social foundation for China-Africa relations. Only with the enthusiastic participation of both peoples can China-Africa friendship remain viable forever and the foundation of China-Africa cooperation can be continuously consolidated. Only if the results of China-Africa cooperation continue to benefit both peoples can the development of China-Africa relations receive wider and firmer support and support from both peoples. , People's blind date lies in knowing each other. Culture is an important bridge and bond for people of all countries to enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and cultural exchanges are an important pillar of China-Africa's new strategic partnership. The development of China-Africa relations requires both ""hard"" support for economic and trade cooperation and ""soft"" assistance for cultural exchanges. Humane exchanges will provide rich cultural nutrition for the development of China-Africa relations and inject strong spiritual power! We are glad to see that in recent years, China-Africa non-governmental and cultural exchanges have shown a new situation of rapid development, with increasingly rich content, increasingly diverse forms, and increasingly fruitful results. At the same time, we must also see that there is still much room for expansion of non-governmental and cultural exchanges between China and Africa in terms of the expectations of the people of China and Africa and the potential for the development of China-Africa relations. We should build more platforms for direct contact between the peoples of the two sides and provide more sources of information to enhance mutual understanding, so that China-Africa friendship can take root in the hearts of the peoples of both sides, be integrated into the blood of both peoples, and be passed on from generation to generation. , I heard something touching. One night in December 2012, Brazzaville had a sudden downpour and some houses in the suburbs were flooded. The three disaster-stricken Chinese overseas Chinese had been out of danger, but when they discovered that their neighbors were unaware of the danger, they resolutely risked their lives to swim to the side of the submerged house, struggling to open the roof and rescued 12 Congolese Neighbors, including 5 children. Their charity was praised by the local residents. This case fully illustrates that the development of a new type of China-Africa strategic partnership is rooted in people and exchanges. Let us work together to write a new chapter of friendship between the people of China and Africa with the friendship of the people of China and Africa and the land of China and Africa as paper! , Ladies and gentlemen! , The legislature plays an important role in the social and political life of the country. The exchanges and cooperation between the legislative bodies of the two countries and the direct exchanges between parliamentarians are an important part of the relationship between the two countries and an important channel for enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. It is hoped that the legislatures of the two countries will continue to maintain the momentum of friendly exchanges and sincere cooperation, and that members of parliament will give full play to their own advantages and contribute to the deepening of the friendship between the two peoples. , Ladies and gentlemen! There are times when there is no better meeting. I will leave Brazzaville soon and return to China. The friendly smiles of the Congolese people will often appear in front of my eyes. The sincere words from the heart of the Congolese people will always echo in my ears. , I will always cherish the joy, emotion, and friendship gained from this trip to Africa in the depths of my memory. The brotherhood of the African people towards the Chinese people will inspire us to make unremitting efforts to promote China-Africa friendship! , I believe that China-Africa friendship will flow endlessly and move forward like the Yangtze River and the Congo River! , thank you all. , (People's Daily Brazzaville, March 29th),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the Parliament of the Republic of Congo (full text),2932,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-03-30,"[, 共同谱写中非人民友谊新篇章——在刚果共和国议会的演讲, （二〇一三年三月二十九日，布拉柴维尔）, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 尊敬的萨苏总统，, 尊敬的伊图议长和孔巴议长，, 各位议员，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　大家好！有机会同各位议员和朋友们相聚在布拉柴维尔，我感到十分高兴。首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位朋友，并通过你们，向热情友好的刚果人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！, 　　长期以来，在座各位积极致力于中刚友好事业，从不同方面推动中刚交流合作，为发展中刚关系作出了重要贡献。在这里，我向你们表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢！, 　　中刚建交半个世纪以来，经过双方精心培育和辛勤浇灌，中刚友谊之树茁壮成长，到今天已是根深叶茂、硕果累累。中刚团结互助的全面合作伙伴关系成为南南合作典范，推进中刚友好合作成为两国政府和人民的强烈共识。, 　　中刚虽然相距遥远、国情不同，但两国关系始终保持着旺盛生命力，其中的原因，就是我们两国在共同理念的基础上建立了牢固的政治互信，我们两国以实现共同发展为目标开展了形式多样的互利合作，我们两国人民在患难与共和真诚互助中结下了深厚的兄弟情谊。, 　　２０１０年４月，中国青海玉树发生强烈地震后，刚果政府慷慨解囊，向灾区捐建了一所小学，萨苏总统亲自将其命名为“中刚友谊小学”。现在，灾区的孩子们有了宽敞的新校舍，他们可以安静读书学习，在运动场上奔跑欢笑。该校全体学生在写给萨苏总统的感谢信中动情地说：“鸟儿因为有了天空的广阔而更加自由，骏马因为有了草原的宽广而更加健壮，鲜花因为有了阳光雨露而更加艳丽，我们的生活因为有了刚果政府和人民的帮助而更加美好。”我代表这些孩子们，向刚果政府和人民，表示衷心的感谢！, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　这次访问非洲期间，我同许多非洲国家领导人进行了友好会面，并同非洲各界人士广泛接触。我有两点突出感受。, 　　第一点，非洲是充满活力和希望的大陆。访问中，我深切感受到了非洲人民对美好生活的热切向往和热烈追求，深切感受到了非洲国家领导人带领人民实现国家振兴的坚定信念和坚强决心。这是非洲发展最重要的原动力。我们高兴地看到，近年来，非洲局势总体保持和平稳定，经济持续快速增长。, 　　尽管非洲局部地区出现了一些动荡，但我坚信，这些困难和曲折阻挡不住非洲迈向和平、发展、进步的坚定步伐。此时此刻，我想起一位非洲诗人的诗句：“向前走，非洲，让我们听到你歌声中胜利的节奏！”, 　　第二点，中非合作大有可为、前景光明。上世纪中叶以来，无论是在争取民族独立、人民解放的斗争中，还是在探索适合本国国情的发展道路上，中国人民和非洲人民始终相互同情、相互支持。进入新时期，我们双方在谋求国家发展、人民幸福的道路上，再次面临相同的历史使命，取得了丰硕的合作成果。, 　　展望未来，中国发展将给非洲带来前所未有的机遇，非洲发展也将为中国发展带来前所未有的机遇。我们双方应该携手同行，继续坚定走互利合作、共同发展的道路。我们愿同非洲朋友一起，抓住历史机遇，深化务实合作，把中非友好事业推向前进，更好造福中非人民。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　国际形势的新发展新变化，既给我们带来了难得的发展机遇，也给我们带来了严峻挑战。要和平不要战争，要发展不要贫穷，要合作不要对抗，是各国人民共同愿望。, 　　我们主张，在国际关系中弘扬平等互信、包容互鉴、合作共赢的精神，共同维护国际公平正义。各国都要遵循联合国宪章宗旨和原则，坚持国家不分大小、强弱、贫富一律平等，尊重世界文明多样性、发展道路多样化，推动国际关系民主化，推动人类文明进步，维护世界和平稳定，增进人类共同利益。, 　　中国将继续高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，坚定不移致力于维护世界和平、促进共同发展。不论国际形势如何变化，中国始终是非洲全天候的好朋友、好伙伴。, 　　中国将坚定不移同非洲国家团结互助，在力所能及范围内继续增加对非援助、扩大对非贸易和投资、加强对非务实合作，携手应对世界经济风险和困难带来的挑战。, 　　中国将坚定不移同非洲国家增进互信，巩固中非传统友好政治基础，支持非洲国家走自己选择的适合本国国情的发展道路，支持非洲国家和非洲联盟等地区组织维护国家主权、自主解决本大陆问题的努力，为维护非洲和平与安全发挥建设性作用。, 　　中国将坚定不移同非洲国家紧密配合，加强在国际事务中的协调，共同应对气候变化、粮食安全、减贫、发展等全球性挑战，一道参与国际经济、金融、贸易规则制定，推动国际政治经济秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　中非传统友好深深扎根于人民。中非人民深厚友谊是中非关系的重要社会基础。只有双方人民热情参与，中非友谊才能永葆生机活力，中非合作基础才能不断巩固。只有让中非合作成果不断惠及双方人民，中非关系发展才能得到双方人民更广泛更坚定的支持和拥护。, 　　民相亲在于心相知。文化是各国人民增进相互了解和友谊的重要桥梁和纽带，人文交流是中非新型战略伙伴关系的重要支柱。中非关系发展既需要经贸合作的“硬”支撑，也离不开人文交流的“软”助力。人文交流将为中非关系发展提供丰富的文化营养，注入强大的精神动力！, 　　我们高兴地看到，近年来，中非民间交往和人文交流呈现快速发展的新局面，内容日益丰富，形式日益多样，成果日益丰硕。, 　　同时，我们也要看到，相对中非人民的期待和中非关系发展的潜力而言，中非民间和人文交流还有很大拓展空间。, 　　我们应该为双方人民直接接触搭建更多平台、为增进相互了解提供更多信息来源，这样才能让中非友好扎根双方人民心田、溶进双方人民血液，世代传承，发扬光大。, 　　我听说了一件感人的事情。２０１２年１２月的一天夜里，布拉柴维尔突降特大暴雨，郊区一些房屋被淹。３位受灾的中国华侨本已脱离险境，但当他们发现邻居对险情还毫无察觉时，又毅然冒着生命危险游到快被淹没的房屋边，奋力扒开屋顶，救出了１２名刚果邻居，其中包括５名儿童。他们的义举得到当地居民交口称赞。, 　　这个事例充分说明，发展中非新型战略伙伴关系根在人民、源在交流。让我们携手努力，以中非人民情谊为笔，以中非大地为纸，谱写出中非人民友谊新篇章！, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　立法机构在国家社会政治生活中起着重要作用。两国立法机构交流合作和议员直接交往是两国关系的重要组成部分，也是增进两国人民相互了解和友谊的重要渠道。希望两国立法机构继续保持友好交往和真诚合作的势头，希望各位议员充分发挥自身优势，为加深两国人民友谊添砖加瓦。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　再美好的相聚也有分别之时。我很快就要离开布拉柴维尔返回中国了，刚果人民充满友爱的笑容会常常在我眼前浮现，刚果人民发自心底的真诚话语会时时在我耳畔回响。, 　　我会将这次非洲之行收获的愉快、感动、友情永远珍藏在记忆深处，非洲人民对中国人民的兄弟情谊，将激励我们为推进中非友好事业而不懈努力！, 　　我相信，中非友谊将像长江和刚果河一样长流不息、奔腾向前！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（人民网布拉柴维尔３月２９日电）  , ]",习近平在刚果共和国议会的演讲（全文）,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/20971990

I deeply feel the hospitality of the South African people and their active support for BRICS cooperation. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Zuma and the South African government for their thoughtful arrangements for this meeting! , There is an old saying in China that people who are like-minded don't take mountains and seas as far as possible. We come from five countries on the four continents of the world. We have come together to build partnerships and achieve the grand goal of common development. We have come together to promote the democratization of international relations and the noble cause of human peace and development. Seeking peace, seeking development, promoting cooperation, and achieving a win-win situation are our common aspirations and responsibilities. , We must firmly maintain international fairness and justice and safeguard world peace and stability. The world today is not peaceful, and various global threats and challenges are emerging. The BRICS countries love peace and cherish peace. It is our common wish to achieve lasting peace in the world, to allow every country in the world to have a peaceful and stable social environment, and to allow people in every country to live and work in peace and contentment. No matter how the international situation changes, we must always adhere to peaceful development, win-win cooperation, peace without war, cooperation without confrontation, and the legitimate concerns of other countries in the pursuit of our own interests. No matter how the international pattern changes, we must always adhere to equality, democracy, inclusion, respect for the right of each country to independently choose its social system and development path, respect for the diversity of civilizations, and ensure that the country is big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor. For equal members of a country, the affairs of a country are decided by its own people, and international affairs are discussed by each country. No matter how the global governance system changes, we must actively participate, play a constructive role, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and provide institutional guarantee for world peace and stability. , We must vigorously promote the building of a global partnership for development and promote common prosperity for all countries. One tree is not a forest. In the era of deepening economic globalization, the BRICS countries cannot develop independently. They must promote the common development of all countries while seeking their own development. We must strive to develop the economy, improve people's livelihood, do our own thing well, and add more growth points to the world economy. We want to push countries to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, reform the international monetary and financial system, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and promote stronger global economic development. , We must jointly participate in the formulation of the international development agenda, make full use of human accumulated productivity and material resources, complete the UN Millennium Development Goals, narrow the North-South development gap, and promote a more balanced global development. The ""Partnership dedicated to development, integration and industrialization"" proposed by the theme of today's meeting is not only the development goal of the BRICS countries, but also an important direction for cooperation between the BRICS countries and African countries. , We will use the partnership to closely link the BRICS countries, and make great efforts to promote cooperation in the fields of economy and trade, finance, infrastructure construction, personnel exchanges, etc., towards a large integrated market, multi-level circulation, land, sea and air connectivity, and cultural culture. The goal of communication goes forward. We must jointly support Africa’s efforts in seeking strong growth, accelerating integration, and achieving industrialization, and promote the African economy as a new bright spot in the world economy. , We must deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and seek mutual benefit and win-win. The three billion people in the BRICS countries still have a long way to go before they can live a good life and fully realize their longing for a better life. This road is mainly dependent on the self-reliance of various countries, and it also requires the BRICS countries to strengthen cooperation. We must continue to enhance mutual political trust and friendship among the five countries, strengthen the exchange of governance experience, and jointly promote the process of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, grasp the laws of development, innovate development concepts, and solve development problems. We must continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation within the framework of the United Nations, the G20, and international economic and financial institutions to safeguard common interests. , We must translate the political consensus of all countries into concrete actions, actively promote the BRICS development banks, foreign exchange reserves and other projects, accelerate pragmatic cooperation in various fields, consolidate the economic and social foundation of cooperation, and demonstrate the BRICS's internal development and external promotion Positive image of cooperation. The BRICS countries have just been established for five years and are still in the initial development stage. We must do our job well, develop the BRICS cooperation partnership, and build the BRICS cooperation mechanism. As long as we are confident in our own development path and in the BRICS cooperation, we are not afraid of any risks or confused by any interference, and our cause will be able to flourish. , Colleagues! , Everyone is very concerned about China's future development. face to the future,Bewildered by any interference, our cause will certainly flourish. , Colleagues! , Everyone is very concerned about China's future development. Facing the future, China will move toward two ambitious goals in succession: First, by 2020, the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will double that of 2010, and a well-off society that will benefit more than one billion people will be fully built. The second is to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modernized country by the founding of New China in 10049. In order to achieve these two goals, we will continue to make development our top priority, economic construction as our central task, and continue to promote national economic and social development. We will adhere to people-oriented, comprehensively promote economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction, promote the coordination of all aspects and links of modernization construction, and build a beautiful China. This development is an open development. We will adhere to the basic national policy of opening to the outside world, adhere to the opening strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, and continuously improve the level of an open economy. This development is the development of cooperation. We will adhere to the concept of common development, carry out economic and technological cooperation with countries of the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and promote our own development and the common development of all countries through cooperation.

6,128,"[, Dear President Nazarbayev, Dear Mr. President, Teachers and Classmates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Hello everyone! This time, at the invitation of President Nazarbayev, I came to Kazakhstan, a great neighbor, for a state visit. I am very happy to have the opportunity to come to Nazarbayev University and meet everyone. , First of all, I convey the sincere greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the friendly people of Kazakhstan, to the teachers and classmates of Nazarbayev University, and to all the friends here today. , The Kazakh nation has a proverb: ""The history of a land is the history of the people above her."" Since the independence of Kazakhstan, under the leadership of President Nazarbayev, politics has been stable for a long time, the economy has developed rapidly, people's livelihood has improved significantly, and international influence has increased significantly. , The city of Astana, where we are located, has developed into a beautiful modern city in just ten years, which is a beautiful poem written by the people of Kazakhstan on this magical land. Here, I saw the diligent and intelligent struggle of the people of Kazakhstan and the bright future of the people of Kazakhstan. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! More than 2,100 years ago, Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty of China shouldered the mission of peace and friendship. He twice sent Central Asia to open the door of friendly exchanges between China and Central Asian countries, and opened a silk road that traverses East and West and connects Europe and Asia. , My hometown, Shaanxi, is at the beginning of the ancient Silk Road. Standing here, looking back at history, I seemed to hear the camel bells echoing in the mountains, and saw the lonely smoke of the desert flying. All this makes me feel very kind. , Kazakhstan, this land, where the ancient Silk Road passed, has made important contributions to the communication of Eastern and Western civilizations and the promotion of exchanges and cooperation between different peoples and different cultures. Envoys, caravans, tourists, scholars, and craftsmen from the East and the West flowed continuously. Countries along the way communicated with each other, learned from each other, and jointly promoted the progress of human civilization. , There is a Xian Xinghai Avenue in the ancient city of Almaty on the ancient Silk Road. People tell such a story. When the Great Patriotic War broke out in 1941, the famous Chinese musician Xian Xinghai turned to Almaty. On the occasion of unaccompanied, poor and sick, Kazakh musician Bikadamov accepted him and provided him with a warm home. , In Almaty, Xian Xinghai composed famous musical works such as ""National Liberation"", ""Sacred War"" and ""Manjiang Red"", and wrote a symphonic poem ""Aman Gaird"" based on the deeds of Kazakh national hero Aman Gaird , Inspiring people to fight against the fascists, is widely welcomed by the local people. For thousands of years, on this ancient Silk Road, people of all countries have written a friendly chapter that has been passed down through the ages. The history of more than two thousand years of exchange proves that as long as we adhere to unity and mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit, tolerance and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation, countries of different races, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds can all share peace and develop together. This is a valuable revelation left to us by the ancient Silk Road. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! For more than 20 years, with the rapid development of China’s relations with Eurasian countries, the ancient Silk Road has increasingly radiated new vitality, and in a new form, it has continuously pushed mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Eurasian countries to a new historical height. , Distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors. China and Central Asian countries are friendly neighbors connected by mountains and rivers. China attaches great importance to the development of friendly and cooperative relations with countries in Central Asia and regards it as a diplomatic priority. At present, China's relations with Central Asian countries are facing rare opportunities. We hope to work with Central Asian countries to continuously increase mutual trust, consolidate friendship, strengthen cooperation, promote common development and prosperity, and work for the well-being of people of all countries. , ——We must persist in friendship for generations and be a good neighbor in harmony. China adheres to the path of peaceful development and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace. We respect the development path and the internal and external policies independently chosen by people of all countries, and will never interfere in the internal affairs of Central Asian countries. China does not seek the dominance of regional affairs and does not operate its sphere of influence. We are willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Russia and Central Asian countries and make unremitting efforts to build a harmonious region. , ——We must support each other firmly and be good friends with sincerity and mutual trust. Resolute mutual support on major core interests issues including national sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability is the essence and important content of China’s strategic partnership with Central Asian countries. We are willing to strengthen mutual trust and deepen cooperation with other countries within the framework of the bilateral and Shanghai Cooperation Organizations, work together to combat the ""three forces"", drug trafficking, and transnational organized crime, and create a good environment for regional economic development and people's well-being. , ——We must vigorously strengthen the business""Three forces"", drug trafficking, and transnational organized crime create a good environment for regional economic development and people's well-being.-We must vigorously strengthen pragmatic cooperation and be good partners for mutual benefit and win-win results. Both China and Central Asian countries are in key development At this stage, we are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. We have all put forward mid- and long-term development goals that are in line with our national conditions. Our strategic goals are the same, that is, to ensure long-term stable economic development and achieve national prosperity, prosperity and national revitalization. Strengthen pragmatic cooperation, transform the advantages of political relations, geographical proximity, and economic complementarity into pragmatic cooperation advantages and sustainable growth advantages, and create a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests. ——We must expand with a broader mind and a broader vision Regional cooperation is a brilliant place for innovation. At present, global economic integration is accelerating and regional cooperation is flourishing. A number of regional cooperation organizations have been established in the Eurasian region. The Eurasian Economic Community and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member countries and observer countries cross Eurasia, South Asia and West Asia, by strengthening the cooperation between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community, we can gain more room for development., Ladies, gentlemen, friends!, In order to make our Eurasian countries' economic ties closer and mutual cooperation deeper 1. The development space is wider, and we can use the innovative cooperation model to jointly build the ""Silk Road Economic Belt."" This is a great cause for the benefit of the people along the way. We can do it from the following aspects first. Line to piece, gradually form regional cooperation., First, strengthen policy communication. Countries can fully communicate on economic development strategies and countermeasures, in accordance with the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, negotiate to formulate plans and measures to promote regional cooperation, in terms of policies and laws ""Give a green light"" for regional economic integration., Second, strengthen road connectivity. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is negotiating a traffic facilitation agreement. Signing and implementing this document as soon as possible will open up a major transportation channel from the Pacific to the Baltic Sea. On this basis, We are willing to actively discuss with all parties to improve the cross-border transportation infrastructure, and gradually form a transportation network connecting East Asia, West Asia, and South Asia to facilitate the economic development and personnel exchanges of various countries., Third, strengthen smooth trade. Silk Road Economic Belt The total population is nearly 3 billion, and the market size and potential are unique. Countries have great potential for cooperation in the field of trade and investment. All parties should discuss and make appropriate arrangements on trade and investment facilitation issues, eliminate trade barriers, reduce trade and investment costs, and increase Regional economic cycle speed and quality to achieve mutual benefit and win-win., Fourth, strengthen currency circulation. China and Russia and other countries have carried out good cooperation in local currency settlement, achieved gratifying results, and accumulated rich experience. This good practice It is necessary to promote it. If countries achieve local currency exchange and settlement under current account and capital account, they can greatly reduce the cost of circulation, enhance their ability to resist financial risks, and improve the international competitiveness of the region’s economy. Fifth, strengthen people-to-people communication. The exchange of countries lies in the mutual friendship between the people. To do a good job in the above-mentioned fields, we must have the support of the people of all countries, and we must strengthen the friendly exchanges between the people and enhance mutual Understanding and traditional friendship lay a solid foundation of public opinion and social foundation for regional cooperation. , Teachers, students! , Youth is the future of the nation. Abai Kunanbayev, a great poet and thinker in Kazakhstan, said: ""The world is like an ocean, the times are like strong winds, the former waves are like elder brothers, the latter waves are brothers, the winds are the waves, the waves are the waves, and so are the ancients and the present."" The energetic spirit of the students, I couldn't help thinking of my college age, it was an unforgettable youth memory. The people of Kazakhstan often say: ""With knowledge, the world is bright; without knowledge, there is chaos in front of us."" Knowledge is power. Youth is a golden period for learning knowledge, cultivating sentiments, and growth skills. I believe that the students who come out from here will surely become the pillars of the national revitalization of Kazakhstan. To promote youth exchange within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China will provide 30,000 government scholarships to Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states in the next 10 years and invite 10,000 Confucius Institute teachers and students to study in China. I hope you will use the above scholarships to study and exchange in China. Here, I invite 200 teachers and students from your school to go to China to participate in the summer camp activities next year. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Youth is a vital force for the friendship of the people. Young people have similar tastes and emotions, and the most talkable and the easiest way to form innocent friendships. Here, I think of two touching stories about the exchanges between the people of China and Kazakhstan. The first is that in the late 1940s, a Chinese boy working in Xinjiang met the beautiful girl Valianna who worked in a local hospital. The two really loved each other and got married and had children. Later, due to some objective reasons, Valentina returned to China when their son was only 6 years old. This oneValentina, the two really love each other and get married and have children. Later, due to some objective reasons, Valentina returned to China when their son was only 6 years old. As the child grew up, he continued to search for his mother and tried various ways, and there was no news. In 2009, his son finally found his mother Valentina, who lived in Almaty. This year, his son was 61 years old and Valentina was 80 years old. Later, the son came to visit his mother in Almaty, and also took the mother to China for tourism. The happiness of being late for half a century is a strong testimony to the friendship between the Chinese and Kazakh people. The second is that the RH-negative blood type is a very rare blood type in China and is called ""panda blood"". It is difficult for patients with this blood type to find a blood source. Ruslan, a Kazakh foreign student, is of this blood type. While studying at Hainan University, Ruslan has participated in unpaid blood donation since 2009, twice a year, and has contributed to the relief of some Chinese patients. When Chinese friends praised Ruslan, Ruslan said: ""I feel that I should help others, and donate blood is what I should do."" These two touching stories are just two fragments of the epic friendship between the people of China and Kazakhstan. However, it fully shows that the people of our two countries are close to each other and close to each other. , I believe that the youth of China and Kazakhstan, including the students here, will surely become the messengers of Sino-Kazakh friendship and contribute youth and strength to the development of China-Kazakhstan comprehensive strategic partnership. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China and Kazakhstan are friendly neighbors who depend on each other. A common border of more than 1,700 kilometers, a history of more than 2,000 years of exchanges, and extensive common interests have brought us closer together, and have also opened up broad prospects for the development of bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation. Let us join hands to promote traditional friendship and create a better future! , thank you all. , (Chinese Communist Party News Network, Beijing, September 7th), ""People's Daily"" (September 08, 2013 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at Nazarbayev University,3579,来源：人民网-中国共产党新闻网          发布时间：2013-09-08,"[, 尊敬的纳扎尔巴耶夫总统，, 尊敬的校长先生，, 各位老师，各位同学，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！这次，我应纳扎尔巴耶夫总统邀请，来到伟大邻邦哈萨克斯坦进行国事访问。有机会来到纳扎尔巴耶夫大学，并同大家见面，感到十分高兴。, 首先，我向友好的哈萨克斯坦人民，向纳扎尔巴耶夫大学的老师们、同学们，向今天在座的各位朋友，转达中国人民的诚挚问候和良好祝愿。, 哈萨克民族有一句谚语：“一片土地的历史，就是在她之上的人民的历史”。哈萨克斯坦独立以来，在纳扎尔巴耶夫总统领导下，政治长期稳定，经济快速发展，民生大幅改善，国际影响力显著提升。, 我们所在的阿斯塔纳市，在短短十几年间发展成为一座美丽现代化城市，就是哈萨克斯坦人民在这片神奇土地上书写的一个优美诗篇。在这里，我看到了哈萨克斯坦人民勤劳智慧的奋斗，也看到了哈萨克斯坦人民充满光明的未来。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, ２１００多年前，中国汉代的张骞肩负和平友好使命，两次出使中亚，开启了中国同中亚各国友好交往的大门，开辟出一条横贯东西、连接欧亚的丝绸之路。, 我的家乡陕西，就位于古丝绸之路的起点。站在这里，回首历史，我仿佛听到了山间回荡的声声驼铃，看到了大漠飘飞的袅袅孤烟。这一切，让我感到十分亲切。, 哈萨克斯坦这片土地，是古丝绸之路经过的地方，曾经为沟通东西方文明，促进不同民族、不同文化相互交流和合作作出过重要贡献。东西方使节、商队、游客、学者、工匠川流不息，沿途各国互通有无、互学互鉴，共同推动了人类文明进步。, 古丝绸之路上的古城阿拉木图有一条冼星海大道，人们传诵着这样一个故事。１９４１年伟大卫国战争爆发，中国著名音乐家冼星海辗转来到阿拉木图。在举目无亲、贫病交加之际，哈萨克音乐家拜卡达莫夫接纳了他，为他提供了一个温暖的家。, 在阿拉木图，冼星海创作了《民族解放》、《神圣之战》、《满江红》等著名音乐作品，并根据哈萨克民族英雄阿曼盖尔德的事迹创作出交响诗《阿曼盖尔德》，激励人们为抗击法西斯而战，受到当地人民广泛欢迎。, 千百年来，在这条古老的丝绸之路上，各国人民共同谱写出千古传诵的友好篇章。两千多年的交往历史证明，只要坚持团结互信、平等互利、包容互鉴、合作共赢，不同种族、不同信仰、不同文化背景的国家完全可以共享和平，共同发展。这是古丝绸之路留给我们的宝贵启示。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, ２０多年来，随着中国同欧亚国家关系快速发展，古老的丝绸之路日益焕发出新的生机活力，以新的形式把中国同欧亚国家的互利合作不断推向新的历史高度。, 远亲不如近邻。中国同中亚国家是山水相连的友好邻邦。中国高度重视发展同中亚各国的友好合作关系，将其视为外交优先方向。, 当前，中国同中亚国家关系发展面临难得机遇。我们希望同中亚国家一道，不断增进互信、巩固友好、加强合作，促进共同发展繁荣，为各国人民谋福祉。, ——我们要坚持世代友好，做和谐和睦的好邻居。中国坚持走和平发展道路，坚定奉行独立自主的和平外交政策。我们尊重各国人民自主选择的发展道路和奉行的内外政策，决不干涉中亚国家内政。中国不谋求地区事务主导权，不经营势力范围。我们愿同俄罗斯和中亚各国加强沟通和协调，共同为建设和谐地区作出不懈努力。, ——我们要坚定相互支持，做真诚互信的好朋友。在涉及国家主权、领土完整、安全稳定等重大核心利益问题上坚定相互支持，是中国同中亚各国战略伙伴关系的实质和重要内容。我们愿同各国在双边和上海合作组织框架内加强互信、深化合作，合力打击“三股势力”、贩毒、跨国有组织犯罪，为地区经济发展和人民安居乐业创造良好环境。, ——我们要大力加强务实合作，做互利共赢的好伙伴。中国和中亚国家都处在关键发展阶段，面对前所未有的机遇和挑战。我们都提出了符合本国国情的中长期发展目标。我们的战略目标是一致的，那就是确保经济长期稳定发展，实现国家繁荣富强和民族振兴。我们要全面加强务实合作，将政治关系优势、地缘毗邻优势、经济互补优势转化为务实合作优势、持续增长优势，打造互利共赢的利益共同体。, ——我们要以更宽的胸襟、更广的视野拓展区域合作，共创新的辉煌。当前，世界经济融合加速发展，区域合作方兴未艾。欧亚地区已经建立起多个区域合作组织。欧亚经济共同体和上海合作组织成员国、观察员国地跨欧亚、南亚、西亚，通过加强上海合作组织同欧亚经济共同体合作，我们可以获得更大发展空间。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 为了使我们欧亚各国经济联系更加紧密、相互合作更加深入、发展空间更加广阔，我们可以用创新的合作模式，共同建设“丝绸之路经济带”。这是一项造福沿途各国人民的大事业。我们可从以下几个方面先做起来，以点带面，从线到片，逐步形成区域大合作。, 第一，加强政策沟通。各国可以就经济发展战略和对策进行充分交流，本着求同存异原则，协商制定推进区域合作的规划和措施，在政策和法律上为区域经济融合“开绿灯”。, 第二，加强道路联通。上海合作组织正在协商交通便利化协定。尽快签署并落实这一文件，将打通从太平洋到波罗的海的运输大通道。在此基础上，我们愿同各方积极探讨完善跨境交通基础设施，逐步形成连接东亚、西亚、南亚的交通运输网络，为各国经济发展和人员往来提供便利。, 第三，加强贸易畅通。丝绸之路经济带总人口近３０亿，市场规模和潜力独一无二。各国在贸易和投资领域合作潜力巨大。各方应该就贸易和投资便利化问题进行探讨并作出适当安排，消除贸易壁垒，降低贸易和投资成本，提高区域经济循环速度和质量，实现互利共赢。, 第四，加强货币流通。中国和俄罗斯等国在本币结算方面开展了良好合作，取得了可喜成果，也积累了丰富经验。这一好的做法有必要加以推广。如果各国在经常项下和资本项下实现本币兑换和结算，就可以大大降低流通成本，增强抵御金融风险能力，提高本地区经济国际竞争力。, 第五，加强民心相通。国之交在于民相亲。搞好上述领域合作，必须得到各国人民支持，必须加强人民友好往来，增进相互了解和传统友谊，为开展区域合作奠定坚实民意基础和社会基础。, 各位老师、各位同学！, 青年是民族的未来。哈萨克斯坦伟大诗人、思想家阿拜·库南巴耶夫说过：“世界有如海洋，时代有如劲风，前浪如兄长，后浪是兄弟，风拥后浪推前浪，亘古及今皆如此。”看着同学们朝气蓬勃的精神面貌，我不由想起了我的大学时代，那是一个令人难忘的青春记忆。, 哈萨克斯坦人民常讲：“有知识，世界一片光明；没知识，眼前一片混沌。”知识就是力量。青年时代是学习知识、陶冶情操、增长本领的黄金时期。我相信，从这里走出的莘莘学子，一定能成为哈萨克斯坦民族振兴的栋梁。, 为促进上海合作组织框架内青年交流，中国将在未来１０年向上海合作组织成员国提供３万个政府奖学金名额，邀请１万名孔子学院师生赴华研修。希望你们利用上述奖学金到中国学习交流。, 在此，我邀请贵校２００名师生明年赴华参加夏令营活动。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 青年是人民友谊的生力军。青年人情趣相近、意气相投，最谈得来，最容易结下纯真的友谊。这里，我想起了中哈两国人民交往的两个感人故事。, 第一个是，上世纪４０年代末，一位在新疆工作的中国小伙儿认识了在当地医院工作的美丽姑娘瓦莲金娜，两人真心相爱并结婚生子。后来，由于一些客观原因，瓦莲金娜回国了，当时他们的儿子才６岁。这个孩子长大后，不断寻找自己的母亲，想尽了各种办法，始终没有音讯。２００９年，儿子终于找到了自己的母亲瓦莲金娜，他的母亲就住在阿拉木图。这一年，儿子６１岁，瓦莲金娜８０岁。后来，儿子来到阿拉木图看望母亲，还把母亲接到中国旅游。这迟到了半个世纪的幸福，是中哈人民友好的有力见证。, 第二个是，ＲＨ阴性血型在中国属于十分稀有的血型，被称为“熊猫血”。这种血型的病人很难找到血源。哈萨克斯坦留学生鲁斯兰正是这种血型。在海南大学读书期间，鲁斯兰自２００９年起参加无偿献血，每年两次，为一些中国病人解除病痛作出了贡献。当中国朋友称赞鲁斯兰时，鲁斯兰说：“我觉得应该帮助别人，献血是我应该做的。”, 这两个感人故事，只是中哈两国人民友好交往史诗中的两个片断，但充分说明了我们两国人民是心心相印、亲如手足的。, 我相信，包括在座各位同学在内的中哈两国青年，一定会成为中哈友谊的使者，为中哈全面战略伙伴关系发展贡献青春和力量。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中哈两国是唇齿相依的友好邻邦。１７００多公里的共同边界、两千多年的交往历史、广泛的共同利益，把我们紧密联系在一起，也为发展两国关系和深化互利合作开辟了广阔前景。让我们携起手来，弘扬传统友谊，共创美好未来！, 谢谢大家。, （中国共产党新闻网北京9月7日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年09月08日 03 版）, ]",习近平在纳扎尔巴耶夫大学的演讲,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/22843712

Today, I am very honored to have the opportunity to come to the Mexican Senate to give a speech and exchange views with members. On this occasion, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends and parliamentarians present here and people from all walks of life who have long been committed to Sino-Mexico friendship and to the warm and friendly Mexican people! In April this year, President Peña paid an official visit to China and attended the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Meeting. We reached an important consensus on strengthening China-Mexico relations under the new situation. At that time, President Peña warmly invited me to visit Mexico, and I happily agreed. My idea is that in order to accelerate the development of China-Mexico relations, we must take advantage of the heat and take advantage of the momentum. , In 2009, I visited Mexico. After 4 years, I am very happy and very kind to come to this beautiful and colorful country again. , There is a saying in China called ""Home away from home"", which means that the guests have come to a place, just like returning home. When I came to Mexico, I felt this way. , China and Mexico have a long history of exchanges. On my way to Mexico this time, when I overlooked the vast Pacific Ocean through an airplane porthole, it seemed that the ""ship of China"" loaded with silk and porcelain centuries ago was heading towards the waves of Acapulco; when I stepped on When you see the land in your country, it seems that you have seen the legendary beautiful Chinese girl who is imparting textile and embroidery skills in Puebla. The purpose of my visit to Mexico this time is to deepen friendship, expand cooperation, and jointly plan the blueprint for the development of Sino-Mexico relations with the leaders of your country. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Mexico is a country with a long history of civilization. The pyramids of the Maya, the solar calendar of the Aztecs, have witnessed the glory of ancient civilizations in your country. , Mural of contemporary art master Rivera, and the writings of literary master Pass, embodies the profound feelings of the Mexican people on the real world and human life. Today in Mexico, the economy is developing rapidly, and the overall national strength and international influence are constantly improving. From the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun to the summit of the leaders of the G20 Los Cabos, the world’s eyes have been time and time again on the thriving Mexico. , We congratulate Mexico on its development achievements and sincerely wish Mexico's national construction cause greater achievements! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Looking back at history, the people of both China and Mexico have created a splendid culture and made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization. There is a proverb in Latin America: ""Friends need to be old, good wine needs to be old."" The deep friendship that China and Mexico have accumulated over the years is just like the aged tequila, which lasts for a long time. Since modern times, China and Mexico have supported and supported each other in the struggle for national liberation, defending national sovereignty, and building a modern country. Now, our two countries have entered the fast track of economic and social development, and both have shown promising development prospects. China-Mexico relations are facing unprecedented and important opportunities. , This time, I had a very good meeting with President Peña. Just now, I met with President Annaya and Speaker of the House of Representatives Arroyo. We agree that the development of China-Mexico relations should focus not only on bilateral cooperation, but also on the world. To this end, President Peña and I decided to promote the relationship between the two countries into a comprehensive strategic partnership, so that China-Mexico relations can continue to develop at a higher level, in a wider area, and on a larger stage, pushing the relationship between the two countries into a new one. progression stage. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Working together to create the future is the call of the times to us and the mission entrusted to us by history. Under the guidance of the spirit of the ""Sino-Mexico Joint Statement"", both parties should work together and persevere to jointly promote the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. First, we must adhere to equality and strengthen strategic cooperation. The President of your country, Benito Juárez, once said: ""No matter between people or between countries, respect for the rights of others can bring peace."" Confucius, an ancient Chinese thinker, said: ""Do not do what you want. Faced with a complex and ever-changing international situation, China and Mexico should uphold mutual respect and trust, and continue to understand and understand each other on issues that involve each other’s core interests and major concerns, while exploring the development path that suits their national conditions. stand by. Both sides should maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges and give full play to the leading role of high-level exchanges in the relations between the two countries. The governments, legislatures, political parties and localities of the two countries should strengthen exchanges and strengthen the exchange of experience and mutual learning in governing the country. , The two sides should give full play to the role of the two countries' permanent committees, strategic dialogues, parliamentary dialogue forums and other mechanisms to strengthen dialogue and consultation,Exchange of experience and mutual learning. Both sides should give full play to the role of the two countries' permanent committees, strategic dialogues, parliamentary dialogue forums and other mechanisms, strengthen dialogue and consultation, enhance strategic mutual trust, and safeguard the common interests of the two countries. Second, we must adhere to win-win cooperation and promote common development. Development is the fundamental way to enhance the well-being of the people and promote social progress. It is the most important agenda facing both China and Mexico. Both sides should firmly grasp the theme of common development, regard each other's development as an opportunity for their own development, promote their respective development in cooperation, and promote common development through their respective development. Both China and Mexico have their own characteristics and strengths. The two sides can strengthen communication on their respective development strategies and implement the joint action plan of the two countries. While consolidating cooperation in traditional fields such as mining, agriculture and communications, they can vigorously expand energy, transportation, infrastructure construction, high technology, clean energy, energy conservation and environmental protection, and high-end Cooperation in emerging fields such as equipment manufacturing. Both sides should insist on equal emphasis on trade and investment, by expanding mutual investment, optimizing the trade structure, strengthening industrial docking, making the cooperation cake bigger, enhancing the international competitiveness of the two countries, and creating more job opportunities. , The two sides should build more platforms to promote bilateral economic and trade circles and business circles to strengthen exchanges and deepen friendship, carry out various forms of mutually beneficial cooperation in trade promotion, market expansion, investment and business development, share each other's development opportunities, and promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation Balanced development. , China does not seek a trade surplus, and is willing to always maintain an open posture and actively increase imports of Mexican products, especially high value-added products. China and Mexico should jointly oppose protectionism, insist on resolving economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultation, and create a favorable environment for expanding bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Third, we must persist in communication and coordination and safeguard common interests. The Latin American region and the Asian region are all regions full of vitality and potential for development in today's world. China and Mexico should actively participate in global economic governance and jointly promote the recovery of the world economy and the balanced development of international forces. Under the new situation, China and Mexico have more common demands and shoulder more common responsibilities. The two sides should work together to promote the democratization of international relations, work together to address global challenges such as the international financial crisis, climate change, and sustainable development, and safeguard the common interests of China and Mexico and the vast number of developing countries. Fourthly, we must persist in exchanges and mutual learning and inherit the friendship between China and Mexico. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date. The friendly feelings of the people are an inexhaustible driving force for the sustained development of state-to-state relations. , The famous Mexican writer Pas had translated the thoughts of Chinese philosophers Laozi and Zhuangzi into Spanish more than two thousand years ago. Zhuang Zi said: ""The water is not thick, and the big boat is also weak."" We want to bring the friendship of the people of China and Mexico into a vast sea, and let the big ship of friendly cooperation between China and Mexico continue to ride the wind and the waves. With the continuous development of Sino-Mexico relations, the desire of the two peoples to enhance mutual understanding is stronger than ever. Both of us should continue to expand exchanges in the fields of culture, education, sports, news, film and television, tourism, etc., so as to deepen the friendship between China and Mexico. , I am a football fan. The Chinese football team has been working very hard, but currently only once broke into the World Cup match, led the Chinese team to create this record is also the head coach of the Mexican national football team, Milu. , I heard that a Mexican sports official once asked the leader of the Chinese diving team what it is like to win the gold medal. Two years ago, under the guidance of a Chinese coach, Mexico’s “diving princess” Espinosa and his teammates won all eight gold medals in the diving event of the 2011 Pan American Games. The Mexican friends tasted the gold medal. We wish the Mexican diving team to win more gold medals in the future! Wish China and Mexico cooperate to win more ""gold medals""! The direct exchange of people is the most effective way to deepen friendship between countries. In the next five years, China's outbound tourism is expected to exceed 400 million. The Mexican Sun and Moon Pyramids, Chichen Itza Ancient City, and Acapulco Beach will see more Chinese tourists. , We also expect more Mexican friends to board the Great Wall of China, stop at the Forbidden City in Beijing, watch the Terracotta Warriors and Horses of Xi'an, and experience the rapid development and progress of China while experiencing the ancient Chinese civilization. Youth is the future of the country and the world, as well as the future of China-Mexico friendship. We must strengthen youth exchanges between the two countries, give full play to their role as freshmen, and allow China-Mexico friendship to pass on from generation to generation. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Mexico is an important country in Latin America. The development of China-Mexico relations can play an important role in promoting the development of China-Latin America relations. Here, I would like to comment on the development of China-Latin America relations. , Once again set foot on this continent full of vigor and hope in Latin America, and feel the unique development conditions here, Latin America is ushering in another golden period of development. We believe that the better the development of Latin America, the better for the world and the better for China. , Currently, China-Latin America relations are inAnother golden period of development. We believe that the better the development of Latin America, the better for the world and the better for China. At present, China-Latin America relations are in a period of important opportunities for rapid development. We should ascend the horizon, advance with the times, consolidate traditional friendship, strengthen all-round exchanges, improve the level of cooperation, and promote the realization of new and greater development of the comprehensive cooperative partnership of equality, mutual benefit and common development between China and Latin America. ——Politically, China and Latin America should adhere to sincerity and friendship and continue to understand and support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests and major concerns. ——Economically, China and Latin America should seize the opportunities brought about by the transformation of the economic development mode of both sides, dig deep into the potential for cooperation, innovate cooperation models, deepen the integration of interests, and establish a lasting and stable mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation partnership. ——In the humanities, China and Latin America should strengthen dialogues and cultural exchanges between civilizations, not only ""beautifying each other for its beauty"", but also ""beauty of beauty, beauty and beauty"", becoming a model for harmonious coexistence and mutual promotion of different civilizations. It is hoped that China and Latin America will work together to establish the China-Latin America Cooperation Forum as soon as possible, give full play to their respective advantages, build a larger platform for promoting China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership, and jointly add more positive energy for the stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific. , China has a proverb that is called ""Lu Yao knows horsepower and sees people's hearts over time"". The development process of China-Latin America relations has and will continue to prove that the development of bilateral relations is open development, inclusive development, cooperation development, and win-win development. We firmly believe that a higher level of comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Latin America will definitely promote the common development of both sides and also benefit regional, world and peace, stability and prosperity. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! China has set its future development goals, which is to build a well-off society in an all-round way by 2020, and build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century. In the long historical process, the Chinese people have relied on their hard work, bravery, and wisdom to create a beautiful homeland for the harmonious coexistence of various nationalities and cultivate a long-lasting excellent culture. The Chinese people love life and look forward to better education, more stable work, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, higher levels of medical and health services, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment. The realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the most fundamental dream of the Chinese nation in modern times. The Chinese people are striving to realize their beautiful wishes. , China has an old saying: ""One flower alone is not spring, but a hundred flowers bloom in spring."" The poet Alfonso Reyes of your country once said: ""Only the world can benefit the country."" In the process of development, China will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, adhere to reform and opening up, promote common development, and strive to bring more opportunities to the world. As the world's second largest import market, China will import more than US$10 trillion in products in the next five years, and its foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion. We are confident that China's economy will continue to develop rapidly, which will bring more business opportunities to countries in the world, including Latin America and the Caribbean, and make greater contributions to world economic growth. At the same time, we also soberly realize that China is still the largest developing country in the world, and creating a happy and beautiful life for 1.3 billion people is no easy task. China still faces many difficulties and challenges on the road of development. Realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will require long and arduous efforts. , I firmly believe that through the unremitting efforts of the Chinese people, China's tomorrow will be even better! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! There is a common proverb between China and Mexico that is, ""If you have aspirations, things are done."" The ambitious goals for the future development of our two countries’ relations have been determined, and the key is to put them into action. Let us join hands and take the opportunity of establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries to grasp the direction, forge ahead, and jointly create a better future for China-Mexico relations! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, June 5th), ""People's Daily"" (June 07, 2013, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech in the Mexican Senate: Promoting common development and creating a better future,4241,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-06-07,"[, 尊敬的墨西哥国会常设委员会主席安纳亚先生，, 各位议员，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家好！今天，有机会来到墨西哥参议院演讲，同各位议员交流，我感到十分荣幸。, 借此机会，我谨代表中国政府和人民，向在座各位议员朋友和长期致力于中墨友好的各界人士，向热情友好的墨西哥人民，致以诚挚问候和良好祝愿！, 今年４月，培尼亚总统对中国进行正式访问并出席博鳌亚洲论坛年会，我们就新形势下加强中墨关系达成重要共识。当时，培尼亚总统热情邀请我访问墨西哥，我愉快地答应了。我的想法是，为了推动中墨关系加快发展，必须趁热打铁、乘势而上。, ２００９年，我曾访问过墨西哥。时隔４年，再次来到这个美丽多彩的国家，我感到十分高兴，也感到十分亲切。, 中国有句话叫“宾至如归”，说的是客人到了一个地方，就像回到家里一样。来到墨西哥，我就有这样的感觉。, 中墨两国有着悠久的交往历史。这次前来墨西哥途中，当我透过飞机舷窗俯瞰浩瀚的太平洋时，仿佛看见几个世纪前那些满载丝绸、瓷器的“中国之船”正向着阿卡普尔科破浪前行；当我踏上贵国的土地时，又仿佛看见那位传说中的乐善好施的美丽“中国姑娘”正在普埃布拉传授纺织、刺绣技艺。, 我这次访问墨西哥，目的是深化友谊、扩大合作，同贵国领导人共同规划中墨关系的发展蓝图。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 墨西哥是个具有悠久文明历史的国家。玛雅人的金字塔，阿兹特克人的太阳历，见证着贵国古代文明的辉煌。, 当代艺术大师里维拉的壁画，文学巨匠帕斯的著作，凝聚着墨西哥人民对现实世界和人类生活的深刻感受。, 今天的墨西哥，经济快速发展，综合国力和国际影响力不断提升。从坎昆联合国气候变化大会，到洛斯卡沃斯二十国集团领导人峰会，世界的目光一次又一次聚焦在欣欣向荣的墨西哥。, 我们对墨西哥的发展成就表示祝贺，衷心祝愿墨西哥国家建设事业取得更大成就！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 回顾历史，中墨两国人民都创造了灿烂的文化，都为人类文明进步作出了不可磨灭的贡献。, 拉美有句谚语：“朋友要老，好酒要陈。”中墨两国经过岁月积淀的深厚友谊，正如陈年的龙舌兰酒，历久弥香。, 近代以来，中墨两国在争取民族解放、捍卫国家主权、建设现代化国家的奋斗中相互声援、彼此支持。, 现在，我们两国都进入了经济社会发展的快车道，都呈现出美好的发展前景，中墨关系正面临前所未有的重要机遇。, 这次来，我同培尼亚总统举行了很好的会谈。刚才，我又会见了安纳亚主席和阿罗约众议长。, 我们一致认为，发展中墨关系既要着眼双边合作，更要面向世界。为此，我和培尼亚总统决定，将两国关系提升为全面战略伙伴关系，使中墨关系能够在更高水平、更宽领域、更大舞台上不断发展，推动两国关系进入新的发展阶段。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 携手合作、共创未来，是时代对我们的召唤，是历史赋予我们的使命。双方应该在《中墨联合声明》精神指引下，齐心协力，锲而不舍，共同推进两国全面战略伙伴关系。, 第一，我们要坚持平等相待、加强战略协作。贵国总统贝尼托·华雷斯曾说过：“无论人与人还是国与国之间，尊重他人权利才能带来和平。”中国古代思想家孔子说过：“己所不欲，勿施于人。”, 面对复杂多变的国际形势，中墨两国应该坚持互尊互信，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切的问题上，在探索符合各自国情发展道路的努力中，继续相互理解、相互支持。, 双方应该保持高层交往势头，充分发挥高层交往对两国关系的引领作用。两国政府、立法机构、政党、地方应该加强往来，加强治国理政经验交流和互鉴。, 双方应该充分发挥两国常设委员会、战略对话、议会对话论坛等机制作用，加强对话磋商，增进战略互信，维护两国共同利益。, 第二，我们要坚持合作共赢、促进共同发展。发展是增进人民福祉、促进社会进步的根本途径，是中墨两国共同面临的最重要议程。双方应该牢牢把握共同发展的主题，将对方发展视为自身发展的机遇，在合作中促进各自发展，又通过各自发展推动共同发展。, 中墨两国经济各具特色、各有所长。双方可以就各自发展战略加强沟通，落实两国共同行动计划，在巩固矿业、农业、通信等传统领域合作的同时，大力拓展能源、交通、基础设施建设、高技术以及清洁能源、节能环保、高端装备制造等新兴领域合作。, 双方应该坚持贸易和投资并重，通过扩大相互投资，优化贸易结构，加强产业对接，做大做好合作蛋糕，提高两国国际竞争力，创造更多就业机会。, 双方应该搭建更多平台，促进两国经贸界、企业界加强交流、深化友谊，在贸易促进、市场拓展、投资兴业等方面开展各种形式的互利合作，分享彼此发展机遇，促进双边经贸合作平衡发展。, 中方不寻求贸易顺差，愿始终保持开放姿态，积极增加进口墨西哥产品，特别是高附加值产品。中墨应该共同反对保护主义，坚持通过对话协商解决经贸摩擦，为扩大双边经贸合作营造有利环境。, 第三，我们要坚持沟通协调、维护共同利益。拉美地区、亚洲地区都是当今世界充满发展活力和潜力的地区。中墨两国应该积极参与全球经济治理，共同推动世界经济复苏增长和国际力量均衡发展。, 新形势下，中墨拥有更多共同诉求，肩负更多共同责任。双方应该共同促进国际关系民主化，携手应对国际金融危机、气候变化、可持续发展等全球性挑战，维护中墨两国和广大发展中国家的共同利益。, 第四，我们要坚持交流互鉴、传承中墨友好。国之交在于民相亲。人民友好感情是推动国与国关系持久发展的不竭动力。, 墨西哥著名作家帕斯曾将两千多年前中国哲人老子、庄子的思想翻译成西班牙文。庄子说过：“水之积也不厚，则其负大舟也无力。”我们要让中墨两国人民友情汇聚成浩瀚的大海，让中墨友好合作的大船不断乘风破浪前进。, 随着中墨关系不断发展，两国人民增进相互了解的愿望比以往任何时候都更加强烈。我们双方应该通过不断扩大文化、教育、体育、新闻、影视、旅游等领域交流，使中墨友好更加深入人心。, 我是一个足球迷。中国足球队一直很努力，但目前只有一次闯进过世界杯比赛，带领中国队创造这次纪录的就是也担任过墨西哥国家足球队主教练的米卢。, 我听说，一位墨西哥体育官员曾问中国跳水队领队，包揽金牌是什么滋味。两年前，在中国教练指导下，墨西哥“跳水公主”埃斯皮诺萨和队友们包揽了２０１１年泛美运动会跳水项目全部８块金牌。墨西哥朋友们尝到了包揽金牌的滋味。我们祝愿墨西哥跳水队今后夺得更多金牌！祝愿中墨两国合作夺得更多“金牌”！, 人民直接交往是加深国与国友谊最有效的方式。未来５年，中国出境旅游有望超过４亿人次，墨西哥的太阳月亮金字塔、奇琴伊察古城、阿卡普尔科海滩，将会出现更多中国游客的身影。, 我们也期待更多墨西哥朋友登上中国长城，驻足北京故宫，观赏西安兵马俑，在感受中国古老文明的同时，体验当今中国日新月异的发展和进步。, 青年是国家的未来、世界的未来，也是中墨友好事业的未来。我们要加强两国青年交往，充分发挥他们的生力军作用，让中墨友好代代相传。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 墨西哥是拉美重要国家，中墨关系发展可以对中拉关系发展起到重要推动作用。, 这里，我想就发展中拉关系谈点意见。, 再次踏上拉丁美洲这片充满生机和希望的大陆，更加感受到这里发展条件得天独厚，拉美正在迎来又一个发展的黄金时期。我们相信，拉美发展得越好，对世界就越好，对中国也越好。, 当前，中拉关系正处于快速发展的重要机遇期。我们应该登高望远、与时俱进，巩固传统友谊，加强全方位交往，提高合作水平，推动中拉平等互利、共同发展的全面合作伙伴关系实现新的更大发展。, ——政治上，中拉要坚持真诚友好，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切的问题上继续相互理解、相互支持。, ——经济上，中拉要抓住双方转变经济发展方式带来的机遇，深挖合作潜力，创新合作模式，深化利益融合，建立持久稳定的互利经贸合作伙伴关系。, ——人文上，中拉要加强文明对话和文化交流，不仅“各美其美”，而且“美人之美，美美与共”，成为不同文明和谐共处、相互促进的典范。, 希望中拉双方共同努力，早日建成中拉合作论坛，综合发挥双方各自优势，为推进中拉全面合作伙伴关系构筑更大平台，共同为亚太稳定繁荣增添更多正能量。, 中国有句谚语，叫做“路遥知马力，日久见人心”。中拉关系的发展历程已经并将继续证明，双方关系发展是开放的发展、包容的发展、合作的发展、共赢的发展。, 我们坚信，一个更高水平的中拉全面合作伙伴关系，必将更有力地促进双方共同发展，也有利于地区和世界的和平、稳定、繁荣。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国制定了未来发展目标，这就是到２０２０年全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。, 在漫长的历史进程中，中国人民依靠自己的勤劳、勇敢、智慧，开创了各民族和睦共处的美好家园，培育了历久弥新的优秀文化。, 中国人民热爱生活，期盼有更好的教育、更稳定的工作、更满意的收入、更可靠的社会保障、更高水平的医疗卫生服务、更舒适的居住条件、更优美的环境。实现中华民族伟大复兴是近代以来中华民族最根本的梦想。中国人民正在为实现自己的美好愿望而奋斗。, 中国有句古话：“一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园。”贵国诗人阿方索·雷耶斯也曾说过：“唯有益天下，方可惠本国。”, 在发展进程中，中国将继续高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，坚持改革开放，促进共同发展，努力给世界带来更多机遇。, 作为世界第二大进口市场，中国今后５年将进口１０万多亿美元产品，对外投资规模将超过５０００亿美元。我们有信心保持中国经济持续较快发展，这将给包括拉美和加勒比在内的世界各国带来更多商机，为世界经济增长作出更大贡献。, 同时，我们也清醒地认识到，中国仍然是世界上最大的发展中国家，创造１３亿人的幸福美好生活绝非易事。中国在发展道路上仍然面临不少困难和挑战。实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，还需要付出长期艰苦的努力。, 我坚信，通过中国人民不懈奋斗，中国的明天一定会更加美好！, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中墨两国有句共同的谚语，叫做“有志者事竟成”。, 我们两国关系未来发展的宏伟目标已经确定，关键是付诸行动。, 让我们携起手来，以两国建立全面战略伙伴关系为契机，把握方向，开拓进取，共同开创中墨关系更加美好的未来！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社墨西哥城６月５日电）  , 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年06月07日 02 版）, ]",习近平在墨西哥参议院的演讲：促进共同发展  共创美好未来,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/21770184
8,130,"[, Dear Heads of State, Heads of Government, Speakers, Heads of International Organizations, Ministers, Members of the Boao Forum for Asia Council, Guests, Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends: 　　Coconut wind warms people, sea and sky high. In this beautiful season, I am very happy to be with you on the beautiful Hainan Island and to attend the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2013. , 　　 First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I sincerely welcome the arrival of friends! Congratulations on the annual meeting! In the past 12 years, the Boao Forum for Asia has increasingly become an important forum with global influence. In Chinese culture, every 12 years is a zodiac cycle. As such, the Boao Forum for Asia is at a new starting point, hoping to take it to a higher level. , 　　 The theme of this annual meeting is ""Renovation, Responsibility, Cooperation: Asia seeks common development"", which is of practical significance. I believe that you can fully express your vision, discuss the development plans of Asia and the world, and contribute wisdom and strength to promote peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the world. , 　　 At present, the international situation continues to undergo profound and complex changes. The countries of the world are getting closer to each other and their interdependence is deepening. Many developing countries and billions of people all over the world are striving to modernize, and the trend of times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is even stronger. At the same time, the world is still very uneven, development problems are still outstanding, the world economy has entered a period of deep adjustment, the overall recovery is difficult and tortuous, there are still many risks in the international financial field, various forms of protectionism are rising, and various countries face many challenges in adjusting their economic structure Difficulties, the global governance mechanism needs to be further improved. There is still a long way to go to achieve the common development of all countries. , 　　 Asia is one of the regions with the most development vitality and potential in the world today. Asian development is closely related to the development of other continents. Asian countries have actively explored development paths suited to their own conditions, and have vigorously promoted world development while achieving their own development. Asia and the rest of the world have overcome difficulties together and cooperated to cope with the international financial crisis and become an important engine for stimulating the recovery and growth of the world economy. In recent years, the contribution rate to the world economic growth has exceeded 50%, which has brought confidence to the world. The regional subregional cooperation between Asia and the rest of the world has shown great vitality and bright prospects. Of course, we are also clearly aware that if Asia is to seek greater development and better promote the common development of this region and the rest of the world, it still faces many difficulties and challenges, and needs to climb slopes and pass obstacles. . , 　　——Asian development needs to take advantage of the trend, transform and upgrade. For Asia, development is still the top priority, and development is still the key to solving the outstanding contradictions and problems facing. There is an urgent need to transform the economic development mode, adjust the economic structure, improve the quality and efficiency of economic development, and continue to improve people’s lives on this basis. Level. , 　　——Asian stability requires joint care and resolution of problems. Asia’s stability is facing new challenges. Hot issues are emerging one after another. Both traditional and non-traditional security threats are manifested. To achieve long-term security in the region, regional countries need to increase mutual trust and work together. , 　　——Asian cooperation needs a hundred feet to go further. There are many mechanisms and initiatives to strengthen cooperation in Asia. There are various ideas and opinions in various fields. Coordinating the interests of various parties and forming a mechanism that can guarantee mutual benefit and win-win results in better understanding, consensus building, enrichment, and deepening cooperation. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! ,   humankind has only one Earth, each nation coexist in one world. Common development is an important foundation for sustainable development and is in the long-term and fundamental interests of people of all countries. We live in the same global village, and we should firmly establish a sense of community of destiny, follow the trend of the times, grasp the right direction, stick to the same boat, and promote the development of Asia and the world to a new level. , 　　 First, be brave in reform and innovation, and provide inexhaustible power for the promotion of common development. For a long time, many countries and regions have formed many good experiences and good practices in maintaining stability and promoting development. We must continue to carry forward these good experiences and practices. At the same time, everything in the world is not changing. ""The bright people change with the times, and the intelligent people control the things."" It is necessary to abandon the outdated old concepts, break through the old framework restricting development, and let all kinds of development vitality burst out. It is necessary to step up efforts to transform the economic development mode, adjust the economic structure, pay more attention to the quality of development, and pay more attention to improving people's livelihood. It is necessary to steadily advance the reform of the international economic and financial system, improve the global governance mechanism, and provide guarantee for the healthy and stable growth of the world economy. Asia has always had the vitality of self-transformation.Reform and improve the global governance mechanism to provide a guarantee for the healthy and stable growth of the world economy. Asia has always had the vitality of self-reform, and it is necessary to be brave in the trend of the times so that Asian change and world development can mutually promote and complement each other. , 　　 Second, work together to maintain peace and provide security for the promotion of common development. Peace is the eternal expectation of the people. Peace is like air and sunlight, benefiting without realizing it, or losing it is hard to survive. no peace, no development. Regardless of the size, strength, weakness, or wealth of the country, the country should be a peacekeeper and promoter. It should not build or dismantle Taiwan, but should complement each other and play together. The international community should advocate the concepts of comprehensive security, common security, and cooperative security, so that our global village can become a stage for common development, rather than a competitive arena, and it should not mess up a region or the world for its own self. The frequent exchanges between countries are inevitable. It is inevitable that bumps and bumps are inevitable. The key is to persist in dialogue and consultation and peaceful negotiations, properly resolve conflicts and differences, and maintain the overall development of mutual relations. , 　　 Third, focus on promoting cooperation to provide an effective way to promote common development. ""One flower alone is not spring, a hundred flowers bloom in the spring."" All countries in the world are closely linked and their interests are intertwined. They must communicate with each other and complement each other's advantages. When pursuing their own interests, they should also take into account the legitimate concerns of other countries, and promote the common development of all countries in the pursuit of their own development. Continue to expand the meeting point of common interests. It is necessary to strengthen South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue, promote the balanced development of developing and developed countries, and lay a solid foundation for the long-term stable development of the world economy. We must actively create more opportunities for cooperation, improve the level of cooperation, make development achievements better benefit people of all countries, and make more contributions to promoting world economic growth. , 　　 Fourth, adhere to openness and inclusiveness and provide a broad space for common development. ""Hundreds of rivers and rivers, tolerance is great."" We should respect the right of each country to independently choose its social system and development path, eliminate doubts and barriers, and transform world diversity and national differences into development vitality and motivation. We must uphold the spirit of openness, actively learn from the development experience of other regions, share development resources, and promote regional cooperation. In the more than 10 years since the beginning of the new century, intra-Asian trade volume has increased from US$800 billion to US$3 trillion, and the trade volume between Asia and the rest of the world has increased from US$1.5 trillion to US$4.8 trillion, which shows Asian cooperation. It is open. Cooperation within the region is not incompatible with cooperation with other regions. Everyone has benefited from cooperation. Asia should welcome countries outside the region to play a constructive role in the stability and development of the region. At the same time, countries outside the region should also respect Asia’s diversity and established cooperation traditions, and form a good trend for Asian development to develop benign interactions and go hand in hand with other regions. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China is an important member of the big family in Asia and the world. China cannot develop without Asia and the world, and prosperity and stability in Asia and the world also need China. , 　　 In November last year, the Communist Party of China held the 18th National Congress, which clarified China's development blueprint for a period to come. Our goal is to double GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents on the basis of 2010 to build a well-off society in an all-round way; to build a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious socialist modern country by the middle of this century and realize China The Chinese dream of a great national rejuvenation. Looking ahead to the future, we are filled with confidence. , 　　 We also recognize that China is still the largest developing country in the world, and China still faces many difficulties and challenges in its development. To make all Chinese people live a better life, we need to make long-term and unremitting efforts. We will adhere to the principle of unshakable reform and opening up, firmly grasp the main line of transforming the mode of economic development, concentrate on doing our business well, and continue to promote socialist modernization. , 　　 ""Let's look forward to good, neighbors look good to neighbors."" China will insist on being good neighbors and partners, consolidating good-neighborly friendship, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation, and striving to make its own development better for neighboring countries. , 　　 We will vigorously promote the development and prosperity of Asia and the world. Since the new century, China's trade volume with neighboring countries has increased from more than 100 billion US dollars to 1.3 trillion US dollars. It has become the largest trading partner, largest export market, and important source of investment for many neighboring countries. The integration of China's interests with Asia and the world has reached an unprecedented breadth and depth. At present and for a period to come, China's economy will continue to maintain a healthy development momentum, domestic demand, especially consumer demand, will continue to expand, and foreign investment will also increase substantially. It is estimated that in the next five years, China will import about 10 trillion US dollars of commodities, and the scale of foreign investment will reach 500 billion US dollars, and the outbound tourism may exceed 400 million people. The more China develops, the more it will bring development opportunities to Asia and the world. , 　　 We will firmly maintain peace and stability in Asia and the world. Chinese people react to warThe more the country develops, the more it will bring development opportunities to Asia and the world. , 　　 We will firmly maintain peace and stability in Asia and the world. The Chinese people have an unforgettable memory of the suffering caused by war and turmoil, and have a tireless pursuit of peace. China will develop itself by striving for a peaceful international environment, and maintain and promote world peace through its own development. China will continue to properly handle differences and frictions with relevant countries, and on the basis of firmly safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, strive to maintain relations with neighboring countries and the overall situation of regional peace and stability. China will continue to play a constructive role on international and regional hotspot issues, persist in persuading peace and promoting talks, and make unremitting efforts to properly handle relevant issues through dialogue and negotiation. , 　　 We will actively promote regional cooperation in Asia and the world.

9,131,"[, Dear President Torkunov, Dear Deputy Prime Minister Gologets,, Teachers and students: Today, I have the opportunity to come to the beautiful Moscow International Relations Institute to meet with teachers and students, Feel very happy. , Moscow Institute of International Relations is a world-renowned institution with a large number of famous teachers and outstanding talents. I would like to extend my warm congratulations to your outstanding achievements in various fields! , Russia is China's friendly neighbor. This visit to Russia is my first visit since becoming the President of China. It is the first stop of this visit. It is also my beautiful and rich country once again after three years. Yesterday, I held fruitful talks with President Putin and jointly attended the opening ceremony of the Russia-China Tourism Year. , Early spring in March means the arrival of a new season of recovery of all things and the arrival of a new moment of sowing. As the saying goes, one year's plan lies in spring. China and Russia will seize this beautiful early spring season and work hard for the relations between the two countries and world peace and development, and will surely reap new achievements for the benefit of the two peoples and peoples of other countries. , Teachers, students! , The School of International Relations is an institution of higher learning that specializes in the research and teaching of international issues. I believe that you will pay more attention to the international situation and feel the tremendous changes of the international community in the past few decades. We are in an era of rapid change, facing a world that is constantly changing. ——In this world, peace, development, cooperation, and win-win have become the trend of the times. The old colonial system collapsed. The group confrontation during the Cold War no longer exists. No country or group of countries can dominate world affairs alone. ——In this world, a large number of emerging market countries and developing countries are on the fast track of development. The population of more than one billion and billions is accelerating towards modernization. Many development centers are gradually formed in various regions of the world. The international power comparison continues To develop in a direction conducive to world peace and development. , ——In this world, countries are more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. Human beings live in the same global village, in the same space and time where history and reality meet, and more and more become you in me and you in me. Community of fate. ——In this world, mankind is still facing many problems and challenges. The deep-seated influence of the international financial crisis continues to manifest. Various forms of protectionism have clearly increased. Regional hotspots are rising one after another. Hegemonism, power politics, and new interventionism have risen. Arms competition, Traditional and non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and cyber security are intertwined, and there is still a long way to go to maintain world peace and promote common development. , We hope the world will become better, and we have reason to believe that the world will become better. At the same time, we also know clearly that the future is bright and the road is tortuous. Chernyshevsky once wrote: ""The historical path is not the sidewalk on Nevsky Prospect, it is entirely moving in the fields, sometimes through the dust, sometimes through the mud, sometimes across the swamp, sometimes through the jungle."" Human The history of social development proves that no matter what kind of twists and turns will be encountered, history will always advance in accordance with its own laws, and there is no power to block the wheel of history. , The world's currents are vast and prosperous. To keep up with the advancement of the times, it is impossible for the body to enter the 21st century, while the head still stays in the past, stays in the old era of colonial expansion, stays in the old frame of Cold War thinking, zero-sum game. In the face of the profound changes in the international situation and the objective requirements of all countries in the world to work together, all countries should jointly promote the establishment of a new type of international relations with cooperation and win-win as the core, and people of all countries should work together to maintain world peace and promote common development. , We advocate that all countries and peoples should enjoy dignity together. It is necessary to uphold the equality of the country regardless of its size, strength, weakness and wealth, respect the right of people of all countries to choose their own development path, oppose interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and safeguard international fairness and justice. ""The shoes don't fit well, I don't know until I wear them."" The development path of a country is inappropriate, and only the people of this country have the most say. , We advocate that all countries and peoples should enjoy the fruits of development together. While pursuing its own development, each country should actively promote the common development of other countries. The long-term development of the world cannot be based on the fact that one group of countries is getting richer and the other group of countries is chronically poor and backward. Only when all countries develop together can the world develop better. The practice of believing in neighbors, passing on crises and harming oneself is neither ethical nor durable. , We advocate that all countries and peoples should enjoy security together. Countries must work together to properly respond to variousIt is neither ethical nor durable. , We advocate that all countries and peoples should enjoy security together. All countries should work together to properly deal with various problems and challenges. The more you are facing global challenges, the more you need to cooperate to cope with it, turning pressure into motivation and turning crises into life. In the face of intricate international security threats, it is impossible to fight alone, and superstition is not enough. Cooperation security, collective security, and common security are the right choices to solve the problem. With the multi-polarization of the world, the deepening development of economic globalization, cultural diversification, and social informatization, human beings today are more than ever able to move towards the goal of peace and development, and a win-win cooperation is the realization of this A realistic approach to a goal. The destiny of the world must be controlled by the people of all countries. Things within the sovereignty of each country can only be managed by their own governments and peoples, and things in the world can only be handled by the governments and peoples of all countries in consultation. This is a democratic principle for handling international affairs, and the international community should abide by it together. , Teachers, students! , In November last year, the Communist Party of China convened the 18th National Congress, which clarified China’s blueprint for a period to come, and proposed that by 2020 GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents will double on the basis of 2010. To build a well-off society in an all-round way when the Chinese Communist Party established the Party in 100 years, and to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modernized country when it was founded in 100 years. At the same time, we are soberly aware that as a large developing country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, the risks and challenges that China faces on the road of development will still be very large and severe, and it will take continuous hard work to achieve the determined goals of struggle. Work hard. The realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese people in modern times. We call it the ""Chinese dream"". The basic connotation is to realize the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the happiness of the people. The Chinese nation has always loved peace. Since modern times, the Chinese people have suffered from foreign aggression and internal wars for hundreds of years. They are well aware of the value of peace and most need to build the country in a peaceful environment in order to continuously improve people's lives. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and is committed to promoting open development, cooperative development, and win-win development. At the same time, it calls on all countries to take the path of peaceful development together. China has always pursued a defensive national defense policy, does not engage in an arms race, and does not pose a military threat to any country. China's development and growth brings more opportunities than threats to the world. The Chinese dream we want to realize not only benefits the Chinese people, but also the people of other countries. We are happy to see that China and Russia are each other’s largest neighbors, and there are many similarities in the national development blueprint. Russia proposes that by 2020, the per capita GDP will reach or approach the level of developed countries, and it is now advancing on the road of strengthening the country and enriching the people. We sincerely wish Russia to realize its goal of struggle as soon as possible. A prosperous and powerful Russia is in the interests of China and is also conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world. Sino-Russian relations are the most important set of bilateral relations in the world, and even the best set of relations among major powers. A high-level and strong Sino-Russian relationship is not only in the interest of China and Russia, but also an important guarantee for maintaining international strategic balance and world peace and stability. After more than 20 years of unremitting efforts by both sides, China and Russia have established a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation that fully takes care of each other’s interests and concerns and brings tangible benefits to the two peoples. Our two countries have completely resolved the border issues left over by history and signed the ""China-Russia Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty"", which has laid a solid foundation for the long-term development of Sino-Russian relations. At present, China and Russia are both in an important period of national rejuvenation, and the relationship between the two countries has entered a new stage of providing important development opportunities for each other and becoming each other's main priority partners. With regard to the development of Sino-Russian relations under the new situation, I think we should pay more attention to the following aspects. First, unswervingly develop future-oriented relations. It is the common wish of the two peoples that China and Russia will be friendly for generations and never be enemies. Both of us must ascend to the horizon and plan for the development of bilateral relations as a whole. President Putin said: ""Russia needs a prosperous and stable China, and China also needs a strong and successful Russia."" I completely agree with him. The common development of our two countries will provide a broader space for development of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation, and will provide positive energy for the development of the international order and international system in a fair and reasonable direction. Our two countries should always be good neighbors, good friends, and good partners, take concrete actions to firmly support each other in safeguarding their core interests, firmly support each other's development and rejuvenation, firmly support each other in taking a development path that suits their national conditions, and firmly support each other in running their own affairs. thing. Second, unswervingly develop a win-win relationship of cooperation. China and Russia have different feelings and different conditions. Working closely with each other and taking advantage of each other can make one plus one more than two.Unswervingly develop a win-win relationship for cooperation. China and Russia have different feelings and different conditions. Working closely with each other and complementing each other can play the role of one plus one greater than two. Last year, the Sino-Russian trade volume reached 88.2 billion US dollars, and personnel exchanges reached 3.3 million person-times. These figures fully reflect the huge development potential and broad development prospects of Sino-Russian relations. The energy cooperation between China and Russia continues to deepen. Following the ""Miles Tea Ceremony"" in the 17th century, the Sino-Russian oil and gas pipeline became the new ""artery of the century"" connecting the two countries. At present, our two countries are actively promoting the interconnection of their national and regional development strategies, and constantly creating more points of interest and cooperation growth. We must promote the expansion of cooperation between the two countries from energy resources to investment, infrastructure construction, high technology, finance and other fields, and from commodity import and export to joint research and development, joint production, and constantly improve the level and level of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. Third, unswervingly develop friendly relations between the two peoples. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date. The profound friendship of the people is the source of strength for the development of national relations. Here, I would like to talk about several examples of mutual support and assistance between the people of the two countries. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Kurishenko, the Soviet flying captain, came to China to fight side by side with the Chinese people. He said with emotion: ""I experience the disaster that the Chinese working people are suffering like the disaster of my motherland."" He sacrificed heroically On the land of China. The Chinese people have not forgotten this hero. A pair of ordinary Chinese mothers and children have been guarding the tomb for him for more than half a century. After the Beslan hostage incident in Russia in 2004, China invited some injured children to China for rehabilitation treatment. These children were carefully cared for in China. The Russian leader Alan said: ""Your doctors have given such great help to the children. Our children will always remember you."" After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China, Russia reached out to China for the first time and invited children from disaster-stricken areas to go to the Russian Far East for treatment. Three years ago, at the Vladivostok ""Ocean"" All-Russian Children's Center, I witnessed the care and warm care given by Russian teachers to Chinese children. The Chinese children have experienced the friendship and kindness of the Russian people, which fulfills the Chinese saying that loves no borders. There are many such moving deeds that nourish the branches of the friendship between the two peoples. Both China and Russia have a long history and a splendid culture. Humanistic exchanges have an irreplaceable role in enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. Ancient Chinese thinkers such as Confucius and Laozi were familiar to the Russian people. The older generation of Chinese revolutionaries were deeply influenced by Russian culture. Our generation also read many classic works of Russian literature. When I was young, I read the works of literary masters such as Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, etc., which made me feel the charm of Russian literature. The cultural exchange between China and Russia has a deep foundation. Youth is the future of the country, the future of the world, and the future of China-Russia friendship. During this visit to Russia, President Putin and I jointly announced that the two countries will host the China-Russia Youth Friendly Exchange Year in 2014 and 2015. China will also invite a delegation of Russian university students, including students from the Moscow Institute of International Relations, to visit China. All the students here are the elite of the Russian youth generation. I look forward to more and more Chinese and Russian youths taking over the baton of Sino-Russian friendship and actively participating in the cause of friendship between the two peoples. , Teachers, students! , There is a proverb in Russia: ""Big ships must sail."" There is an ancient Chinese poem: ""There will be long winds and waves, and there will be times when the wind and the sea will sail."" I believe that with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, Sino-Russian relations will be Can continue to ride the wind and waves, sail the voyage, better benefit the two peoples, and better promote world peace and development! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd),]",Xi Jinping: Follow the trend of the times and promote world peace and development,4164,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-03-24,"[, 尊敬的托尔库诺夫院长，, 尊敬的戈洛杰茨副总理，, 老师们，同学们：, 今天，有机会来到美丽的莫斯科国际关系学院，同各位老师、同学见面，感到十分高兴。, 莫斯科国际关系学院是享誉世界的知名学府，名师荟萃，英才辈出，我对贵院在各领域取得的优异成绩，表示热烈的祝贺！, 俄罗斯是中国的友好邻邦。这次访问俄罗斯，是我担任中国国家主席后第一次出访，是这次出访的第一站，也是时隔３年再次来到你们美丽富饶的国家。昨天，我同普京总统举行了富有成果的会谈，并共同出席了俄罗斯中国旅游年开幕式。, 早春３月，意味着一个新的万物复苏季节的到来，意味着一个新的播种的时刻的到来。常言道，一年之计在于春。中俄双方把握这美好的早春时节，为两国关系和世界和平与发展辛勤耕耘，必将收获新的成果，造福两国人民和各国人民。, 老师们、同学们！, 国际关系学院是专门从事国际问题研究和教学的高等学府，相信你们对国际形势更加关注，更能感受到过去几十年国际社会沧海桑田般的巨大变化。我们所处的是一个风云变幻的时代，面对的是一个日新月异的世界。, ——这个世界，和平、发展、合作、共赢成为时代潮流，旧的殖民体系土崩瓦解，冷战时期的集团对抗不复存在，任何国家或国家集团都再也无法单独主宰世界事务。, ——这个世界，一大批新兴市场国家和发展中国家走上发展的快车道，十几亿、几十亿人口正在加速走向现代化，多个发展中心在世界各地区逐渐形成，国际力量对比继续朝着有利于世界和平与发展的方向发展。, ——这个世界，各国相互联系、相互依存的程度空前加深，人类生活在同一个地球村里，生活在历史和现实交汇的同一个时空里，越来越成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。, ——这个世界，人类依然面临诸多难题和挑战，国际金融危机深层次影响继续显现，形形色色的保护主义明显升温，地区热点此起彼伏，霸权主义、强权政治和新干涉主义有所上升，军备竞争、恐怖主义、网络安全等传统安全威胁和非传统安全威胁相互交织，维护世界和平、促进共同发展依然任重道远。, 我们希望世界变得更加美好，我们也有理由相信，世界会变得更加美好。同时，我们也清楚地知道，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的。车尔尼雪夫斯基曾经写到：“历史的道路不是涅瓦大街上的人行道，它完全是在田野中前进的，有时穿过尘埃，有时穿过泥泞，有时横渡沼泽，有时行经丛林。”人类社会发展的历史证明，无论会遇到什么样的曲折，历史都总是按照自己的规律向前发展，没有任何力量能够阻挡历史前进的车轮。, 世界潮流，浩浩荡荡，顺之则昌，逆之则亡。要跟上时代前进步伐，就不能身体已进入２１世纪，而脑袋还停留在过去，停留在殖民扩张的旧时代里，停留在冷战思维、零和博弈老框框内。, 面对国际形势的深刻变化和世界各国同舟共济的客观要求，各国应该共同推动建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，各国人民应该一起来维护世界和平、促进共同发展。, 我们主张，各国和各国人民应该共同享受尊严。要坚持国家不分大小、强弱、贫富一律平等，尊重各国人民自主选择发展道路的权利，反对干涉别国内政，维护国际公平正义。“鞋子合不合脚，自己穿了才知道”。一个国家的发展道路合不合适，只有这个国家的人民才最有发言权。, 我们主张，各国和各国人民应该共同享受发展成果。每个国家在谋求自身发展的同时，要积极促进其他各国共同发展。世界长期发展不可能建立在一批国家越来越富裕而另一批国家却长期贫穷落后的基础之上。只有各国共同发展了，世界才能更好发展。那种以邻为壑、转嫁危机、损人利己的做法既不道德，也难以持久。, 我们主张，各国和各国人民应该共同享受安全保障。各国要同心协力，妥善应对各种问题和挑战。越是面临全球性挑战，越要合作应对，共同变压力为动力、化危机为生机。面对错综复杂的国际安全威胁，单打独斗不行，迷信武力更不行，合作安全、集体安全、共同安全才是解决问题的正确选择。, 随着世界多极化、经济全球化深入发展和文化多样化、社会信息化持续推进，今天的人类比以往任何时候都更有条件朝和平与发展的目标迈进，而合作共赢就是实现这一目标的现实途径。, 世界的命运必须由各国人民共同掌握。各国主权范围内的事情只能由本国政府和人民去管，世界上的事情只能由各国政府和人民共同商量来办。这是处理国际事务的民主原则，国际社会应该共同遵守。, 老师们、同学们！, 去年１１月，中国共产党召开了第十八次全国代表大会，明确了今后一个时期中国的发展蓝图，提出到２０２０年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入将在２０１０年的基础上翻一番，在中国共产党建党１００年时全面建成小康社会，在新中国成立１００年时建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。同时，我们也清醒地认识到，作为拥有１３亿多人口的发展中大国，中国在发展道路上面临的风险和挑战依然会很大、很严峻，要实现已确定的奋斗目标必须付出持续的艰辛努力。, 实现中华民族伟大复兴，是近代以来中国人民最伟大的梦想，我们称之为“中国梦”，基本内涵是实现国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福。中华民族历来爱好和平。近代以来，中国人民蒙受了外国侵略和内部战乱的百年苦难，深知和平的宝贵，最需要在和平环境中进行国家建设，以不断改善人民生活。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，致力于促进开放的发展、合作的发展、共赢的发展，同时呼吁各国共同走和平发展道路。中国始终奉行防御性的国防政策，不搞军备竞赛，不对任何国家构成军事威胁。中国发展壮大，带给世界的是更多机遇而不是什么威胁。我们要实现的中国梦，不仅造福中国人民，而且造福各国人民。, 我们高兴地看到，中俄两国互为最大邻国，在国家发展蓝图上有很多契合之处。俄罗斯提出到２０２０年人均国内生产总值将达到或接近发达国家水平的目标，现在正在强国富民的道路上加快前进。我们衷心祝愿俄罗斯早日实现自己的奋斗目标。一个繁荣强大的俄罗斯，符合中国利益，也有利于亚太与世界和平稳定。, 中俄关系是世界上最重要的一组双边关系，更是最好的一组大国关系。一个高水平、强有力的中俄关系，不仅符合中俄双方利益，也是维护国际战略平衡和世界和平稳定的重要保障。经过双方２０多年不懈努力，中俄建立起全面战略协作伙伴关系，这种关系充分照顾对方利益和关切，给两国人民带来了实实在在的好处。我们两国彻底解决了历史遗留的边界问题，签署了《中俄睦邻友好合作条约》，为中俄关系长远发展奠定了坚实基础。, 当前，中俄都处在民族复兴的重要时期，两国关系已进入互相提供重要发展机遇、互为主要优先合作伙伴的新阶段。对发展新形势下的中俄关系，我认为应该在以下几个方面多下功夫。, 第一，坚定不移发展面向未来的关系。中俄世代友好、永不为敌，是两国人民共同心愿。我们双方要登高望远，统筹谋划两国关系发展。普京总统讲过：“俄罗斯需要一个繁荣稳定的中国，中国也需要一个强大成功的俄罗斯。”我完全同意他的看法。我们两国共同发展，将给中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系提供更广阔发展空间，将为国际秩序和国际体系朝着公正合理的方向发展提供正能量。我们两国要永做好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴，以实际行动坚定支持对方维护本国核心利益，坚定支持对方发展复兴，坚定支持对方走符合本国国情的发展道路，坚定支持对方办好自己的事情。, 第二，坚定不移发展合作共赢的关系。中俄国情不同、条件各异，彼此密切合作、取长补短可以起到一加一大于二的效果。去年，中俄贸易额达到８８２亿美元，人员交流达到３３０万人次，这些数字充分反映出中俄关系的巨大发展潜力和广阔发展前景。中俄两国的能源合作不断深化。继１７世纪的“万里茶道”之后，中俄油气管道成为联通两国新的“世纪动脉”。当前，我们两国正积极推动各自国家和地区发展战略相互对接，不断创造出更多利益契合点和合作增长点。我们要推动两国合作从能源资源向投资、基础设施建设、高技术、金融等领域拓展，从商品进出口向联合研发、联合生产转变，不断提高两国务实合作层次和水平。, 第三，坚定不移发展两国人民友好关系。国之交在于民相亲。人民的深厚友谊是国家关系发展的力量源泉。这里，我想讲几个两国人民相互支持和帮助的事例。抗日战争时期，苏联飞行大队长库里申科来华同中国人民并肩作战，他动情地说：“我像体验我的祖国的灾难一样，体验着中国劳动人民正在遭受的灾难。”他英勇牺牲在中国大地上。中国人民没有忘记这位英雄，一对普通的中国母子已为他守陵半个多世纪。２００４年俄罗斯发生别斯兰人质事件后，中国邀请部分受伤儿童赴华接受康复治疗，这些孩子在中国受到精心照料，俄方带队医生阿兰表示：“你们的医生给孩子们这么大的帮助，我们的孩子会永远记住你们的。”２００８年中国汶川特大地震发生后，俄罗斯在第一时间向中国伸出援手，并邀请灾区孩子到俄罗斯远东等地疗养。３年前，我在符拉迪沃斯托克“海洋”全俄儿童中心，亲眼目睹了俄罗斯老师给予中国儿童的悉心照料和温馨关怀。中国孩子亲身体会到了俄罗斯人民的友爱和善良，这应验了大爱无疆这句中国人常说的话。这样的感人事迹还有很多，滋润着两国人民友谊之树枝繁叶茂。, 中俄两国都具有悠久的历史、灿烂的文化，人文交流对增进两国人民友谊具有不可替代的作用。孔子、老子等中国古代思想家为俄罗斯人民所熟悉。中国老一辈革命家深受俄罗斯文化影响，我们这一代人也读了很多俄罗斯文学的经典作品。我年轻时就读过普希金、莱蒙托夫、屠格涅夫、陀思妥耶夫斯基、托尔斯泰、契诃夫等文学巨匠的作品，让我感受到俄罗斯文学的魅力。中俄两国文化交流有着深厚基础。, 青年是国家的未来，是世界的未来，也是中俄友好事业的未来。这次访俄期间，我和普京总统共同宣布，两国将于２０１４年和２０１５年互办中俄青年友好交流年。中方还将邀请包括莫斯科国际关系学院学生在内的俄罗斯大学生代表团访华。在座各位同学是俄罗斯青年一代的精英。我期待着越来越多的中俄青年接过中俄友谊的接力棒，积极投身两国人民友好事业。, 老师们、同学们！, 俄罗斯有句谚语：“大船必能远航。”中国有句古诗：“长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海。”我相信，在两国政府和人民共同努力下，中俄关系一定能够继续乘风破浪、扬帆远航，更好造福两国人民，更好促进世界和平与发展！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社莫斯科３月２３日电）, ]",习近平：顺应时代前进潮流 促进世界和平发展,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/20893328
10,154,"[, Dear Chairman of Valdana,, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends:, Today, there are a lot of high-spirited people here. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet friends from the Asia-Pacific business community on the beautiful paradise island. , This is not only a world-famous tourist destination, but also the birthplace of the Bali process and the Bali road map. The informal meeting of APEC leaders in Bali was held in Bali and carried the expectations of Asia-Pacific and the world. At present, the recovery of the world economy is difficult and tortuous. The Asia-Pacific economy has maintained a good momentum of development and is also facing new challenges. It is expected that this meeting will inject new vitality into the regional and global economic growth. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The world economy is still in a period of in-depth adjustment. There are signs of recovery, but also problems of unstable foundation, insufficient power and uneven speed. The structural problems of major developed economies are far from being resolved, and the need to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination is outstanding. The growth of emerging market economies has slowed, and external risks and challenges have increased. The World Trade Organization's Doha round of negotiations is struggling, and trade and investment protectionism have shown new signs. Achieving a comprehensive recovery and healthy growth of the world economy will be a long and tortuous process. In the face of new challenges brought about by the world economic situation, both developed and developing economies are striving to seek new growth drivers. , Where do the growth drivers come from? My view is that it can only come from reform, from adjustment, and from innovation. Asia-Pacific has always been an important engine of world economic growth. In the context of the lack of momentum for world economic recovery, Asia-Pacific economies should show the courage to take the lead in the world and promote the establishment of an open economic development model of development, innovation, growth linkage, and integration of interests. Only in this way can ""the mountains and rivers have no doubts and there is nowhere to go, and there will be another village in the dark, the flowers will bloom in the dark,"" and the Asia-Pacific economy will play a leading role in the world economic recovery. China is making such efforts. In the first half of the year, China's economy grew by 7.6% year-on-year, which has indeed slowed down from the previous 8% growth rate. Some friends are worried about China's economic prospects, and some people have asked some questions: Will the Chinese economy ""hard landing""? Can the Chinese economy continue to develop healthily? How will China respond? What impact will China's economic situation have on Asia Pacific? In this regard, I would like to make a few observations. , First of all, I want to emphasize that by comprehensively analyzing various aspects of the situation, I have full confidence in China's economic development prospects. First, confidence comes from the fact that China's economic growth is within a reasonable range and within the expected target. The growth rate of China's economy has increased from the previous double-digit figures to 9.3% in 2011 and 7.8% in 2012, and then to 7.6% in the first half of this year. Overall, a smooth transition has been achieved. The growth rate of 7.6% ranks among the leading economies in the world. The fundamentals of China's economy are good, economic growth and other major economic indicators remain within expected targets, everything is expected, and no accidents have occurred. The slowdown of China's economic growth is the result of China's active regulation. This is because to achieve our goal of doubling GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents by 2020 compared with 2010, a growth rate of 7% is sufficient. We made full calculations when we proposed the mid- and long-term development goals. At the same time, we recognize that in order to fundamentally solve the long-term development of China's economy, we must resolutely promote structural reforms and prefer to slow down the growth rate. Any career needs to be balanced and far-sighted, and the development of killing chickens for eggs, exhausting and fishing will not last long. Second, confidence comes from the steady improvement of the quality and efficiency of China's economic development. In the first half of this year, China's economic development was characterized by overall stability and progress. ""Stable"" means that the economic growth is within a reasonable range, and ""advance"" means that the pace of change in the mode of economic development is accelerating. China's economic development is shifting from relying too much on investment and export-driven to rely more on domestic demand, especially consumer demand. From the economic data of the first half of the year, the driving force of structural adjustment is showing up. Domestic demand is driving economic growth by 7.5 percentage points, of which consumption is driving 3.4 percentage points. We no longer simply take the hero of GDP growth rate as an argument, but emphasize that we should take the stand of improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth. Facts have proved that this policy is responsible, both for China itself and the world. Third, confidence comes from the strong endogenous power of the Chinese economy. The endogenous power of China's economic development is increasing and will continue to increase. Continued new urbanization will create new space for hundreds of millions of Chinese people from rural areas to cities and to a higher level of life. China's education level continues to improve, a new generation of laborIt will create new space for hundreds of millions of Chinese people from rural areas to cities and to a higher level of life. China's education level continues to improve, and a new generation of laborers has grown into modern, professional talents with higher qualities, broader horizons, and stronger skills. China vigorously implements an innovation-driven development strategy, promotes the close integration of science and technology and the economy, and promotes the development of technological innovation and emerging industries. China's expanding domestic demand and consumer market will release huge demand and consumption power. China adheres to the people-oriented concept and promotes the achievements of development to benefit a wider area and a larger number of people. These will be transformed into a strong internal driving force to promote China's economic development. Fourth, confidence comes from the good prospects for Asia-Pacific development. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Asia-Pacific economies, the flow of funds, information and personnel in the Asia-Pacific region has reached a very high level, the industrial division of labor is becoming clearer, and the Asia-Pacific market has begun to take shape. The new technological revolution and industrial revolution that are brewing will accumulate advantages for the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific economies have greatly enhanced their ability to resist risks, the exchange rate mechanism has become more flexible, and the level of foreign exchange reserves has increased significantly. Various multilateral and bilateral financial arrangements have provided a mechanism to protect against complex situations. China has confidence in the prospects for Asia-Pacific development. Benefiting from the great environment of Asia-Pacific economic growth, China has achieved its own development, while at the same time contributing to Asia-Pacific economic growth with its own development. I believe that this interactive momentum will become stronger and stronger, creating more opportunities for the development of the Asia-Pacific region. , I have firm confidence in the sustained and healthy development of the Chinese economy. At the same time, we maintain a clear understanding of problems and challenges such as declining demand, overcapacity, local debt, and shadow banking. We are highly concerned about the possible impact of the external environment and are taking stable measures to prevent them from happening. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The Chinese economy has entered a new stage of development and is undergoing profound mode changes and structural adjustments. This requires constantly climbing hills and overcoming difficulties. This will inevitably be accompanied by pains of adjustment and growing troubles, but these are all worth the price. , Rainbow often appears after wind and rain. There is a good saying, there is no mountain higher than people, there is no way longer than feet. No matter how high the mountain or long road, as long as we persevere forward, there will be a day to achieve our goal. If China wants to move forward, it must comprehensively deepen reform and opening up. Facing the new expectations of the masses of the people, we must strengthen our confidence in reform and opening up, advance reform and opening up with greater political courage and wisdom, and use more effective measures and methods to further emancipate the mind, emancipate and develop social productive forces, and emancipate and enhance social creativity. , China is formulating a comprehensive plan to deepen reforms. The general goal is to coordinate reforms in the fields of economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and strive to solve the difficulties in the development process and eliminate the institutional mechanisms for sustained and healthy economic development. Obstacles, adding new impetus to economic development through reforms. , We will improve the basic economic system, strengthen the construction of the market system, promote the reform of the macro-control, fiscal, taxation, finance, and investment sectors, deepen the market-oriented reform of interest rates and exchange rates, enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and gradually realize the convertibility of RMB capital items. We will promote the reform of the administrative system, further transform functions, simplify administration and decentralization, straighten out the relationship between the government and the market, and play a greater role in the basic role of the market in resource allocation. We will improve the scientific and technological system, improve the technological innovation capability, and strive to build a technological innovation system that is enterprise-centered, market-oriented, and combines industry, education, and research. We will focus on safeguarding and improving people's livelihood, promote social equity and justice, promote higher-quality employment, deepen the reform of the income distribution system, and improve the social security system and basic public service system. We will strengthen ecological environment protection, solidly promote resource conservation, create a good production and living environment for the people, and make new contributions to coping with global climate change. , We will implement a more proactive opening strategy, improve a mutually beneficial and win-win, diversified balance, safe and efficient open economic system, promote the complementarity of coastal and inland opening advantages, form an open area that leads international economic cooperation and competition, and cultivate and drive areas Open highlands for development. Adhere to the importance of both export and import to promote the balanced development of foreign trade; adhere to the importance of ""importing"" and ""going out"" to improve the level of international investment cooperation; deepen the reform of investment and trade systems, improve laws and regulations, and create fair business for companies in China Rule of law environment. We will coordinate bilateral, multilateral, and regional subregional open cooperation, accelerate the implementation of the free trade zone strategy, and promote connectivity with neighboring countries. , We recognize that reform is a profound revolution involving major interest relationship adjustments and the improvement of various systems and mechanisms. China's reforms have entered a tough period and deep water areas. This is because the problems that need to be resolved in the current reform are extremely difficult, and they are all hard to eat. At this time, we must work hard and look forward.Period and deep water area. This is because the problems that need to be solved in the current reform are extremely difficult, and they are all hard-to-bear hard bones. At this time, we must work hard together. Looking forward and backward, not only can not advance, but may give up. China is a big country, and it must not have subversive mistakes on fundamental issues. Once it appears, there is no way to remedy or make up for it. Our position is to be courageous and to be steady. We must not only explore boldly and be brave, but also be prudent and think carefully. We must stick to the correct direction of reform and opening up, dare to bite hard bones, dare to take risks, and dare to attack the stubborn disease that has accumulated for many years, so as to effectively achieve non-stop reform and openness. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Asia-Pacific is a big family, and China is a member of the big family. China's development is inseparable from the Asia-Pacific, and Asia-Pacific prosperity is also inseparable from China. The sustained and healthy development of China's economy will bring greater opportunities for Asia-Pacific development. , China will firmly maintain regional peace and stability and lay a solid foundation for a win-win situation in the Asia-Pacific region. I have said on many occasions this year, such as the Boao Forum for Asia, that peace is like air and sunshine, benefiting without realizing it, and losing it is hard to survive. Without peace, development is water without a source and a tree without a root. China is a member of the Asia-Pacific family and is willing to live in harmony with all family members and help each other. It is also hoped that all parties in the Asia-Pacific region will cherish the hard-won peace and stability situation and jointly promote a harmonious and prosperous harmony. Asia Pacific. , China will vigorously promote regional development and prosperity and expand opportunities for a win-win situation in the Asia-Pacific region. China is the largest trading partner, the largest export market, and the main source of investment for many economies in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, China's contribution rate to Asian economic growth has exceeded 50%. As of the end of 2012, China had accumulatively approved more than 76,000 foreign-invested enterprises, and foreign direct investment was approximately US$1.3 trillion. China has signed 12 free trade agreements with 20 countries and regions, and 6 are under negotiation. Most of the free trade partners are APEC members. In the next five years, China’s imports will exceed US$10 trillion, foreign investment will exceed US$500 billion, and outbound tourism will exceed 400 million. As China's domestic demand, especially consumption and investment, expands, it will bring more opportunities for foreign investors to cooperate. , China will devote itself to building a regional cooperation framework across the Pacific and benefiting all parties. The Pacific Ocean is vast because it does not have any natural barriers, and we should not set artificial barriers for it. We should give full play to the leading and coordinating role of APEC, uphold the ideas of openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit and win-win results, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, promote the coordination of regional free trade arrangements, deepen the process of regional integration, prevent the ""spaghetti bowl"" phenomenon, and promote the The two sides of the Pacific will build closer partnerships and seek for the long-term development of the Asia-Pacific. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , ""Huge and impertinent, sailing but trade faith."" Asia-Pacific is the space for our common development. We are all sails moving forward in this sea of ​​Asia-Pacific. The future development of Asia-Pacific is of interest to each member of APEC. , China is looking forward to this informal meeting of APEC leaders and hopes to join hands with partners in the Asia-Pacific region to jointly create a beautiful Asia-Pacific that will lead the world, benefit all parties, and benefit future generations. In this regard, I would like to share the four-point vision. First, the Asia-Pacific region should seek common development. Asia-Pacific economies are closely linked and their interests are intertwined. It is necessary to give full play to their respective advantages, optimize the allocation of economic resources, improve the industrial layout, build an Asia-Pacific value chain with shared benefits, and cultivate a large Asia-Pacific market for all inclusive parties. Developed economies should provide more support and assistance to developing economies, and the latter should also catch up. Only by narrowing the development gap will the Asia-Pacific region be able to rise. Second, the Asia-Pacific region should insist on open development. After the end of the Second World War, 13 economies around the world have achieved rapid growth for more than 25 years. Their common feature is the adoption of an open policy. We must follow the trend of the times, maintain a free, open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system and oppose all forms of protectionism. We must work together to build an open economy and regional cooperation framework and advance the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area with an open and inclusive spirit. Third, the Asia-Pacific region should promote innovation and development. Growth based solely on fiscal stimulus policies and unconventional monetary policies is unsustainable, and growth based on excessive resource consumption and environmental pollution is not worth the gains. We must not only innovate development ideas, but also innovate development methods. It is necessary to break the old mindset and rules and regulations, and adhere to green development, circular development, and low-carbon development. It is necessary to continuously improve innovation capabilities, cultivate new industries with innovation, explore growth power with innovation, and enhance core competitiveness with innovation. Fourthly, the Asia-Pacific region should seek joint development. The interests of the economies in the Asia-Pacific region are blended, with a shared destiny, both glory and lossEnhance core competitiveness. Fourthly, the Asia-Pacific region should seek joint development. The interests of the economies in the Asia-Pacific region are blended, and the destiny is common, both glory and loss. In this dynamically balanced chain, the development of each economy will have a ripple effect on other economies. We must firmly establish the consciousness of the community of shared destiny in the Asia-Pacific region, drive the development of others through our own development, maximize the advantages of each other through coordination and linkage, conduct positive energy, and form a pattern of benign interaction and coordinated development among economies. At present, Asian countries, especially emerging markets and developing countries, have huge demand for financing for infrastructure construction. In particular, they have recently faced severe challenges such as increased economic downside risks and financial market turmoil. It is necessary to mobilize more funds for infrastructure construction. Maintain sustained and stable economic growth and promote regional interconnection and economic integration. To this end, China proposes to establish an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and is willing to provide financial support to the infrastructure construction of developing countries in the region, including ASEAN countries. The new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will work with existing multilateral development banks in and outside the region to work together to complement each other and jointly promote the sustained and stable development of the Asian economy. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The business sector is the main force driving economic and trade development and an indispensable force for advancing APEC cooperation. China attaches great importance to the role of the business community and is willing to listen to the opinions and suggestions of the business community, paving the way for the business community, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to further facilitate participation in economic development and regional cooperation. In August this year, the Chinese business community established the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation China Business Council, which provided a mechanism to ensure deep participation in the formulation of Asia-Pacific economic and trade rules, reflecting the Chinese business community’s positive attitude to assume international responsibilities. , Friends have more ways to go. Many of the friends in the business community here are participants in China's reform and opening up and are old friends of the Chinese people. We will not forget old friends, but also make new friends. China welcomes and encourages various economies, especially APEC member companies, to invest in China and actively participate in China's reform and opening up. The more friends, the more prosperous and developed China's reform and opening up will be. , I hope that all friends in the business community can make full use of the APEC platform to give their voices to improve the Asia-Pacific trade and investment environment; actively use the advantages of the business community in market information, technology incubation, innovation-driven and other aspects, and put forward strategic and forward-looking recommendations, Suggestions on promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepening regional economic integration, and the future development of APEC. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! In 2014, China will host an informal meeting of APEC leaders and related activities. We will use this as an opportunity to face the future, seek to establish closer partnership, deepen pragmatic cooperation, promote APEC to play a greater leading role, and outline the long-term development vision of Asia-Pacific. It is hoped that the representatives of the Asia-Pacific business community here will go to Beijing to discuss major events and witness another important moment in Asia-Pacific development. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Bali, Indonesia, October 7), ""People's Daily"" (October 08, 2013, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the APEC Business Leaders Summit,5469,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-10-08,"[, 尊敬的瓦尔达纳主席，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 今天，这里高朋满座、群英荟萃。有机会同亚太工商界的朋友们相聚在美丽的天堂之岛，我感到十分高兴。, 这里不仅是举世闻名的旅游胜地，也是巴厘进程、巴厘路线图等的诞生地。这次亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议在巴厘岛举行，承载着亚太和世界的期待。, 当前，世界经济复苏艰难曲折，亚太经济保持了良好发展势头，同时也面临着新的挑战。人们期待这次会议能为本地区乃至全球经济增长注入新的活力。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 世界经济仍然处于深度调整期，既有复苏迹象，也面临基础不稳、动力不足、速度不均的问题。主要发达经济体的结构性问题远未解决，加强宏观经济政策协调的必要性突出。新兴市场经济体增速放缓，外部风险和挑战增加。世界贸易组织多哈回合谈判举步维艰，贸易和投资保护主义有新的表现。实现世界经济全面复苏和健康成长，将是一个长期而曲折的过程。, 面对世界经济形势带来的新挑战，无论是发达经济体还是发展中经济体，都在努力寻求新的增长动力。, 增长动力从哪里来？我的看法是，只能从改革中来，从调整中来，从创新中来。亚太一直是世界经济增长的重要引擎，在世界经济复苏缺乏动力的背景下，亚太经济体应该拿出敢为天下先的勇气，推动建立发展创新、增长联动、利益融合的开放型经济发展方式。只有这样，才能做到“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，使亚太经济在世界经济复苏中发挥引领作用。, 中国正在进行着这样的努力。上半年，中国经济同比增长７．６％，较之以往８％以上的增速确实有所放缓。一些朋友对中国经济前景有些担心，有的人提出了一些问题：中国经济会不会“硬着陆”？中国经济能不能持续健康发展？中国将如何应对？中国经济形势会给亚太带来什么影响？对此，我愿谈几点看法。, 首先，我要强调的是，综合分析各方面情况，我对中国经济发展前景充满信心。, 第一，信心来自于中国经济增速处在合理区间和预期目标内。中国经济增速从以前的两位数增长到２０１１年的９．３％和２０１２年的７．８％，再到今年上半年的７．６％，总体上实现了平稳过渡。７．６％的增长，在世界主要经济体中名列前茅。中国经济基本面是好的，经济增长及其他主要经济指标保持在预期目标之内，一切都在预料之中，没有什么意外发生。, 中国经济增速有所趋缓是中国主动调控的结果。因为，实现我们确定的到２０２０年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比２０１０年翻一番的目标，只要７％的增速就够了。我们在提出中长期发展目标时就充分进行了测算。同时，我们认识到，为了从根本上解决中国经济长远发展问题，必须坚定推动结构改革，宁可将增长速度降下来一些。任何一项事业，都需要远近兼顾、深谋远虑，杀鸡取卵、竭泽而渔式的发展是不会长久的。, 第二，信心来自于中国经济发展质量和效益稳步提升。今年上半年，中国经济发展的特点是总体平稳、稳中有进。“稳”是指经济增长处在合理区间，“进”是指经济发展方式转变步伐加快。中国经济发展正在从以往过于依赖投资和出口拉动向更多依靠国内需求特别是消费需求拉动转变。从上半年经济数据看，结构调整的拉动作用正在显现，内需拉动经济增长７．５个百分点，其中消费拉动３．４个百分点。我们不再简单以国内生产总值增长率论英雄，而是强调以提高经济增长质量和效益为立足点。事实证明，这一政策是负责任的，既是对中国自身负责，也是对世界负责。, 第三，信心来自于中国经济的强劲内生动力。中国经济发展的内生动力正在不断增加，并将继续增强。持续进行的新型城镇化，将为数以亿计的中国人从农村走向城市、走向更高水平的生活创造新空间。中国教育水平不断提高，新一代劳动者成长为素质更高、视野更广、技能更强的现代化、专业化人才。中国大力实施创新驱动发展战略，推动科技和经济紧密结合，推动科技创新和新兴产业发展。中国不断拓展的内需和消费市场，将释放巨大需求和消费动力。中国坚持以人为本的理念，推动发展成果惠及更广泛地区、更广大民众。这些都将转化为推动中国经济发展的强劲内在动力。, 第四，信心来自于亚太发展的良好前景。在亚太各经济体共同努力下，亚太地区资金、信息、人员流动已经达到很高水平，产业分工日渐清晰，亚太大市场初具轮廓。正在酝酿的新科技革命和产业革命将为亚太地区积聚优势。亚太各经济体抗风险能力大大增强，汇率机制更加灵活，外汇储备水平显著提高，各种多边和双边金融安排为应对复杂局面提供了机制保障。中国对亚太发展前景抱有信心。受益于亚太经济增长大环境，中国实现了自身发展，同时又以自身发展为亚太经济增长作出了贡献。我相信，这一互动势头会越来越强劲，为亚太地区发展创造更多机遇。, 我对中国经济持续健康发展抱着坚定信心。同时，我们对需求下滑、产能过剩、地方债务、影子银行等问题和挑战保持着清醒认识，对外部环境可能带来的冲击高度关注，正在采取稳妥应对举措，防患于未然。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国经济已经进入新的发展阶段，正在进行深刻的方式转变和结构调整。这就要不断爬坡过坎、攻坚克难。这必然伴随调整的阵痛、成长的烦恼，但这些都是值得付出的代价。, 彩虹往往出现在风雨之后。有句话说得好，没有比人更高的山，没有比脚更长的路。再高的山、再长的路，只要我们锲而不舍前进，就有达到目的的那一天。, 中国要前进，就要全面深化改革开放。面对人民群众新期待，我们必须坚定改革开放信心，以更大的政治勇气和智慧、更有力的措施和办法推进改革开放，进一步解放思想、解放和发展社会生产力、解放和增强社会创造活力。, 中国正在制定全面深化改革的总体方案，总的是要统筹推进经济、政治、文化、社会、生态文明建设等领域的改革，努力破解发展过程中出现的难题，消除经济持续健康发展的体制机制障碍，通过改革为经济发展增添新动力。, 我们将完善基本经济制度，加强市场体系建设，推进宏观调控、财税、金融、投资领域体制改革，深化利率和汇率市场化改革，增强人民币汇率弹性，逐步实现人民币资本项目可兑换。我们将推进行政体制改革，进一步转变职能、简政放权，理顺政府和市场关系，更大程度更广范围发挥市场在资源配置中的基础性作用。我们将健全科技体制，提高科技创新能力，着力构建以企业为主体、市场为导向、产学研相结合的技术创新体系。我们将以保障和改善民生为重点，促进社会公平正义，推动实现更高质量的就业，深化收入分配制度改革，健全社会保障体系和基本公共服务体系。我们将加强生态环境保护，扎实推进资源节约，为人民创造良好生产生活环境，为应对全球气候变化作出新的贡献。, 我们将实行更加积极主动的开放战略，完善互利共赢、多元平衡、安全高效的开放型经济体系，促进沿海内陆沿边开放优势互补，形成引领国际经济合作和竞争的开放区域，培育带动区域发展的开放高地。坚持出口和进口并重，推动对外贸易平衡发展；坚持“引进来”和“走出去”并重，提高国际投资合作水平；深化涉及投资、贸易体制改革，完善法律法规，为各国在华企业创造公平经营的法治环境。我们将统筹双边、多边、区域次区域开放合作，加快实施自由贸易区战略，推动同周边国家互联互通。, 我们认识到，改革是一场深刻的革命，涉及重大利益关系调整，涉及各方面体制机制完善。中国改革已进入攻坚期和深水区。这是因为，当前改革需要解决的问题格外艰巨，都是难啃的硬骨头，这个时候就要一鼓作气，瞻前顾后、畏葸不前不仅不能前进，而且可能前功尽弃。, 中国是一个大国，决不能在根本性问题上出现颠覆性错误，一旦出现就无法挽回、无法弥补。我们的立场是胆子要大、步子要稳，既要大胆探索、勇于开拓，也要稳妥审慎、三思而后行。我们要坚持改革开放正确方向，敢于啃硬骨头，敢于涉险滩，敢于向积存多年的顽瘴痼疾开刀，切实做到改革不停顿、开放不止步。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 亚太是个大家庭，中国是大家庭中的一员。中国发展离不开亚太，亚太繁荣也离不开中国。中国经济持续健康发展，将会给亚太发展带来更大机遇。, 中国将坚定维护地区和平稳定，为亚太共赢夯实基础。我在今年博鳌亚洲论坛等多个场合说过，和平犹如空气和阳光，受益而不觉，失之则难存。没有和平，发展就是无源之水、无本之木。家和万事兴，中国是亚太大家庭的一员，愿意同所有家庭成员和睦相处、守望相助，也希望亚太各方能珍惜来之不易的和平稳定局面，共同推动建设一个持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐亚太。, 中国将大力促进地区发展繁荣，为亚太共赢拓展机遇。中国是亚太许多经济体的最大贸易伙伴、最大出口市场、主要投资来源地。２０１２年，中国对亚洲经济增长的贡献率已经超过５０％。截至２０１２年底，中国累计批准外商投资企业７６万多家，外商直接投资约１．３万亿美元。中国已经同２０个国家和地区签署了１２个自由贸易协定，正在谈判的有６个，其中大多数自由贸易伙伴是亚太经合组织成员。今后５年，中国进口商品将超过１０万亿美元，对外投资将超过５０００亿美元，出境旅游将超过４亿人次。随着中国国内需求特别是消费和投资需求扩大，将给国外投资者带来更多合作机会。, 中国将致力于构建横跨太平洋两岸、惠及各方的地区合作框架。太平洋之所以广大，是因为它没有任何自然阻隔，我们不应该为它设定人为的阻隔。我们要发挥亚太经合组织引领和协调作用，秉持开放包容、互利共赢思想，加强宏观经济政策协调、促进区域自由贸易安排的协调，深化区域一体化进程，防止出现“意大利面碗”现象，推动在太平洋两岸构建更紧密伙伴关系，共谋亚太长远发展。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, “浩渺行无极，扬帆但信风。”亚太是我们共同发展的空间，我们都是亚太这片大海中前行的风帆。亚太未来发展攸关亚太经合组织每个成员的利益。, 中国对本次亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议充满期待，希望同亚太伙伴们携手同心，共同创建引领世界、惠及各方、造福子孙的美好亚太。对此，我愿分享４点愿景。, 第一，亚太地区应该谋求共同发展。亚太各经济体联系紧密、利益交融，要充分发挥各自优势，优化经济资源配置，完善产业布局，建设利益共享的亚太价值链，培育普惠各方的亚太大市场。发达经济体应该为发展中经济体提供更多支持和帮助，后者也要迎头赶上。只有缩小发展差距，亚太才能水涨船高。, 第二，亚太地区应该坚持开放发展。第二次世界大战结束后，全球有１３个经济体实现２５年多的高速增长，其共同特征就是采取开放政策。我们要顺应时代潮流，维护自由、开放、非歧视的多边贸易体制，反对各种形式的保护主义。我们要携手建设开放型经济和区域合作框架，以开放包容精神推进亚太自由贸易区建设。, 第三，亚太地区应该推动创新发展。单纯依靠财政刺激政策和非常规货币政策的增长不可持续，建立在过度资源消耗和环境污染基础上的增长得不偿失。我们既要创新发展思路，也要创新发展手段。要打破旧的思维定式和条条框框，坚持绿色发展、循环发展、低碳发展。要不断提高创新能力，用创新培育新兴产业，用创新发掘增长动力，用创新提升核心竞争力。, 第四，亚太地区应该寻求联动发展。亚太各经济体利益交融，命运与共，一荣俱荣，一损俱损。在这个动态平衡的链条中，每个经济体的发展都会对其他经济体产生连锁反应。我们要牢固树立亚太命运共同体意识，以自身发展带动他人发展，以协调联动最大限度发挥各自优势，传导正能量，形成各经济体良性互动、协调发展的格局。, 当前，亚洲国家特别是新兴市场和发展中国家的基础设施建设融资需求巨大，特别是近来还面临经济下行风险增大和金融市场动荡等严峻挑战，有必要动员更多资金进行基础设施建设，以保持经济持续稳定增长，促进区域互联互通和经济一体化。为此，中国倡议筹建亚洲基础设施投资银行，愿向包括东盟国家在内的本地区发展中国家的基础设施建设提供资金支持。新的亚洲基础设施投资银行将与域内外现有多边开发银行一道，共同合作，相互补充，共同促进亚洲经济的持续稳定发展。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 工商界是推动经济和贸易发展的主力军，也是推进亚太经合组织合作不可或缺的重要力量。中国高度重视工商界作用，愿意倾听工商界意见和建议，为工商界尤其是中小微企业深入便利参与经济发展和区域合作搭桥铺路。, 今年８月，中国工商界成立了亚太经合组织中国工商理事会，为深入参与亚太经贸规则制定提供了机制保障，体现了中国工商界承担国际责任的积极态度。, 朋友多了路好走。在座的许多工商界朋友，都是中国改革开放事业的参与者，是中国人民的老朋友。我们不会忘记老朋友，也愿结交新朋友。中国欢迎和鼓励各经济体特别是亚太经合组织成员企业来华投资兴业，积极参与中国改革开放。朋友越多，中国改革开放事业就越兴旺、越发达。, 希望各位工商界朋友充分利用亚太经合组织平台，为改善亚太贸易和投资环境发出自己的声音；积极发挥工商界在市场信息、技术孵化、创新驱动等方面的优势，提出战略性和前瞻性建议，就推动贸易和投资自由化便利化、深化区域经济一体化、亚太经合组织未来发展等建言献策。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, ２０１４年中国将主办亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议及相关活动。我们将以此为契机，面向未来，谋求建立更紧密伙伴关系，深化务实合作，推动亚太经合组织发挥更大引领作用，勾画亚太长远发展愿景。, 希望在座的亚太工商界代表到时共赴北京，共商大事，一起见证亚太发展的又一重要时刻。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社印度尼西亚巴厘岛１０月７日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年10月08日 03 版）,

11,155,"[, Dear Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament Mazuki and deputy speakers, Dear President of the Indonesian People’s Association Sidarto and Vice-Chairmen, Dear President of the Indonesian Council of Local Representatives Ilman and Vice-Chairmen, Friends of Members of Parliament ,, ministers, ladies and gentlemen, friends: 　　 Abagaba! Hello everyone! Today, I have the opportunity to come to the Indonesian Parliament and meet my friends, and I am very happy. , 　　 At the invitation of President Susilo, I paid a visit to Indonesia, known as ""the country of a thousand islands"". This is the first stop of my trip to Southeast Asia. It is a journey of inheriting friendly relations and a trip of planning cooperation. , 　　 First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends present here and to the brotherly Indonesian people! , 　　 Twenty years ago, I visited your country and experienced the development of Indonesia and the rich nature and culture. 20 years of flicking, but the scene at that time seems to have happened yesterday, still vivid. Once again set foot on this beautiful land, I felt the vigorous vitality of the relations between the two countries more deeply, and I deeply felt the profound friendship of the people of the two countries. In recent years, under the leadership of President Susilo, the Indonesian people have united and worked hard to create a good situation in economic development, social stability and national strength. I sincerely wish the Indonesian people to rely on their hard work and wisdom to continuously create a better future. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China and Indonesia face each other across the sea. The history of the friendly relations between the two countries has a long history. During the long-term exchanges, the people of the two countries jointly wrote a piece of colorful music. As described in the Indonesian folk song ""Beautiful Thoro River"", which is well-known in China, ""Your source is from Thoreau, Wan Chongshan takes you all the way, and the rolling waves flow to the distance and continue to flow into the ocean."" The development of China-Indonesia relations, like the beautiful Thoreau River, rushed across the mountains to the sea and traversed a very extraordinary journey.　　As early as the Han Dynasty of China more than 2000 years ago, the people of the two countries overcame the barrier of the sea and opened the door to exchanges. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, a famous Chinese navigator from the Ming Dynasty, made seven ocean-going trips. Every time he visited the Indonesian archipelago and traveled to Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, etc., leaving many historical stories of friendly exchanges between the two peoples. Recited so far. , 　　 For hundreds of years, the distant and vast sea has not become an obstacle to the exchanges between the two peoples, but has become a friendly bond connecting the two peoples. A fleet full of commodities and passengers of the two countries traveled between them, communicating with each other and conveying friendship. The Chinese classic ""Dream of Red Mansions"" has a vivid description of the rare and precious treasures from Java, while the Indonesian National Museum displays a large number of ancient Chinese porcelains. This is a vivid example of the friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries. The true interpretation of ""neighborhood"". In the historical process of fighting for national independence and liberation in the last century, the two peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other. After the founding of New China, Indonesia was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with China. In 1955, China and Indonesia joined hands with other Asian and African countries to jointly promote the Bandung spirit with peaceful coexistence, seeking common ground while reserving differences at the Bandung Conference. The Bandung spirit is still an important criterion for coexistence between countries, and it has made an indelible historical contribution to the promotion of building a new type of international relations. China and Indonesia achieved resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990 and established a strategic partnership in 2005. The relationship between the two countries has entered a new development period. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 During this visit, I and President Susilo jointly announced the promotion of China-Indonesia relations into a comprehensive strategic partnership, in order to allow the two countries to carry forward and comprehensively develop in depth. , 　　 Now, the mutual trust between our two countries is constantly deepening, and the political foundation of bilateral relations is more solid. The fields of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries are more extensive, ranging from traditional fields such as economy and trade, finance, infrastructure, energy resources, and manufacturing to expanding into emerging fields such as aerospace and maritime. There are real benefits. , 　　 The Surabaya-Madura Bridge, jointly constructed by China and Indonesia, is currently the longest cross-sea bridge in Southeast Asia. The irrigation area of ​​the Gatigudi Dam to be completed in cooperation is 90,000 hectares, which will bring great benefits to the local people’s production and life. Great convenience. The cooperation between China and Indonesia in major international and regional affairs has been continuously strengthened, and the relationship between the two countries has increasingly had regional and global influence, which has contributed to the promotion of international politics.Profit. The cooperation between China and Indonesia in major international and regional affairs has been continuously strengthened, and the relationship between the two countries is increasingly having regional and global influence, which has a positive significance for promoting a more just and reasonable international political and economic order. , 　　 These are the important signs of the friendly relations between China and Indonesia in the new period. , 　　 The people of Indonesia often say: ""Money is easy to get, but friends are hard to find."" The sincere friendship of the people of our two countries is such a precious and precious treasure.　　On December 26, 2004, a strong magnitude 9 earthquake suddenly occurred in the calm Indian Ocean and triggered a large-scale tsunami. Aceh Province of Indonesia suffered heavy loss of life and property, and the world was shocked. After the tsunami, the Chinese government immediately launched an emergency response mechanism. On the same day, it announced that it would provide assistance to the affected countries, including Indonesia, and launched the largest external rescue operation since the founding of New China. In China, from the factory to the airport, the relief supplies are green, and a plane is loaded with the love of the Chinese people to the disaster areas such as Aceh. The China International Rescue Team was the first international rescue team to arrive in Aceh. They rescued more than 10,000 victims in just 13 days. When the local people saw them, many people learned to say in Chinese: ""China, Beijing, I love you."" The Chinese people also spontaneously expressed their condolences and donations to the people in the disaster-stricken areas of Indonesia in various ways. There is an old man in Hangzhou, whose family is not rich. His wife has been hospitalized for a long time. He has just completed the operation, but in order to let the children in the disaster-stricken areas in Indonesia continue to study, he donated 1,000 yuan that he had accumulated. Although there is not much money, it fully reflects the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Indonesian people. , 　　 Similarly, when the Chinese people encountered severe natural disasters, the Indonesian people also extended a helping hand to the Chinese people. On May 12, 2008, a huge earthquake occurred in Wenchuan, China, and people in the disaster areas urgently needed rescue. Indonesia reached out to the Chinese people for the first time and sent a medical team to the disaster area. After arriving in the disaster area, the Indonesian medical team ignored the danger of aftershocks and worked around the clock, treating 260 victims and providing free consultation for 844 residents and 120 students. The members of the Indonesian medical team donated all their money to the disaster area before returning to China. The Indonesian people also donated money and materials to the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area, and some made a special trip to the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to express their wishes and blessings. The actions of the Indonesian people deeply moved the Chinese people. , 　　 Such stories are endless in the friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries, which fully confirms the idiom in both China and Indonesia, which is called ""Common Hardship"". , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China and ASEAN countries are linked by mountains and rivers, and their blood is in line. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership between China and ASEAN. The relationship between China and ASEAN is standing at a new historical starting point. , 　　 China attaches great importance to Indonesia's position and influence in ASEAN, and is willing to work together with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries to make the two sides a good neighbor, good friend, and good partner who will go hand in hand with each other to build a closer China. The ASEAN Community of Destiny brings more well-being to both sides and the people of the region. , 　　 To this end, we must focus on the following aspects of efforts. , 　　 First, insist on faith and harmony. People-to-people communication is about speaking and trusting. Country-to-state relations are based on honesty. China is willing to treat each other with ASEAN countries sincerely and get along with each other, and to continuously consolidate political and strategic mutual trust. , 　　 There is no one-size-fits-all development model in the world, nor is there a set development path. The people of China and ASEAN countries have the courage to reform and innovate, and continue to forge ahead, explore and open up a development path that conforms to the trend of the times and is in line with their own reality, opening up broad prospects for economic and social development. , 　　 We should respect each other’s right to choose their own social system and development path, respect their respective explorations and practices to promote economic and social development and improve people’s lives, strengthen their confidence in each other’s strategic direction, support each other’s major concerns, and firmly grasp The general direction of China-ASEAN strategic cooperation. , 　　 China is willing to negotiate and conclude a good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaty with ASEAN countries, and jointly draw up a beautiful blueprint for good-neighborly friendship. China will, as always, support the development and growth of ASEAN, support the construction of the ASEAN community, and support ASEAN to play a leading role in regional cooperation. , 　　 Second, insist on win-win cooperation. ""Counting profits should count the benefits of the world."" China is willing to expand its opening to ASEAN countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, so that its own development will benefit ASEAN countries better. China is willing to raise the level of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area and strive to bring the trade volume between the two sides to USD 1 trillion in 2020. , 　　 China is committed to strengthening connectivity with ASEAN countries. China proposes to establish an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and is willing to support developing countries in the region, including ASEAN countries, in the construction of infrastructure connectivity. ,. China proposes to establish an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and is willing to support developing countries in the region, including ASEAN countries, in the construction of infrastructure connectivity. , 　　 Southeast Asia has been an important hub of the “Maritime Silk Road” since ancient times. China is willing to strengthen maritime cooperation with ASEAN countries, make good use of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund established by the Chinese government, develop maritime cooperative partnership, and jointly build the 21st century.” Maritime Silk Road"". China is willing to expand practical cooperation with ASEAN countries in various fields, to communicate with each other and to complement each other's advantages, share opportunities and meet challenges with ASEAN countries, and achieve common development and common prosperity. , 　　Third, insist on helping each other. China and ASEAN countries are closely interdependent and shoulder the responsibility of jointly maintaining regional peace and stability. Historically, the people of China and ASEAN countries have fought side by side in the struggle to control the destiny of the nation. In recent years, from responding to the Asian financial crisis to responding to the international financial crisis, from combating the Indian Ocean tsunami to combating the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan, China, our peoples have formed a strong synergy shoulder to shoulder and holding hands. , 　　 We should abandon the Cold War mentality, actively advocate new concepts of comprehensive security, common security, and cooperative security, and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability. We should deepen cooperation in disaster prevention and relief, cybersecurity, combating transnational crimes, and joint law enforcement to create a more peaceful, peaceful, and warm regional home for the people in the region. , 　　 China is willing to further improve the China-ASEAN defense ministers meeting mechanism with ASEAN countries and hold regular dialogues on regional security issues. , 　　 With regard to the differences and disputes between China and some Southeast Asian countries in terms of territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, the two sides must always adhere to peaceful means, handle them properly through equal dialogue and friendly consultations, and maintain the overall situation of bilateral relations and regional stability. , 　　 Fourth, stick to the heart. ""The wood of the embrace is born at the end; the nine-story platform starts from tired soil."" To maintain the evergreen tree of China-ASEAN friendship, it is necessary to strengthen the social soil of bilateral relations. Last year, there were 15 million person-to-person exchanges between China and ASEAN countries, and more than 1,000 flights a week traveled between China and ASEAN countries. With more contacts and deeper feelings, the heart and heart can be closer. , 　　 We want to promote friendly exchanges among youth, think tanks, parliaments, non-governmental organizations, social groups, etc., provide more intellectual support for the development of China-ASEAN relations, and enhance people's understanding and friendship. China is willing to send more volunteers to ASEAN to support the development of cultural, educational, health, medical and other fields in ASEAN countries. China proposes to determine 2014 as the China-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year. In the next three to five years, China will provide 15,000 government scholarships to ASEAN countries. , 　　 Fifth, insist on openness and tolerance. ""Hundreds of rivers and rivers, capacity is great."" In the long historical process, the people of China and ASEAN countries have created a colorful and world-renowned splendid civilization. This is a region full of diversity. Various civilizations have merged and evolved through mutual influence, providing an important cultural foundation for the people of China and ASEAN countries to learn from each other, learn from each other, and promote each other. , 　　 We should actively learn from the development experience of other regions, and welcome countries outside the region to play a constructive role in the development and stability of the region. At the same time, countries outside the region should also respect the diversity of the region and do more things that are conducive to the development and stability of the region. The China-ASEAN Community of Destiny is closely related to the ASEAN Community and the East Asian Community. It should exert its respective advantages to realize multi-symbiosis, inclusiveness and common progress, and benefit the people of this region and the peoples of the world.　　A closer China-ASEAN community of shared destiny is in line with the trend of the times seeking peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and is in the common interest of people in Asia and the world. It has broad development space and huge development potential. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 60 years after the founding of New China, especially over 30 years of reform and opening up, China has embarked on a successful development path and achieved world-renowned development achievements. China has made strategic arrangements for its future development and made clear its goal of striving to achieve GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents double by 2020 compared with 2010, and to build a well-off society in an all-round way; to build a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious society by the middle of this century A modern socialist country realizes the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This is a century-old long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and it is also a necessary condition for China to make greater contributions to mankind. , 　　 ""Contribute to merits and dedicate to careers, broad industry and diligence."" We are confident, qualified and capable of achieving our goal of struggle. At the same time, we are soberly aware that China is still the largest developing country in the world. We still face many difficulties and challenges on the way forward. To make all Chinese people live a better life, we need to make long-term and unremitting efforts . We will stick to reform and opening upShanghai still faces many difficulties and challenges. To enable all Chinese people to lead a better life, it takes long and unremitting efforts. We will insist on unshakable reform and opening up, adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, concentrate on doing our business well, continue to promote modernization, and continuously improve people's living standards. , 　　 China's development is inseparable from the world, and the world's development also requires China. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, and unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results. China's development is the growth of world peace forces, the positive energy to convey friendship, and development opportunities rather than threats to Asia and the world. China is willing to continue to share economic and social development opportunities with ASEAN, Asia and the world. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 At present, the Chinese people are committed to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the Indonesian people are also actively promoting the overall plan for economic development and seeking the rise of the nation. In order to realize our respective dreams, both sides need mutual understanding, mutual support, and cooperation, as well as the participation of people of insight from both countries to work hard and work hard. , 　　 Speaking of this, I remembered a song composed by President Susilo called ""Tranquility"". It was October 2006 when President Susilo came to Guangxi, China, to attend the 15th anniversary commemorative summit on the establishment of China-ASEAN dialogue relations. During the meeting, he produced creative inspiration on the Li River and wrote a beautiful lyrics: ""Happy days, continuous circulation in life, I and my partners spent the good time together."" President Susilo Touching the scenery between China's mountains and rivers, and thinking of their childhood and their hometowns, shows that our two peoples have similar hearts and similar feelings. , 　　 country's friendship lies in blind date. It is with such friendly messengers that they have built bridges of friendship and opened a window of soul, so that the friendship between our two peoples can cross the long river of history and the vast ocean. . , 　　Youth is the most energetic and full of dreams, youth is strong and the country is strong, and youth is strong and the country is strong. Young people represent the future and hope of exchanges between the two countries. President Susilo and I have unanimously agreed that the two countries will expand and deepen cultural exchanges. Over the next five years, the two sides will exchange 100 young people each year to visit each other's countries, and China will provide 1,000 scholarships to Indonesia. , 　　 I believe that as more and more young people join the tide of friendship between China and Indonesia, the cause of friendly exchanges between the two countries will be handed down and prosperous. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends!　　 China and Indonesia have a population of 1.6 billion. As long as the people of our two countries join hands and join hands, they will bring together a huge force of a quarter of the world's population and create new miracles in the history of human development. The Chinese people and the Indonesian people should work together to write a new chapter in the development of relations between the two countries, create a bright future for China-ASEAN community with a shared future, and make greater contributions to the noble cause of world peace and development. , 　　 Delhi Magasi!

　　２０年前，我曾访问过贵国，亲身体验了印度尼西亚发展情况以及丰富多彩的自然和文化。２０年弹指一挥间，但那时的场景仿佛就发生在昨天，依然历历在目。再次踏上这片美丽的土地，我更加深切地感受到两国关系的旺盛活力，更加深切地体会到两国人民的深情厚谊。, 　　近年来，在苏西洛总统领导下，印度尼西亚人民团结一心、奋发努力，开创出经济发展、社会稳定、国力蒸蒸日上的良好局面。我衷心祝愿印度尼西亚人民依靠自己的勤劳和智慧，不断创造更加美好的未来。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国和印度尼西亚隔海相望，两国友好关系的历史源远流长，在长期交往的过程中，两国人民共同谱写了一曲曲交流交融的华彩乐章。正如在中国家喻户晓的印度尼西亚民歌《美丽的梭罗河》所描述的那样：“你的源泉来自梭罗，万重山送你一路前往，滚滚的波涛流向远方，一直流入海洋”。中国和印尼关系发展，如同美丽的梭罗河一样，越过重重山峦奔流向海，走过了很不平凡的历程。, 　　早在２０００多年前的中国汉代，两国人民就克服大海的阻隔，打开了往来的大门。１５世纪初，中国明代著名航海家郑和七次远洋航海，每次都到访印尼群岛，足迹遍及爪哇、苏门答腊、加里曼丹等地，留下了两国人民友好交往的历史佳话，许多都传诵至今。, 　　几百年来，遥远浩瀚的大海没有成为两国人民交往的阻碍，反而成为连接两国人民的友好纽带。满载着两国商品和旅客的船队往来其间，互通有无，传递情谊。中国古典名著《红楼梦》对来自爪哇的奇珍异宝有着形象描述，而印度尼西亚国家博物馆则陈列了大量中国古代瓷器，这是两国人民友好交往的生动例证，是对“海内存知己，天涯若比邻”的真实诠释。, 　　在上世纪争取民族独立和解放的历史进程中，两国人民始终相互同情、相互支持。新中国成立后，印度尼西亚是最早同中国建交的国家之一。１９５５年，中国和印尼两国同其他亚非国家携手合作，在万隆会议上共同倡导了以和平共处、求同存异为核心的万隆精神。万隆精神至今仍是国与国相处的重要准则，为推动建设新型国际关系作出了不可磨灭的历史贡献。中国和印尼两国１９９０年实现复交、２００５年建立战略伙伴关系，两国关系由此进入新的发展时期。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　这次访问期间，我同苏西洛总统共同宣布将中国和印尼关系提升为全面战略伙伴关系，为的是让两国关系继往开来、全面深入发展。, 　　现在，我们两国互信不断加深，双边关系政治基础更加牢固。两国务实合作领域更加广泛，既有经贸、金融、基础设施、能源资源、制造业等传统领域，还拓展到航天、海上等新兴领域，可谓“上天”、“入海”，给两国人民带来了实实在在的利益。, 　　中国和印尼共同建设的泗水—马都拉大桥，是目前东南亚最长的跨海大桥，即将合作完成的加蒂格迪大坝灌溉面积达９万公顷，将给当地民众生产生活带来极大便利。中国和印尼在重大国际和地区事务中的合作不断加强，两国关系越来越具有地区和全球影响，对推动国际政治经济秩序更加公正合理具有积极意义。, 　　这些都堪称新时期中国和印尼友好关系的重要标志。, 　　印度尼西亚人民常讲：“金钱易得，朋友难求。”我们两国人民的真挚情谊，就是这种千金难求的宝贵财富。, 　　２００４年１２月２６日，平静的印度洋骤然发生９级强震，并引发了大规模海啸，印度尼西亚亚齐省遭受重大生命财产损失，世界为之震惊。海啸发生后，中国政府立即启动应急机制，当天就宣布向包括印尼在内的受灾国提供援助，开展了新中国成立以来最大规模的一次对外救援行动。在中国，从工厂到机场，救援物资一路绿灯，一架架飞机满载着中国人民的爱心飞往亚齐等灾区。中国国际救援队是第一支抵达亚齐的国际救援队，他们在短短１３天里救治了１万多名受灾群众。当地群众见到他们，不少人学会了用汉语说：“中国，北京，我爱你。”, 　　中国民众也自发以各种方式对印尼灾区人民表达慰问、提供捐助。杭州市有一位老人，自身家境并不富裕，老伴患病长期住院，他本人也刚做完手术，但为了让印尼灾区孩子继续读书，他捐出了辛苦积攒下来的１０００元人民币。钱虽不多，但充分体现了中国人民对印尼人民的一片深情厚谊。, 　　同样，在中国人民遇到严重自然灾害时，印尼人民也向中国人民伸出了援助之手。２００８年５月１２日，中国汶川发生特大地震，灾区人民急需救援。印尼第一时间向中国人民伸出了援手，派出医疗队赶赴灾区。印尼医疗队抵达灾区后，不顾灾后余震的危险，夜以继日工作，诊治了２６０名灾民，为８４４名居民和１２０名学生提供了义诊。印尼医疗队队员在回国前把身上所有钱物全部捐给了灾区。印尼人民也自发为汶川地震灾区捐款捐物，有的专程来到中国驻印尼大使馆，表达他们的祈愿和祝福。印尼民众的举动让中国人民深受感动。, 　　这样的故事，在两国人民友好交往中数不胜数，充分印证了中国和印尼都有的一句成语，叫“患难与共”。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国和东盟国家山水相连、血脉相亲。今年是中国和东盟建立战略伙伴关系１０周年，中国和东盟关系正站在新的历史起点上。, 　　中方高度重视印尼在东盟的地位和影响，愿同印尼和其他东盟国家共同努力，使双方成为兴衰相伴、安危与共、同舟共济的好邻居、好朋友、好伙伴，携手建设更为紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体，为双方和本地区人民带来更多福祉。, 　　为此，我们要着重从以下几个方面作出努力。, 　　第一，坚持讲信修睦。人与人交往在于言而有信，国与国相处讲究诚信为本。中国愿同东盟国家真诚相待、友好相处，不断巩固政治和战略互信。, 　　世界上没有放之四海而皆准的发展模式，也没有一成不变的发展道路。中国和东盟国家人民勇于变革创新，不断开拓进取，探索和开辟顺应时代潮流、符合自身实际的发展道路，为经济社会发展打开了广阔前景。, 　　我们应该尊重彼此自主选择社会制度和发展道路的权利，尊重各自推动经济社会发展、改善人民生活的探索和实践，坚定对对方战略走向的信心，在对方重大关切问题上相互支持，牢牢把握中国—东盟战略合作的大方向。, 　　中国愿同东盟国家商谈缔结睦邻友好合作条约，共同绘就睦邻友好的美好蓝图。中国将一如既往支持东盟发展壮大，支持东盟共同体建设，支持东盟在区域合作中发挥主导作用。, 　　第二，坚持合作共赢。“计利当计天下利。”中国愿在平等互利的基础上，扩大对东盟国家开放，使自身发展更好惠及东盟国家。中国愿提高中国—东盟自由贸易区水平，争取使２０２０年双方贸易额达到１万亿美元。, 　　中国致力于加强同东盟国家的互联互通建设。中国倡议筹建亚洲基础设施投资银行，愿支持本地区发展中国家包括东盟国家开展基础设施互联互通建设。, 　　东南亚地区自古以来就是“海上丝绸之路”的重要枢纽，中国愿同东盟国家加强海上合作，使用好中国政府设立的中国—东盟海上合作基金，发展好海洋合作伙伴关系，共同建设２１世纪“海上丝绸之路”。中国愿通过扩大同东盟国家各领域务实合作，互通有无、优势互补，同东盟国家共享机遇、共迎挑战，实现共同发展、共同繁荣。, 　　第三，坚持守望相助。中国和东盟国家唇齿相依，肩负着共同维护地区和平稳定的责任。历史上，中国和东盟国家人民在掌握民族命运的斗争中曾经并肩战斗、风雨同舟。近年来，从应对亚洲金融危机到应对国际金融危机，从抗击印度洋海啸到抗击中国汶川特大地震灾害，我们各国人民肩并着肩、手挽着手，形成了强大合力。, 　　我们应该摒弃冷战思维，积极倡导综合安全、共同安全、合作安全的新理念，共同维护本地区和平稳定。我们应该深化在防灾救灾、网络安全、打击跨国犯罪、联合执法等方面的合作，为本地区人民营造更加和平、更加安宁、更加温馨的地区家园。, 　　中国愿同东盟国家进一步完善中国—东盟防长会议机制，就地区安全问题定期举行对话。, 　　对中国和一些东南亚国家在领土主权和海洋权益方面存在的分歧和争议，双方要始终坚持以和平方式，通过平等对话和友好协商妥善处理，维护双方关系和地区稳定大局。, 　　第四，坚持心心相印。“合抱之木，生于毫末；九层之台，起于累土”。保持中国—东盟友谊之树长青，必须夯实双方关系的社会土壤。去年，中国和东盟国家人员往来达１５００万人次，每周有１０００多个航班往返于中国和东盟国家之间。交往多了，感情深了，心与心才能贴得更近。, 　　我们要促进青年、智库、议会、非政府组织、社会团体等的友好交流，为中国—东盟关系发展提供更多智力支撑，增进人民了解和友谊。中国愿向东盟派出更多志愿者，支持东盟国家文化、教育、卫生、医疗等领域事业发展。中国倡议将２０１４年确定为中国—东盟文化交流年。今后３到５年，中国将向东盟国家提供１．５万个政府奖学金名额。, 　　第五，坚持开放包容。“海纳百川，有容乃大。”在漫长历史进程中，中国和东盟国家人民创造了丰富多彩、享誉世界的辉煌文明。这里是充满多样性的区域，各种文明在相互影响中融合演进，为中国和东盟国家人民相互学习、相互借鉴、相互促进提供了重要文化基础。, 　　我们要积极借鉴其他地区发展经验，欢迎域外国家为本地区发展稳定发挥建设性作用。同时，域外国家也应该尊重本地区的多样性，多做有利于本地区发展稳定的事情。中国—东盟命运共同体和东盟共同体、东亚共同体息息相关，应发挥各自优势，实现多元共生、包容共进，共同造福于本地区人民和世界各国人民。, 　　一个更加紧密的中国—东盟命运共同体，符合求和平、谋发展、促合作、图共赢的时代潮流，符合亚洲和世界各国人民共同利益，具有广阔发展空间和巨大发展潜力。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　新中国成立６０多年来特别是改革开放３０多年来，中国走出了一条成功的发展道路，取得了举世瞩目的发展成就。中国对未来发展作出了战略部署，明确了奋斗目标，即到２０２０年实现国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入比２０１０年翻一番，全面建成小康社会；到本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴。这是中华民族和中国人民的百年夙愿，也是中国为人类作出更大贡献的必要条件。, 　　“功崇惟志，业广惟勤。”我们有信心、有条件、有能力实现我们的奋斗目标。同时，我们也清醒地认识到，中国仍是世界上最大的发展中国家，我们在前进道路上仍然面临不少困难和挑战，要使全体中国人民都过上美好生活，需要付出长期不懈的努力。我们将坚持改革开放不动摇，坚持走中国特色社会主义道路，集中精力把自己的事情办好，不断推进现代化建设，不断提高人民生活水平。, 　　中国的发展离不开世界，世界的发展也需要中国。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，坚定不移奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚定不移奉行互利共赢的开放战略。中国的发展，是世界和平力量的壮大，是传递友谊的正能量，为亚洲和世界带来的是发展机遇而不是威胁。中国愿继续同东盟、同亚洲、同世界分享经济社会发展的机遇。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　当前，中国人民正致力于实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，印尼人民也在积极推进经济发展总体规划、谋求民族崛起。为实现我们各自的梦想，双方更需要相互理解、相互支持、携手合作，更需要两国有识之士参与其中，脚踏实地去耕耘、去努力。, 　　说到这里，我想起了苏西洛总统创作的一首歌，名字叫《宁静》。那是２００６年１０月，苏西洛总统来到中国广西出席中国—东盟建立对话关系１５周年纪念峰会。会议间隙，他在漓江上产生了创作灵感，提笔写下了一首优美的歌词：“快乐的日子，在生命中不断循环，我与伙伴，共同度过那美好时光。”苏西洛总统在中国的山水之间触景生情，想起自己的童年、自己的家乡，说明我们两国人民是心相通、情相近的。, 　　国之交在于民相亲。正是有了这样一个个友好使者，架起了一座座友谊桥梁，打开了一扇扇心灵之窗，我们两国人民友谊才得以穿过历史长河、跨越浩瀚大海，历久弥坚，历久弥新。, 　　青年最富有朝气、最富有梦想，青年兴则国家兴，青年强则国家强。青年代表着两国交往的未来和希望。我和苏西洛总统一致同意，两国将扩大并深化人文交流，今后５年，双方将每年互派１００名青年访问对方国家，中国将向印尼提供１０００个奖学金名额。, 　　我相信，随着越来越多的青年人投身到中国和印尼友好的大潮当中，两国友好交往事业一定会薪火相传、兴旺发达。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国和印尼两国有１６亿人口，只要我们两国人民手拉手、心连心，就将汇聚起世界四分之一人口的巨大力量，就可以创造人类发展史上新的奇迹。中国人民和印尼人民要携手努力，共同谱写两国关系发展的崭新篇章，开创中国—东盟命运共同体的美好未来，共同为世界和平与发展的崇高事业作出更大贡献。, 　　德里马嘎西！（谢谢！）, 　　（新华社雅加达１０月３日电）  , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2013年10月04日

12,156,"[, 　　On the eve of a state visit to Indonesia and Malaysia and attending the 21st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, President Xi Jinping accepted the Indonesian Jakarta Post, The Compass, the Malaysian Malaysian Frontier, A joint interview with ""Sin Chew Daily"" and ""New Straits Times"", expounded on the bilateral relations between China and the two countries, the 21st APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, the economic prospects in Asia-Pacific, China's economic situation, and China-ASEAN relations, etc. Views and opinions. The full text is as follows:, 　　 Question: We have noticed that Indonesia will be your first stop on your first visit to Southeast Asia after serving as the Chinese President. What are your expectations for this visit? The Chinese and Indonesian national football teams will hold the 2015 Asian Cup qualifiers in Jakarta in mid-October. I heard that you are a football fan, please predict the outcome of the game. , 　　 Answer: Indonesia is a beautiful country, known as ""the emerald on the equator"". Indonesian folk songs such as ""Ouch Mom"" ​​and ""Stars"" are widely sung in China. I visited Indonesia 20 years ago. At that time, Indonesia was one of the ""Four Asian Tigers"", and its development scene left a deep impression on me. Since the end of the last century, Indonesia has successively overcome the impact of the Asian financial crisis and the international economic and financial crisis, and achieved political stability, economic development, social progress, and national harmony. It has become an emerging market economy that has attracted worldwide attention.　　It has been 63 years since China and Indonesia established diplomatic relations, and the relationship between the two countries has gone through an extraordinary course. In the new century, especially since the establishment of strategic partnership between China and Indonesia in 2005, dialogue and cooperation in various fields between the two countries have ushered in a new period of comprehensive and rapid development. From 2005 to 2012, the two countries established multi-level and multi-field cooperation mechanisms such as deputy prime minister-level dialogues, defense consultations, and maritime cooperation. Last year, the bilateral trade volume reached US$66.2 billion, which was four times that of 2005; China’s direct investment in Indonesia increased tenfold to US$2 billion; and personnel exchanges increased threefold to 1.33 million. The two sides have cooperated closely in regional and international affairs, effectively safeguarding the common interests of the vast number of developing countries. , 　　 Both China and Indonesia are major developing countries in the region. The strategic cooperation between the two countries is of great significance and broad prospects. My state visit to Indonesia is both a journey of inheriting friendly relations and a journey of planning cooperation. I look forward to in-depth exchange of views with President Susilo on comprehensively promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries and pushing China-Indonesia relations to a higher level. , 　　Football is a team sport that pays attention to cooperation. Personal ability is important, but teamwork is the key to determine the result of the game. This is one of the reasons why I love football. The charm of football also lies in the fact that the situation on the court changes rapidly, and the ending is unpredictable. I hope that the Chinese national team and the Indonesian national team will bring you a pleasing, friendly and exciting game. I also hope that both teams will qualify for the World Cup finals in the near future. , 　　 Question: Both China and Malaysia have established a new government this year. How do you evaluate the current China-Malaysia relations? What do you expect from the future development of bilateral relations? , 　　 Answer: In recent years, China-Malaysia relations have made great progress and entered a comprehensive, stable and pragmatic development track. China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner for four consecutive years, and Malaysia has been China’s largest trading partner in ASEAN for five consecutive years. In 2012, the bilateral trade volume between China and Malaysia reached a record high of US$94.8 billion. Malaysia is expected to become the third Asian country whose bilateral trade volume with China has exceeded US$100 billion after Japan and South Korea. China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park and Mazhong Kuantan Industrial Park have been launched one after another, creating a precedent for China and ASEAN countries to establish national industrial parks. The rapid development of financial cooperation between China and Malaysia has signed a bilateral local currency swap agreement with an amount of 180 billion yuan, which provides a strong guarantee for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. Humanities exchanges between the two countries have continued to expand, with personnel exchanges surpassing 2 million person-times for three consecutive years. Currently, the total number of exchange students between China and Malaysia exceeds 15,000. China-Malaysia cooperation has achieved mutual benefit and win-win results. , 　　 At present, both China and Malaysia are committed to improving people's lives and achieving national development. China is willing to cooperate with Malaysia to create a better future. I look forward to in-depth discussions with Malaysian leaders on the promotion of all-round cooperation to build a stable framework for the long-term and healthy development of bilateral relations. It is believed that with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Malaysia strategic cooperation will continue to reach a new level and better benefit the peoples of the two countries. Q: Q: The 21st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting will be held in Bali, Indonesia from October 7th to 8th. What do you expect from the outcome of this meeting? China will host APEC next year, can you briefly introduce China’sHeld in Bali. What do you expect from the outcome of this meeting? China will host the APEC next year. Could you briefly introduce China's consideration of holding a meeting next year? , 　　 Answer: At present, the world economy has entered a period of in-depth adjustment, and the development of all regions is facing opportunities and challenges. The Asia-Pacific region plays a leading role in promoting the global economic recovery and is still the region with the most development vitality and potential in the world. As the highest level, widest field and most influential economic cooperation organization in the Asia-Pacific region, APEC has played an important role in promoting exchanges and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and promoting regional economic integration. , 　　 China hopes that the 21st APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting held in Bali, Indonesia will promote Asia-Pacific’s leading role in the global economic recovery, and strive to achieve three goals: First, the international community’s commitment to Asia-Pacific development The second is to give full play to APEC’s leading and coordinating role and enhance APEC’s status. The third is to promote the conference to achieve positive and practical results in the fields of supporting the multilateral trading system, coordinating regional free trade arrangements, and promoting Asia-Pacific interconnection and infrastructure construction. , 　　 China will host the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders’ Informal Meeting next year, and we hope to use this as an opportunity to promote Asia-Pacific economies to build closer partnerships and promote APEC cooperation based on the concept of openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. The organization plays a greater leading role, promotes the integrated development of the Asia-Pacific region, outlines the long-term development vision of the Asia-Pacific region, and seeks a win-win cooperation; strengthens the coordination of macroeconomic policies among Asia-Pacific members, strengthens the notification and exchange of regional free trade arrangements, and promotes the integration of regional economies Promote transformation and growth, strengthen innovation and development, seek growth during transformation, use growth to help transformation, and inject greater impetus and vitality into Asia-Pacific development; continue to vigorously promote the construction of all-round infrastructure and interconnection, and strive to solve outstanding problems through Connectivity and close regional and subregional cooperation to build an economic pattern that is consistent with the direction of Asia-Pacific integration.　　 China is willing to communicate closely with all parties to jointly hold the APEC meetings this year and next year and make greater contributions to the development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. , 　　 Question: Recently, the financial markets of some Asia-Pacific emerging market economies have fluctuated and the uncertainties facing economic growth have increased. At the same time, China's economic growth has slowed. The international community's worries about Asia-Pacific economic prospects and China's economic slowdown have risen. What is your opinion on this? , 　　 Answer: Recently, the financial markets of some Asia-Pacific emerging market economies have fluctuated. The main reason is that external factors have influenced market expectations, leading to the withdrawal of international capital. We call on major developed economies to adopt responsible macroeconomic policies to avoid negative spillover effects. At the same time, emerging market economies should also enhance their risk prevention awareness and improve their ability to resist risks. It should be emphasized that the common desire of the Asia-Pacific region for peace, stability and development has not changed, the historical trend of the Asia-Pacific region’s rising position and role in the world’s political and economic territory has not changed, and the momentum and potential for sustained economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region have not changed. change. , 　　 We have reason to believe that the development prospects of the Asia-Pacific region are bright. APEC members should promote the Asia-Pacific region to continue to play a leading role in the overall recovery and healthy growth of the world economy. , 　　 In the first half of this year, China's economy grew by 7.6% year-on-year, slowing down from the previous growth rate. This is the result of China's active regulation. We are determined to stabilize growth, adjust structure, and promote reform. We no longer simply use GDP as a hero, but take the quality and efficiency of economic growth as the foothold. Today's adjustment and transformation is for tomorrow's healthier, higher quality and more sustainable growth. Relatively speaking, China's economic growth is not slow, and it still ranks among the best in the Asia-Pacific region and even the world. China is fully confident of achieving sustained and healthy economic development. The sustained and healthy development of the Chinese economy will inject new impetus into the global economic recovery and make greater contributions to the common development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. Q: At present, the process of Asia-Pacific economic integration is developing in depth, and regional free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are constantly emerging. What is your opinion on Asia-Pacific economic integration? What role can APEC play? , 　　 Answer: Asia-Pacific economic integration has outlined the beautiful vision of regional economic integration and the in-depth development of Asia-Pacific cooperation. This is the common mission of APEC members and a grand goal for the future development of Asia-Pacific. , 　　 At present, various free trade arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region are constantly emerging. This is a positive development for the in-depth development of regional integration. We should expand market openings and deepen regional economic integration through the development of regional free trade arrangements. ,   ""Be tolerant to diversity, tolerance is a virtue"". China has always actively supported and participated in the process of economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Be tolerant to diversity, tolerance is a virtue"". China has always actively supported and participated in the Asia-Pacific economic integration process, and is open to any institutional arrangements conducive to advancing the Asia-Pacific regional integration process. At the same time, we believe that all parties must uphold the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency when carrying out the construction of free trade zones, especially to show flexibility to economies with different levels of development, so that economies have more choices on the path of integration . , 　　 As the highest-level, widest-ranging and most influential economic cooperation organization in the Asia-Pacific region, APEC should play a leading and coordinating role in promoting the exchange of information, transparency and openness of trade arrangements, so that they can learn from each other Promote, form a situation of integration and complementarity with each other, and create favorable conditions for the ultimate realization of Asia-Pacific economic integration. , 　　 Question: This year marks the 10th anniversary of China-ASEAN strategic partnership. In the past 10 years, the relationship between the two sides has made great progress. All circles are very concerned about the future development of China-ASEAN relations, including how to deal with the South China Sea issue. What do you think of the prospects for China-ASEAN relations in the next 10 years? , 　　 Answer: China and ASEAN countries are connected by mountains and rivers, and they are in close blood, just like a big family. The friendly exchanges between the two sides have a long history. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership between China and ASEAN. Looking back at the development of China-ASEAN relations over the past 10 years, mutual respect, equal treatment, good-neighborliness and friendship, and mutual benefit and win-win situation have continued throughout the development of bilateral relations. China-ASEAN relations have surpassed the bilateral scope, have important regional and global significance, and become the cornerstone of prosperity and stability in East Asia. , 　　 China adheres to the neighboring diplomatic policy of doing good to its neighbors and partnering with its neighbors, and will strive to make its own development better benefit its neighbors. We will unswervingly take ASEAN as the priority of diplomacy in the periphery, unswervingly deepen the strategic partnership with ASEAN, unswervingly work with ASEAN to maintain peace and stability in the region, including the South China Sea. Regarding some differences and contradictions between countries, China has always advocated proper settlement through friendly consultation and dialogue, and will make unremitting efforts to this end. China will, as always, support the development and growth of ASEAN, the construction of the ASEAN community, and ASEAN's leading position in East Asian cooperation.　　As an emerging market country in Asia, China and ASEAN are not only linked to their destiny, but also the hope of sustained economic growth in the region and the world. Both China and ASEAN are developing economies. The most important tasks we face are to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. The cooperation between China and ASEAN will not only provide vast space and endless business opportunities for the development of our respective countries, but also make greater contributions to world prosperity and stability. , 　　 China-ASEAN relations have huge potential for development and room for expansion. In the coming period, the two sides must grasp several things. First, maintain high-level exchanges, strengthen strategic communication, and continuously increase mutual trust. The second is to raise the level of China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, further open markets to each other, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. The third is to promote interconnection, establish an Asian infrastructure investment and financing platform, and solve bottlenecks. The fourth is to give full play to the role of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund and develop practical maritime cooperation. Fifth, deepen cooperation in the field of defense and security, improve the defense mechanism meeting between the two sides, actively promote exchanges and cooperation between law enforcement and security departments, and jointly safeguard the region and peace. Sixth, close non-governmental exchanges at all levels, especially people-to-people exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and strengthen the public and social foundations of China-ASEAN good-neighborly and friendly relations. Seventh, strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional affairs, jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries, and promote the democratization of international relations. , 　　 Question: ASEAN countries hope that China will adhere to the path of peaceful development and hope that the Chinese dream will complement the dreams of other countries in pursuing a better life and realizing national development. What do you think about this? , 　　 Answer: For thousands of years, the Chinese nation has formed the concept of loving both non-offensive, pro-neighborly and good-neighborly, taking harmony as the most valuable and different from each other. China adheres to the neighboring diplomatic policy of being good neighbors and neighbors, and has made important contributions to the prosperity and stability of Asia. At present, with the continuous development of economic globalization and regional economic integration, Asia has become an important engine of world economic growth. Maintaining stability and development in Asia is in the interest of Asian countries, including China. The destiny of China has been closely linked to the destiny of Asian countries. , 　　 At present, the Chinese people are working hard to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Our goal is to build a well-off society in an all-round way when the Communist Party of China is 100 years old, and to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modernized country when it is 100 years old. To achieve these goals, China needs a peaceful and stable surrounding environment.　　Taking the path of peaceful development is an inevitable choice made by the Chinese nation from its own fundamental interests and long-term interests. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and will neverThe path of development is an inevitable choice made by the Chinese nation from its own fundamental interests and long-term interests.

China is willing to work hand in hand with each other on the road to the realization of ideals, heart and soul, mutual help, give play to their respective advantages, and tap the potential for cooperation. To achieve mutual benefit and win-win. , 　　 ""People's Daily"" (October 03, 2013 02 edition),]",President Xi Jinping interviewed by Indonesian and Malaysian media,4629,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-10-03,"[, 　　在对印度尼西亚、马来西亚进行国事访问并出席亚太经合组织第二十一次领导人非正式会议前夕，国家主席习近平接受了印度尼西亚《雅加达邮报》、《罗盘报》，马来西亚《马来西亚前锋报》、《星洲日报》、《新海峡时报》联合采访，就中国同两国双边关系、亚太经合组织第二十一次领导人非正式会议、亚太经济前景、中国经济形势、中国同东盟关系等阐述了看法和主张。全文如下：, 　　问：我们注意到，印尼将成为您担任中国国家主席后首访东南亚的第一站，您对此访有何期待？中国和印尼国家足球队10月中旬将在雅加达举行2015年亚洲杯预选赛。听说您是一名足球迷，请您预测一下比赛结果。, 　　答：印尼是一个美丽的国家，被誉为“赤道上的翡翠”。《哎哟妈妈》、《星星索》等印尼民歌在中国广为传唱。20年前我曾到访过印尼。当时印尼是“亚洲四小虎”之一，其发展景象给我留下深刻印象。, 　　上世纪末以来，印尼先后克服亚洲金融危机和国际经济金融危机冲击，实现政治稳定、经济发展、社会进步、民族和睦，成为世人瞩目的新兴市场经济体。, 　　中国和印尼建交已有63年，两国关系走过了不平凡的历程。进入新世纪，特别是2005年中印尼建立战略伙伴关系以来，两国各领域对话和合作迎来了全面快速发展的新时期。2005年至2012年，两国建立了副总理级对话、防务磋商、海上合作等多层级、多领域合作机制。去年双边贸易额达662亿美元，是2005年的4倍；中方对印尼直接投资增长10倍，达到20亿美元；人员往来增长3倍，达到133万人次。双方在地区和国际事务中密切配合，有力维护了广大发展中国家共同利益。, 　　中国和印尼都是本地区发展中大国。两国开展战略合作意义重大、前景广阔。我这次对印尼的国事访问既是传承友好关系之旅，也是规划合作之旅。我期待着同苏西洛总统就全面推进两国友好合作深入交换意见，推动中印尼关系向更高水平迈进。, 　　足球是一项讲究配合的集体运动，个人能力固然重要，但团队合作才是决定比赛结果的关键。这是我爱好足球运动的原因之一。足球的魅力还在于赛场情况瞬息万变，结局不可预测。我希望中国国家队和印尼国家队能为大家带来一场赏心悦目、友好精彩的比赛。我也希望两队都能在不远的将来跻身世界杯决赛圈。, 　　问：中国和马来西亚都在今年成立了新一届政府。您如何评价当前的中马关系？您对两国关系未来发展有何期待？, 　　答：近年来，中马关系得到长足发展，步入全面、稳定、务实发展轨道。中国连续4年成为马来西亚最大贸易伙伴，马来西亚连续5年成为中国在东盟的最大贸易伙伴。2012年，中马双边贸易额创下948亿美元历史新高，马来西亚有望成为继日本、韩国之后同中国双边贸易额突破千亿美元的第三个亚洲国家。中马钦州产业园区和马中关丹产业园区相继启动，开创了中国同东盟国家互设国家级产业园区的先河。中马金融合作快速发展，签署了数额为1800亿元人民币的双边本币互换协议，为两国经贸合作提供了有力保障。两国人文交流不断扩大，人员往来连续3年超过200万人次，目前中马两国互派留学生总数超过15000人次。中马合作实现了互利双赢。, 　　当前，中马两国都致力于改善人民生活，实现国家发展。中方愿同马方携手合作，共创美好未来。我期待着同马来西亚领导人就推进全方位合作进行深入探讨，为两国关系长期健康发展构建稳定框架。相信在双方共同努力下，中马战略性合作将不断迈上新台阶，更好造福两国人民。, 　　问：亚太经合组织第二十一次领导人非正式会议将于10月7日至8日在印尼巴厘岛举行。您对这次会议成果有何期待？中国将担任明年亚太经合组织东道主，您能否简要介绍中方对明年办会的考虑？, 　　答：当前，世界经济进入深度调整期，各地区发展均面临机遇和挑战。亚太地区在推动全球经济复苏中发挥引领作用，仍是世界上最具发展活力和潜力的地区。亚太经合组织作为亚太地区层级最高、领域最广、最具影响力的经济合作组织，在推动亚太交流合作、促进区域经济一体化等方面发挥了重要作用。, 　　中方希望，在印尼巴厘岛举行的亚太经合组织第二十一次领导人非正式会议以推动亚太在全球经济复苏中发挥引领作用为主线，争取实现3个目标：一是坚定国际社会对亚太发展的信心；二是发挥亚太经合组织引领和协调作用，提升亚太经合组织地位；三是推动会议在支持多边贸易体制、协调区域自由贸易安排、推动亚太互联互通和基础设施建设等领域取得积极务实成果。, 　　中国将于明年主办亚太经合组织第二十二次领导人非正式会议，我们希望以此为契机，推动亚太各经济体以开放包容、互利共赢的理念，建立更紧密的伙伴关系，推动亚太经合组织发挥更大引领作用，推动亚太地区一体化发展，勾画亚太长远发展愿景，谋求合作共赢；加强亚太成员间宏观经济政策协调，加强区域自由贸易安排的信息通报和交流，协调推进区域经济一体化；推动转型和增长，加强创新发展，在转型中谋增长，以增长助转型，为亚太发展注入更大动力和活力；继续大力推动全方位基础设施和互联互通建设，努力解决突出问题，通过互联互通密切区域和次区域合作，构建符合亚太一体化方向的经济格局。, 　　中方愿同各方密切沟通，共同办好今年和明年亚太经合组织会议，为亚太地区发展繁荣作出更大贡献。, 　　问：近来，一些亚太新兴市场经济体金融市场出现波动，经济增长面临的不确定因素增多。同时，中国经济增速放缓。国际社会对亚太经济前景及中国经济减速的担忧上升。您对此持何看法？, 　　答：近来，一些亚太新兴市场经济体金融市场出现波动，主要原因是外部因素影响市场预期，导致国际资本抽离。我们呼吁主要发达经济体采取负责任的宏观经济政策，避免引发负面溢出效应。同时，新兴市场经济体也要增强风险防范意识，提高抵御风险能力。需要强调的是，亚太地区谋和平、求稳定、促发展的共同愿望没有改变，亚太地区在世界政治经济版图中的地位和作用上升的历史趋势没有改变，亚太地区经济持续增长的动力和潜力没有改变。, 　　我们有理由相信，亚太地区发展前景是光明的。亚太经合组织成员应该推动亚太地区在世界经济全面复苏和健康成长方面继续发挥引领作用。, 　　今年上半年，中国经济同比增长7.6%，较以往增速有所放缓。这是中国主动调控的结果。我们下定决心稳增长、调结构、促改革，不再简单以国内生产总值论英雄，而以经济增长质量和效益为立足点。今天的调整转型，是为了明天更健康、更高质量、更可持续的增长。, 　　相对讲，中国经济增速并不慢，在亚太地区乃至全球仍名列前茅。中国对实现经济持续健康发展充满信心。中国经济持续健康发展，将为全球经济复苏注入新的动力，为亚太地区共同发展繁荣作出更大贡献。, 　　问：当前，亚太经济一体化进程深入发展，跨太平洋战略经济伙伴关系、区域全面经济伙伴关系等区域自由贸易协定不断涌现。您对亚太经济一体化有何看法？亚太经合组织能发挥什么作用？, 　　答：亚太经济一体化为我们勾画了地区经济高度融合、亚太合作深入发展的美好愿景。这是亚太经合组织成员的共同使命，也是亚太未来发展的宏伟目标。, 　　当前，亚太地区各种自由贸易安排不断涌现，这是区域一体化深入发展的积极进展，我们要通过发展区域自由贸易安排扩大市场开放，深化区域经济融合。, 　　“海纳百川，有容乃大”。中国始终积极支持和参与亚太经济一体化进程，对任何有利于推进亚太区域一体化进程的机制安排都持开放态度。同时，我们认为，各方在开展自由贸易区建设时要秉持开放、包容、透明的原则，尤其对发展水平不同的经济体要体现灵活性，使各经济体在一体化路径上有更多选择。, 　　作为亚太地区层级最高、领域最广、最具影响力的经济合作组织，亚太经合组织应该发挥引领和协调作用，推动各自由贸易安排加强信息交流，提高透明度和开放水平，使之相互借鉴、相互推进，形成彼此融合、互为补充的局面，为最终实现亚太经济一体化创造有利条件。, 　　问：今年是中国—东盟建立战略伙伴关系10周年。10年来，双方关系取得了很大发展。各界非常关注中国—东盟关系未来发展走向，包括如何处理南海问题。您如何看待中国—东盟关系在下一个10年发展前景？, 　　答：中国和东盟国家山水相连、血脉相亲，就像一个大家庭。双方友好交往源远流长。今年是中国和东盟建立战略伙伴关系10周年。回顾10年来中国—东盟关系发展，相互尊重、平等相待、睦邻友好、互利共赢贯穿双方关系发展始终。中国—东盟关系已经超越双边范畴，具有重要的地区乃至全球意义，成为东亚繁荣稳定的基石。, 　　中国奉行与邻为善、以邻为伴的周边外交方针，将努力使自身发展更好惠及周边。我们将坚定不移把东盟作为周边外交优先方向，坚定不移深化同东盟的战略伙伴关系，坚定不移同东盟携手努力，维护本地区包括南海地区和平稳定。关于国家之间存在的一些分歧和矛盾，中方一直主张通过友好协商和对话予以妥善解决，并将为此作出不懈努力。中国将一如既往支持东盟发展壮大，支持东盟共同体建设，支持东盟在东亚合作中的主导地位。, 　　作为亚洲新兴市场国家，中国和东盟不仅命运相联，也是地区乃至世界经济持续增长的希望所在。中国和东盟都是发展中经济体，我们面临的最主要任务是发展经济、改善民生。中国同东盟合作，不仅将为我们各自国家发展提供广阔空间和不竭商机，也将为世界繁荣稳定作出更大贡献。, 　　中国同东盟关系有着巨大的发展潜力和拓展空间。未来一个时期，双方要抓好几件事情。一是保持高层往来，加强战略沟通，不断增进互信。二是提升中国—东盟自由贸易区水平，进一步相互开放市场，推进贸易和投资自由化便利化。三是推进互联互通，建立亚洲基础设施投融资平台，解决瓶颈问题。四是发挥中国—东盟海上合作基金作用，开展海上务实合作。五是深化防务安全领域合作，完善双方防长会晤机制，积极推动执法安全部门的交流合作，共同维护本地区和平安宁。六是密切各层次民间交往，特别是民众交流，增进相互了解和友谊，夯实中国—东盟睦邻友好关系民意基础和社会基础。七是加强在国际和地区事务中的沟通协调，共同维护发展中国家权益，推进国际关系民主化进程。, 　　问：东盟国家希望中国坚持走和平发展道路，希望中国梦能同各国追求美好生活、实现国家发展的梦想相辅相成。您对此怎么看？, 　　答：中华民族几千年来形成了兼爱非攻、亲仁善邻、以和为贵、和而不同的理念。中国奉行与邻为善、以邻为伴的周边外交方针，对亚洲繁荣稳定作出了重要贡献。当前，经济全球化、区域经济一体化不断发展，亚洲已经成为世界经济增长重要引擎，保持亚洲稳定和发展符合包括中国在内的亚洲各国的利益，中国的命运已经同亚洲各国的命运紧密相连。, 　　当前，中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦奋力拼搏。我们的目标是在中国共产党成立100年时全面建成小康社会，在中华人民共和国成立100年时建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家。要实现这些目标，中国需要一个和平稳定的周边环境。, 　　走和平发展道路是中华民族从自己根本利益、长远利益出发所作出的必然选择。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，永远不会动摇。, 　　中国梦同东盟各国寻求国家发展振兴、人民富裕幸福的追求和梦想息息相通，中国愿同东盟各国在实现理想的道路上携手并肩、心心相印、互帮互助，发挥各自优势，挖掘合作潜力，实现互利共赢。, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2013年10月03日 02 版）, ]",习近平主席接受印度尼西亚和马来西亚媒体联合采访,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/23099538
13,157,"[, On the eve of state visits to Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, and Mexico, President Xi Jinping accepted joint written interviews with Tedo’s “Express”, Costa Rica’s “Republic”, and Mexico’s “Supreme”. The full text is as follows:, Q: Please introduce the significance of your visit to Latin America and the Caribbean. What do you expect from developing relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries? A: During my tenure as Vice President of China, I visited Latin America and the Caribbean twice in 2009 and 2011. The warmth and friendship of the Latin American people and the deep friendship for the Chinese people left a deep impression on me. This is my first visit to Latin America since I assumed the post of President of China. The purpose is to deepen the traditional friendship between China and Latin America and expand mutually beneficial cooperation. During my visit, I will exchange in-depth views with leaders of the three countries on strengthening bilateral and Sino-Latin American relations, and have extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in the three countries. I believe that this visit will effectively promote the further development of the comprehensive cooperative partnership of equality, mutual benefit and common development between China and Latin America. , ""The confidants in the sea and the neighbors are close to each other."" Although China and Latin America are far apart, the friendship between China and Latin America has a long history. As early as a few centuries ago, the China-Latin America trade messenger opened up the ""Maritime Silk Road"" and became an important trade channel connecting the two hemispheres. Since the beginning of the new century, in the face of a complex and ever-changing international situation, China and Latin America adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, firmly grasp the theme of common development, and work together to make great progress in China-Latin America relations. Politically, China and Latin America understand and support each other on strategic issues that are important to each other’s core interests while exploring development paths suitable for their respective national conditions. Strategic mutual trust is constantly increasing. Economically, the pragmatic cooperation between China and Latin America has achieved fruitful results and brought tangible benefits to the people of both sides. In 2012, China-Latin America trade volume reached 261.2 billion US dollars. China has become the second largest trading partner of Latin America. Latin America is currently the fastest growing region in global exports to China. China's cumulative investment in Latin America is nearly 65 billion US dollars, creating a lot of jobs for Latin American countries. In international affairs, China and Latin America have strengthened coordination and cooperation, effectively safeguarding the fundamental interests of both sides and the common interests of developing countries. China and Latin America also actively explored and carried out overall cooperation in order to give full play to their respective advantages and build a better platform for promoting China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership. China and Latin America share a common development philosophy. Both in terms of governance and international affairs, both sides have more and more common languages. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that the development of China-Latin America relations is open development, inclusive development, cooperative development, and win-win development. This is in the common interests of both China and Latin America and has also made positive contributions to regional, world and peace, stability and prosperity. Looking ahead, we are willing to work together with Latin American and Caribbean countries to continuously promote the comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and Latin America and better benefit both peoples. I have full confidence in the prospect of China-Latin America relations. , Q: How do you view the development of bilateral relations between China and Tedo? What cooperation can the two sides carry out in the energy field? What measures will China take in terms of tariffs, etc., to help special manufacturing products enter a faster-growing market like the BRICS countries? , A: I will visit Trinidad and Tobago soon. This is my first visit to Teduo, and it will be the first time in history that the Chinese President visited the English-speaking Caribbean region. I look forward to this visit. , China-Turkey friendship has a long history. More than two centuries ago, the first Chinese arrived in Trinidad Island, where they took root and took root in harmony with the local people, becoming an inseparable part of the multi-ethnic and cultural diversity of Ted. The Chinese people will not forget that before the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the special people will cast a solemn vote for the restoration of the People’s Republic of China’s legal seat in the United Nations. , In 1974, China established diplomatic relations with Tedo, and a new chapter in relations between the two countries was opened. I am very happy to see that since the establishment of diplomatic relations, especially since the establishment of mutually beneficial and friendly relations of cooperation in 2005, the relations between the two countries have made great progress. Tedo has become one of China's most important partners in the English-speaking Caribbean region. The cooperation between the two countries in infrastructure construction, mining, finance, communications, health and other fields has been fruitful, and it has made positive contributions to the economic and social development of China and Tedo, and benefited the people of both countries. Next year is the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Special Countries. I hope the two sides will take this opportunity to make joint efforts to push the friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries to a higher level. Teduo is a major oil and gas country in the Caribbean region. The cooperation in the field of energy between China and Straits is highly complementary and has great potential. It can be a new growth point for cooperation between the two countries. The governments, financial institutions, and enterprises of the two countries can strengthen discussions on energy cooperation, constantly innovate cooperation methods, and expand cooperation. , Teduo and China are geographically far apart,Governments, financial institutions, and enterprises can strengthen discussions on energy cooperation, continuously innovate cooperation methods, and expand cooperation. Teduo and China are geographically far apart, and bilateral trade may be affected to some extent by high transportation costs. However, China has adopted a strong tariff policy to encourage the development of economic and trade exchanges with Caribbean countries, including Teddoo. Many traditional advantage products of the special party have already enjoyed zero tariff or lower tariff in China's tariff. In fact, in the past 10 years, Tedo's exports to China have increased by nearly 30 times, reaching 140 million US dollars last year. I hope that the enterprises of the two countries will strengthen cooperation and welcome many enterprises to explore the market in China. , Q: How do you evaluate the development of bilateral relations between China and Costa Rica. What is your vision for future cooperation between the two countries? , A: In August 2012, President Chinchilla paid a state visit to China and we had a good meeting. I was deeply impressed by President Chinchilla's willingness to actively develop relations with China. Despite the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Colombia in only six years, with the joint efforts of both sides, the relationship between the two countries has developed rapidly and steadily, with fruitful cooperation in various fields. China-Colombia relations have become a model of cooperation between countries of different sizes and different national conditions. , Costa Rica is the third Latin American country to sign a free trade agreement with China. This agreement came into effect in August 2011. The Costa Rica National Stadium aided by China has become a symbol of friendship between the two peoples. The Confucius Institute at the University of Costa Rica is the first Confucius Institute in Central America and provides an important platform for enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. Facts have proved that the development of friendly cooperative relations between China and Colombia conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples, and has strong vitality and broad space for development. , Q: How do you evaluate the development of bilateral relations between China and Mexico? A: China and Mexico are both emerging market countries and major developing countries. They are strategic partners and important development opportunities for each other. In April this year, President Peña visited China and attended the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Meeting. We had a good conversation on strengthening bilateral relations and reached important consensus. After a lapse of 2 months, I will pay a state visit to Mexico. The exchange of high-level visits between the two countries in a short period of time demonstrates the importance attached by both sides to Sino-Mexico relations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico in 41 years, especially since the establishment of the strategic partnership in 2003, the relations between the two countries have developed tremendously, and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields has been continuously deepened, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples. The China-Mexico relationship is increasingly strategic and global. The two sides maintain close communication and collaboration on major global issues and promote the development of the international order and international system in a more just and reasonable direction. The development of China-Mexico relations has played an important role in promoting world peace and stability. , I look forward to continuing to exchange views with President Peña on deepening the pragmatic cooperation between the two countries during my visit and pushing relations between the two countries to a new level. Q: What mechanisms and measures does China consider to promote the balanced development of bilateral trade between China and Mexico? What industries does China hope to increase investment in Mexico? What policies will China adopt to encourage Mexican companies to invest in China? How likely is China and Mexico to sign a free trade agreement? In what areas will the two sides open up to each other? A: In recent years, China-Mexico economic and trade cooperation has become increasingly deeper and new results have been continuously obtained. China has become Mexico's second largest trading partner in the world, and Mexico is China's second largest trading partner in Latin America. The scale of mutual investment between the two countries has gradually expanded, and the scope of cooperation has been continuously expanded. , China never deliberately pursues a surplus in bilateral trade, and is willing to work together with Mexico to tap the potential of bilateral trade, expand trade scale, optimize trade structure, and seek trade balance between the two countries in a positive way. In recent years, the trend of diversification of Mexico’s exports to China has become more and more obvious. Mexico’s electronic and communications products, crude oil, automobiles, beer, as well as agricultural and sideline products such as tortillas and avocados have increasingly entered the Chinese market. , During my visit to Mexico, the two sides will solve the problem of Mexican pork exports to China. China will also specially organize enterprise delegations to Mexico to carry out project docking and market development. It also welcomes Mexico to send delegations to China-related trade fairs to enhance understanding of the Chinese market and actively promote Mexican products that meet the needs of Chinese consumers. , Mexico is an important Chinese investment partner in Latin America. The scale of China's investment in Mexico is constantly expanding, and its fields are expanding. The Chinese government continues to encourage and support powerful Chinese companies to actively participate in the construction of Mexico’s infrastructure, and support companies in the two countries to carry out substantive cooperation in the fields of mining, energy (including new and renewable energy), manufacturing, telecommunications, agriculture, etc. Cultivate new investment growth points. Since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has fully fulfilled its commitments and the degree of openness has been close to the average level of developed members. At present, foreign investment has been made in most fields of agriculture, manufacturing and service industries. We will implement a more proactive opening strategyAt present, foreign investment has been made in most fields of agriculture, manufacturing and service industries. We will implement a more proactive opening strategy, promote opening to the outside world on a larger scale, in a wider area, and at a higher level, and encourage foreign investment in modern agriculture, high-tech, advanced manufacturing, energy conservation and environmental protection, new energy, modern service industries, etc. . , China welcomes Mexican companies to expand investment in China. China will continue to promote the facilitation of the investment environment, protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises, and strive to create an open and transparent legal and policy environment, an efficient and standardized administrative environment, and a market environment of fair competition for foreign-invested enterprises, including Mexican companies. China has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Peru, and Costa Rica in three Latin American countries, which has played an important role in promoting economic and trade exchanges and investment between China and the three countries. China and Colombia have officially launched the joint feasibility study of the two free trade zones. If the Mexican side has offered to discuss with China to establish a free trade zone, China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Mexico in this regard. , Q: Please tell us the importance of China's 12th Five-Year Plan for China's development? , A: Over the past 30 years, China has made great achievements in reform and opening up, with an average annual economic growth of nearly 10%, a comprehensive increase in national strength, and a GDP that ranks second in the world. At the same time, China's development is uneven, uncoordinated and unsustainable. In 2011, China formulated the ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development"", which proposed the goal of taking the scientific development concept as the main theme and accelerating the transformation of the economic development mode, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7%. This means that we are not blindly pursuing the rate of economic growth, but are focusing more on the quality and efficiency of economic growth. We optimize the economic structure, strive to expand domestic demand and promote consumption, and promote consumption, exports, and investment to keep pace, pulling the economy. The ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan"" also proposes to strive to improve innovation capabilities, promote economic development and rely more on technological innovation, and transform ""Made in China"" into ""Created in China."" The “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” insists on ensuring and improving people’s livelihood as the starting point and end point of accelerating the transformation of economic growth mode, and proposes that urban residents’ per capita disposable income and rural residents’ per capita net income increase by more than 7% annually, respectively, and economic development is achieved Synchronous or higher. We have substantially increased expenditures on education, medical and health care, social security, employment and housing security, so that development results will be more and more fair to all people. The ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan"" proposes to establish the concepts of green development, circular development, and low-carbon development, focusing on energy conservation and emission reduction, accelerating the construction of a resource-saving and environment-friendly society, and promoting the coordination of economic and social development and population, resources, and environment. The road to sustainable development. At present, the fundamentals of China's economic development are good: First, the economic growth rate has stabilized, with GDP growth of 7.8% in 2012 and 7.7% in the first quarter of this year. The second is to achieve positive results in transforming the economic development mode and adjusting the economic structure. Domestic demand, especially consumer demand, has significantly increased the role of economic growth, and the industrial structure upgrade has accelerated. The third is stable employment and increased residents’ income. In 2012, 12.66 million new jobs were added to urban areas. The per capita disposable income of urban residents and the cash income of rural residents actually increased by 9.6% and 10.7%, respectively. Fourth, prices and housing prices remained stable. In 2012, consumer prices rose by 2.6% year-on-year. As the largest developing country in the world, China still faces many difficulties and challenges along the way. To enable all Chinese people to lead a good life, we need to make long-term unremitting efforts. We will insist on unshakable reform and opening up, concentrate on doing our business well, carry out friendly cooperation with all countries in the world, and continue to promote reform and opening up and modernization. Looking ahead to the future, we are filled with confidence. , Q: How does China realize the Chinese dream? , Answer: The Chinese nation has endured hardships and endless self-improvement. It has never given up its yearning and pursuit of a beautiful dream. The Chinese dream to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation since modern times. In the new historical period, the essence of the Chinese dream is the prosperity of the country, national rejuvenation, and happiness of the people. Our goal is to double the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents by 2020, and to build a well-off society in an all-round way. By the middle of this century, build a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, and harmonious socialist modern country, and realize the Chinese dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. To realize the Chinese dream, we must adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have been on this road for more than 30 years. History has proven that this is a correct road that conforms to China's national conditions and is rich and powerful. We will unswervingly follow this road. , Realizing Chinese Dream Must Carry Forward Chinese Spirit. The national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with reform and innovation as the core have inspired the whole nationDreams must promote the Chinese spirit. The national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with reform and innovation as the core have inspired the whole nation's ""spirit"". , To realize the Chinese dream must gather the power of China. Misrepresenting the country and doing a good job. We must use the wisdom and strength of 1.3 billion Chinese people to make unremitting efforts from generation to generation to build our country and develop our nation. To realize the Chinese dream, we must adhere to peaceful development. We will always take the path of peaceful development and pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win. We are not only committed to China's own development, but also emphasize our responsibility and contribution to the world; not only for the Chinese people, but also for the people of the world. Realizing the Chinese dream brings peace to the world, not turbulence; it is opportunity, not threat. Although China and Latin America are separated by vast oceans, our hearts are connected. What connects us is not only the deep traditional friendship and close bond of interests, but also our common pursuit of beautiful dreams. In recent years, Latin America and the Caribbean countries have continuously taken new steps to strengthen themselves. The establishment of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States fully shows that Latin America is actively advancing the dream of unity, cooperation and common development advocated by the pioneers of the Latin American independence movement. China is willing to work closely with Latin American and Caribbean countries in solidarity, mutual support, and sincere cooperation, and work together on the road to the beautiful dream of development and prosperity.

  发布时间：2013-06-01,"[, 在对特立尼达和多巴哥、哥斯达黎加、墨西哥进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平接受了特多《快报》、哥斯达黎加《共和国报》、墨西哥《至上报》的联合书面采访。全文如下：, 问：请介绍您此次访问拉美及加勒比地区的意义。您对发展同拉美和加勒比国家关系有何期待？, 答：我担任中国国家副主席期间，曾于2009年、2011年两次出访拉美和加勒比地区，拉美人民的热情友好和对中国人民的深厚情谊给我留下了深刻印象。, 这次是我担任中国国家主席后首次访问拉美，目的是深化中拉传统友好、扩大互利合作。访问期间，我将同三国领导人就加强双边和中拉关系深入交换意见，并同三国各界人士广泛接触。我相信，这次访问将有力推动中拉平等互利、共同发展的全面合作伙伴关系进一步向前发展。, “海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”中国和拉美虽然相距遥远，但中拉友好源远流长。早在几个世纪前，中拉贸易使者就开辟了“海上丝绸之路”，成为联系东西两个半球的重要贸易通道。进入新世纪以来，面对复杂多变的国际形势，中拉双方坚持平等互利原则，牢牢把握共同发展主题，携手努力推动中拉关系取得长足进展。, 政治上，中拉双方在涉及彼此核心利益的重大问题上，在探索适合各自国情的发展道路的过程中，相互理解、相互支持，战略互信不断增强。经济上，中拉务实合作硕果累累，给双方人民都带来了实实在在的利益。2012年，中拉贸易额达到2612亿美元，中国已成为拉美第二大贸易伙伴国，拉美是目前全球对华出口增速最快的地区。中国在拉美累计投资将近650亿美元，为拉美国家创造了大量就业岗位。, 在国际事务中，中拉加强协调配合，有力维护了双方根本利益和发展中国家共同利益。中拉还积极探索开展整体合作，以综合发挥双方各自优势，为推进中拉全面合作伙伴关系搭建更好平台。, 中拉拥有共同的发展理念，不论在治国理政方面，还是在国际事务中，双方都拥有越来越多的共同语言。事实已经并将继续证明，中拉关系发展是开放的发展、包容的发展、合作的发展、共赢的发展。这符合中拉双方共同利益，也为地区和世界的和平、稳定、繁荣作出了积极贡献。, 展望未来，我们愿同拉美和加勒比国家一道努力，不断推进中拉全面合作伙伴关系，更好造福双方人民。我对中拉关系发展前景充满信心。, 问：如何看待中国同特多双边关系的发展？双方在能源领域可以开展哪些合作？中国将在关税等方面采取什么措施，以帮助特多制造业产品进入像金砖国家这样增长较快的市场？, 答：我即将访问特立尼达和多巴哥。这是我首次访问特多，也将是历史上中国国家主席首次访问英语加勒比地区。我对这次访问充满期待。, 中特友谊源远流长。两个多世纪前，首批华人抵达特立尼达岛，在那里落地生根，同当地民众和睦相处，成为特多多元民族和文化密不可分的一部分。, 中国人民不会忘记，在两国建交前，特多人民就为中华人民共和国恢复在联合国合法席位投下庄严的一票。, 1974年，中国同特多建交，两国关系翻开了新篇章。我很高兴地看到，建交以来，特别是2005年建立互利发展的友好合作关系以来，两国关系取得长足发展。特多已经成为中国在英语加勒比地区最重要的合作伙伴之一。两国基础设施建设、矿业、金融、通信、卫生等领域合作富有成效，为中国和特多经济社会发展作出了积极贡献，使两国人民从中受益。, 明年是中特建交40周年，希望双方以此为契机，共同努力，将两国友好关系和互利合作推向更高水平。, 特多是加勒比地区油气大国，中特能源领域合作互补性强，潜力巨大，完全可以成为两国合作新的增长点。两国政府、金融机构、企业可以就能源合作加强探讨，不断创新合作方式、拓宽合作面。, 特多和中国地理相距较远，双边贸易一定程度上可能受高运输成本的影响，但中国采取了有力的关税政策，鼓励同包括特多在内的加勒比国家发展经贸往来。特方许多传统优势产品在中国关税税则中已经享有零关税或较低关税。事实上，近10年来，特多对华出口额增长了近30倍，去年达到1.4亿美元。我希望两国企业加强合作，欢迎特多企业到中国开拓市场。, 问：您如何评价中国同哥斯达黎加双边关系发展。您对未来两国合作有何设想？, 答：2012年8月，钦奇利亚总统对中国进行国事访问，我们进行了很好的会见。钦奇利亚总统积极发展对华关系的意愿给我留下深刻印象。, 尽管中哥建交仅仅6年时间，但在双方共同努力下，两国关系快速稳定发展，各领域合作成果丰硕。中哥关系已成为不同幅员、不同国情国家合作的典范。, 哥斯达黎加是第三个同中国签订自由贸易协定的拉美国家，这个协定于2011年8月正式生效。中方援建的哥斯达黎加国家体育场已经成为两国人民友谊的象征。哥斯达黎加大学孔子学院是中美洲第一所孔子学院，为增进两国人民相互了解和友谊提供了重要平台。事实证明，中哥两国发展友好合作关系符合两国和两国人民的根本利益，具有强大生命力和广阔发展空间。, 问：您如何评价中国同墨西哥双边关系发展？, 答：中墨同为新兴市场国家和发展中大国，互为战略伙伴，互为重要发展机遇。今年4月，培尼亚总统访华并出席博鳌亚洲论坛年会，我们就加强双边关系进行了很好的交谈，并达成重要共识。时隔2个月，我将对墨西哥进行国事访问。短时间内两国高层实现互访，体现了双方对中墨关系的高度重视。, 中墨建交41年来，特别是2003年建立战略伙伴关系以来，两国关系得到长足发展，各领域互利合作不断深化，给两国人民带来了实实在在的利益。中墨关系越来越具有战略性和全局性。双方在重大全球性问题上保持密切沟通和协作，推动国际秩序和国际体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。中墨关系的发展为促进世界和平与稳定发挥了重要作用。, 我期待着访问期间同培尼亚总统继续就深化两国务实合作交换意见，推动两国关系再上新台阶。 , 问：中方考虑通过哪些机制和措施促进中墨双边贸易平衡发展？中方希望对墨西哥哪些产业增加投资？中方将采取哪些政策鼓励墨西哥企业对华投资？中墨签署自贸协定可能性有多大？双方将在哪些领域扩大相互开放？, 答：近年来，中墨经贸合作日益深化，不断取得新成果。中国已经成为墨西哥在全球的第二大贸易伙伴，墨西哥是中国在拉美地区的第二大贸易伙伴。两国相互投资规模逐步扩大，合作领域不断拓宽。, 中方在双边贸易中从不刻意追求顺差，愿同墨方共同努力，挖掘双边贸易潜力，扩大贸易规模，优化贸易结构，以积极方式寻求两国贸易平衡。, 近年来，墨西哥对华出口多元化趋势日益明显，墨西哥电子和通信产品、原油、汽车、啤酒以及玉米饼、鳄梨等农副产品越来越多地进入中国市场。, 我这次访问墨西哥期间，双方将解决墨西哥猪肉输华问题。中方还将专门组织企业代表团赴墨西哥开展项目对接和市场开拓，也欢迎墨方派团参加中国相关贸易展会，增进对中国市场了解，积极宣传符合中国消费者需求的墨西哥产品。, 墨西哥是中国在拉美重要投资合作伙伴。中国对墨西哥投资规模不断扩大，领域日益拓宽。中国政府继续鼓励和支持有实力的中国企业积极参与墨西哥基础设施建设，支持两国企业在矿业、能源（包括新能源和可再生能源）、制造业、电信、农业等领域开展实质性合作，不断培育新的投资增长点。, 自2001年加入世界贸易组织以来，中国全面履行承诺，开放程度已经接近发达成员平均水平。目前，农业、制造业、服务业的绝大多数领域都已经有外商投资。我们将实施更加积极主动的开放战略，在更大范围、更广领域、更高水平上推进对外开放，鼓励外资投向现代农业、高新技术、先进制造、节能环保、新能源、现代服务业等领域。, 中方欢迎墨西哥企业扩大对华投资。中方将继续推进投资环境便利化，保护外资企业合法权益，努力为包括墨西哥企业在内的外商投资企业营造公开透明的法律政策环境、高效规范的行政环境、平等竞争的市场环境。, 中国已同智利、秘鲁、哥斯达黎加3个拉美国家签署了自由贸易协定，为促进中国同三国经贸往来和投资发挥了重要作用。中国还同哥伦比亚正式启动两国自由贸易区联合可行性研究。如墨方提出愿同中方商谈建立自由贸易区，中方愿加强同墨方在这方面的合作。, 问：请介绍中国“十二五”规划对中国发展的重要性？, 答：过去30多年，中国改革开放取得巨大成就，经济年均增长近10%，综合国力大幅提升，国内生产总值跃居世界第二位。与此同时，中国发展不平衡、不协调、不可持续问题日益突出。2011年，中国制定了《国民经济和社会发展第十二个五年规划》，提出以科学发展观为主题、以加快转变经济发展方式为主线，国内生产总值年均增长7%的目标。这意味着我们不一味追求经济增长速度，而是更加注重经济增长质量和效益。我们优化经济结构，着力扩大内需和促进消费，推动消费、出口、投资并驾齐驱，拉动经济。, “十二五”规划还提出要努力提高创新能力，推动经济发展更多依靠科技创新驱动，将“中国制造”更多变成“中国创造”。, “十二五”规划坚持把保障和改善民生作为加快转变经济增长方式的出发点和落脚点，提出城镇居民人均可支配收入和农村居民人均纯收入分别年均增长7％以上，和经济发展实现同步或更高。我们大幅增加教育、医疗卫生、社会保障、就业和住房保障支出，使发展成果更多更公平惠及全体人民。, “十二五”规划提出树立绿色发展、循环发展、低碳发展理念，以节能减排为重点，加快构建资源节约型、环境友好型社会，促进经济社会发展和人口资源环境相协调，走可持续发展道路。, 当前，中国经济发展基本面是好的：一是经济增速趋于稳定，2012年国内生产总值增长7.8%，今年一季度增长7.7%。二是转变经济发展方式和调整经济结构取得积极成效，国内需求特别是消费需求对经济增长的拉动作用明显提高，产业结构升级加快。三是就业稳定，居民收入增加，2012年城镇新增就业1266万人，城镇居民人均可支配收入和农村居民人均现金收入实际分别增长9.6%和10.7%。四是物价和房价保持稳定，2012年居民消费价格同比上涨2.6%。, 中国作为世界上最大的发展中国家，前进道路上仍面临着不少困难和挑战。要使全体中国人民都过上美好生活，还需要做出长期不懈努力。我们将坚持改革开放不动摇，集中精力把我们的事情办好，同世界各国开展友好合作，不断推进改革开放和现代化建设。展望未来，我们充满信心。, 问：中国如何实现中国梦？, 答：中华民族历经磨难，自强不息，从未放弃对美好梦想的向往和追求。实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦是近代以来中华民族的夙愿。, 在新的历史时期，中国梦的本质是国家富强、民族振兴、人民幸福。我们的奋斗目标是，到2020年国内生产总值和城乡居民人均收入在2010年基础上翻一番，全面建成小康社会。到本世纪中叶，建成富强民主文明和谐的社会主义现代化国家，实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦。, 实现中国梦，必须坚持中国特色社会主义道路。我们已经在这条道路上走了30多年，历史证明，这是一条符合中国国情、富民强国的正确道路，我们将坚定不移地沿着这条道路走下去。, 实现中国梦，必须弘扬中国精神。用以爱国主义为核心的民族精神和以改革创新为核心的时代精神振奋起全民族的“精气神”。, 实现中国梦，必须凝聚中国力量。空谈误国，实干兴邦。我们要用13亿中国人的智慧和力量，一代又一代中国人不懈努力，把我们的国家建设好，把我们的民族发展好。, 实现中国梦，必须坚持和平发展。我们将始终不渝走和平发展道路，始终不渝奉行互利共赢的开放战略，不仅致力于中国自身发展，也强调对世界的责任和贡献；不仅造福中国人民，而且造福世界人民。实现中国梦给世界带来的是和平，不是动荡；是机遇，不是威胁。, 中国和拉美虽然远隔重洋，但我们的心是相通的。联结我们的不仅是深厚传统友谊、密切利益纽带，还有我们对美好梦想的共同追求。, 近年来，拉美和加勒比国家联合自强不断迈出新步伐。拉美和加勒比国家共同体的成立，充分表明拉美正在积极推进拉美独立运动先驱们倡导的团结协作、共同发展的梦想。, 中国愿同拉美和加勒比各国紧密团结、相互支持、真诚合作，在通往发展繁荣的美好梦想的道路上携手共进。（新华社北京５月３１日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年06月01日 01 版）, ]",习近平接受拉美三国媒体联合书面采访,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/21697871
14,158,"[,, 　　 On March 25th, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the Nyerere International Convention Center in Dar es Salaam. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yeshe, Dear President Kikwete, Ladies and gentlemen, friends:, 　　 Habali! Habari! Today, I am very happy and cordial to meet my friends at the Nyerere International Conference Center in Tanzania. , 　　 This is my first visit to Africa since I assumed the presidency of China, and it is also my sixth time to set foot on the African continent. As soon as I set foot on this beautiful land of Tanzania, I felt the warm and unrelenting friendship of the Tanzanian people towards the Chinese people. The Tanzanian government and people held a special grand welcome ceremony. This not only values ​​the Chinese delegation and China, but also reflects the profound traditional friendship between China and Tanzania and the two peoples. , 　　 First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the friends here, to the brothers of Tanzania and Africa. I also want to thank President Kikwete and the Tanzanian government for their careful arrangements and warm reception for my visit! , 　　 Tanzania is one of the birthplaces of mankind. The people of Tanzania have a glorious tradition and have made important contributions to the African people’s victory in fighting for national independence and fighting against apartheid. In recent years, under the leadership of President Kikwete, Tanzania’s political situation has remained stable, and the construction industry is flourishing. It has played an important role in African and international affairs. The Chinese people are sincerely happy for your achievements, and sincerely wish the brothers Tanzanian people to continuously achieve new and greater achievements. , 　　 came to Africa, there are always two outstanding impressions. The first is to come and stay new. Every time I visit Africa, I can deeply feel the new developments and changes of this continent, which is very encouraging. Second, the enthusiasm is like fire. The friendly friendship sent by the African people to the Chinese people is as warm and warm as the sunshine of Africa, which is unforgettable. , 　　 There is a proverb in Africa: ""The river has deep springs."" China-Africa friendly exchanges have a long history. In the 1950s and 1960s, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other first-generation leaders of the new China and the older generation of politicians in Africa jointly opened a new era of China-Africa relations. Since then, the Chinese and African people have supported and sincerely cooperated with each other on the road of development and rejuvenation in the struggle against colonialism, imperialism, national independence and liberation, and forged brothers who share the same breath, share the same destiny, and join hands Friendship. Today, with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Africa relations have entered the fast track of comprehensive development. The two sides established the China-Africa Cooperation Forum to build a new type of strategic partnership, and cooperation in various fields has achieved remarkable results. In 2012, China-Africa trade volume was close to USD 200 billion, and China-Africa personnel exchanges exceeded 1.5 million. As of last year, China’s direct investment in Africa has exceeded US$15 billion. This year marks the 50th anniversary of China's dispatch of medical teams to Africa. Over the past 50 years, 18,000 medical personnel have been dispatched to diagnose and treat 250 million African patients.　　The African people have also given the Chinese people great support and selfless help. In the process of the 2008 Beijing Olympics torch relay in Dar es Salaam, the people of Tanzania greeted the Olympic torch with songs and dances as they celebrated their own festivals. The joyful picture was deeply fixed in the minds of the Chinese people. , 　　 After the devastating Wenchuan Earthquake in China, African countries have offered assistance, and some countries are not rich themselves, with a population of less than 2 million, and generously donated 2 million euros to the earthquake-stricken area, which is equivalent to 1 euro per capita. This friendship gives China The people feel warm. , 　　 Our two sides continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, effectively safeguarding the common interests of developing countries. The friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the African people has become a symbol of China-Africa relations and has become a good story in the international community. , Related news:, 　　The joint efforts of the past half a century and the rich results it has produced have laid a solid foundation and accumulated valuable experience for us to continue to advance China-Africa relations. , 　　-This piece of history tells us that Sino-African relations did not develop in a day, nor were they given by anyone, but that our two sides came out with one step at a time, in common with each other. Drinking water does not forget to dig wells. We will always remember the people who have worked hard and worked hard to develop Sino-African relations and continue to draw momentum from history. , 　　-This piece of history tells us that China and Africa have always been a community of shared destiny. Common historical encounters, common development tasks, and common strategic interests link us closely. We all regard each other's development as our own opportunities, and are actively promoting common development and prosperity through strengthening cooperationStrategic interests connect us closely. We all regard each other's development as our own opportunity and are actively promoting common development and prosperity through strengthening cooperation. , 　　-This history tells us that the essential characteristics of China-Africa relations are sincerity and friendship, mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and common development. We can talk to each other and feel equal to each other; we do not impose your will on you, nor do you impose your will on us. China has provided assistance within its capacity for Africa's development. China is even more grateful to the African countries and African people for their long-term support and selfless help. We have always been clear-cut and unambiguous on issues related to each other's core interests. Support each other. , 　　-This piece of history tells us that for China-Africa relations to maintain vigorous vitality, it must advance with the times and be innovative. For more than half a century, in every critical period of the development of China-Africa relations, both of us can reach a high level, find new points of cooperation and growth in China-Africa cooperation, and push China-Africa relations to achieve a new leap forward. This pioneering spirit of opening roads in every mountain and building bridges in water is an important magic weapon for us to continuously improve the level of China-Africa cooperation. ,   Ladies and gentlemen! At present, China-Africa relations are standing at a new historical starting point, with the advantages of time, geographical advantages, and harmony. As a ""continent of hope"" and a ""hot spot for development"", Africa today has become one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. The African lions are accelerating and China continues to maintain a good momentum of development. The foundation for China-Africa cooperation is more solid, the willingness to cooperate is stronger, and the cooperation mechanism is more perfect. Promoting China-Africa cooperation is the common aspiration of the people of both sides and the trend of the times and the desire of the people. , 　　Here, I can tell my friends clearly that under the new situation, the importance of China-Africa relations has not decreased but has increased. The common interests of both sides have not decreased but increased. The strength of China’s development of relations with Africa will not be weakened. It will only strengthen. , 　　 First, for African friends, we speak a ""true"" word. True friends are the most valuable. The traditional friendship between China and Africa is precious and worthy of being cherished. We have always regarded the development of solidarity and cooperation with African countries as an important basis for China’s foreign policy. This will never change because of China’s own development and the improvement of its international status. China insists that the country is equal regardless of its size, strength and weakness, and the rich and the poor. It upholds justice and justice, opposes bullying the small, bullying the weak, and suppressing poverty with the rich, and opposes interference in the internal affairs of other countries. It will continue to be involved with the African side. The other side supports each other's core interests and issues of major concern, and continues to firmly support the just positions of African countries in international and regional affairs to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. China will continue to firmly support Africa’s efforts to independently resolve regional issues and make greater contributions to the promotion of peace and security in Africa. , 　　 There is no one-size-fits-all development model in the world, and all parties should respect the diversity of world civilizations and development models. China will continue to firmly support African countries in exploring development paths suitable for their national conditions, strengthen exchanges of experience with African countries in governance and governance, draw wisdom from their respective ancient civilizations and development practices, and promote the common development and prosperity of China and Africa. , 　　 family harmony. All Africa is a big family with a shared destiny. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Organization of African Unity, and is a milestone for the people of African countries pursuing unity and self-improvement. China sincerely wishes and firmly supports Africa to make greater strides on the road of unity and self-improvement, and push Africa's cause of peace and development to a new level. , 　　 China hopes that China-Africa relations will develop better and better, and that other countries’ relations with Africa will develop better and better. Africa is Africa of Africans. Any country developing relations with Africa should respect Africa’s dignity and autonomy. , 　　Second, to carry out cooperation with Africa, we speak of a ""real"" word. China is not only an advocate of win-win cooperation, but also an active practitioner. China is committed to closely linking its own development with the development of Africa, closely integrating the interests of the Chinese people with the interests of the African people, and closely integrating China’s development opportunities with African development opportunities, and sincerely hopes that African countries will develop faster and the African people live Live better. While seeking its own development, China has always provided support and assistance to African friends within its ability. Especially in recent years, China has increased its assistance and cooperation to Africa. As long as it is a commitment made by the Chinese side, it will definitely be implemented without compromise. , 　　 China will continue to expand investment and financing cooperation with Africa, implement its commitment to provide 20 billion US dollars of loans to Africa within three years, implement the ""African Transnational and Cross-Regional Infrastructure Construction Partnership"" and strengthen cooperation with African countries in agriculture and manufacturing. Mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of industry and other fields helps African countries turn resource advantages into development advantages and achieve independent development and sustainable development. ,Mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of agriculture and manufacturing has helped African countries transform their resource advantages into development advantages and achieve independent development and sustainable development. , 　　 teaches people to fish, but also teaches people to fish. China will actively implement the ""African Talent Program"". In the next three years, it will train 30,000 talents of various types for African countries, provide 18,000 scholarships for foreign students, and strengthen technology transfer and experience sharing in Africa.　　 As China's economic strength and overall national strength continue to increase, China will continue to provide Africa with the assistance it deserves without any political conditions. , 　　 Third, to strengthen China-Africa friendship, let's talk about a ""pro"". The Chinese people and the African people have a natural sense of closeness. ""Life is about knowing each other."" How does China and Africa know each other? I think it is very important to get heart-to-heart resonance through in-depth dialogue and practical actions.　　The foundation and blood of China-Africa relations are in the people. The development of China-Africa relations should be more oriented towards the people. In recent years, with the development of China-Africa relations, the people of China and Africa have come closer. Some African friends are active in the Chinese literary arena and have become well-known stars in China. The Chinese TV series ""Beauty Era of Daughter-in-Law"" was popular in Tanzania, which made Tanzanian audiences understand the ups and downs of the family life of Chinese people. , 　　 I heard a story about a pair of Chinese young people who have known Africa through television programs since childhood and are full of longing for Africa. Later they got married and chose their honeymoon destination in Tanzania. On the first Valentine's Day after the wedding, they came to Tanzania with their backpacks on their backs, enjoying the local customs and the magnificence of the Serengeti grassland. After returning to China, they posted what they saw in Tanzania on their blogs, and received tens of thousands of clicks and hundreds of replies. They said that we really fell in love with Africa, and our hearts can no longer be separated from this magical land. This story shows that the people of China and Africa have a natural sense of closeness. As long as the exchanges between the people are continuously strengthened, the friendship between the people of China and Africa will surely take root. , 　　 We should pay more attention to the humanities exchanges between China and Africa, enhance the mutual understanding and cognition between the people of China and Africa, and build the social foundation of China-Africa friendship. China-Africa relations are a future-oriented enterprise that requires generations of aspiring young people from China and Africa to continue their struggle. Both sides should actively promote youth exchanges so that the successor of China-Africa friendship will continue to be youthful and energetic. , 　　 Fourth, to solve problems in cooperation, we speak of a word of ""sincerity"". Both China and Africa are in the process of rapid development, and mutual understanding needs to keep pace with the times. China candidly confronts the new situation and new problems facing China-Africa relations, and we should properly solve the problems that arise in the spirit of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. , 　　 I believe that opportunities are always greater than challenges, and solutions are always more difficult than difficulties. China has and will continue to work with African countries to take effective measures to properly solve the problems in China-Africa economic and trade cooperation, so that African countries can benefit more from cooperation. At the same time, we sincerely hope that African countries will provide corresponding convenience for Chinese enterprises and citizens to cooperate in Africa. ,   Ladies and gentlemen! , 　　 60 years after the founding of New China, especially 30 years of reform and opening up Significantly enhanced, people's lives improved significantly. As a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, China has spent decades traversing the course of development that developed countries have traveled for hundreds of years. The hardships and twists and turns in this can be imagined. Now, China's basic national conditions are still large in population, weak in foundation, and uneven in development. Although the total economic volume is large, divided by more than 1.3 billion people, the per capita GDP is still ranked around the 90th in the world. According to UN standards, China has 128 million people living below the poverty line. To allow more than 1.3 billion people to live a prosperous life, there is still a long way to go, and long-term hard work is still required. As China continues to develop, the living standards of the Chinese people will continue to improve. However, no matter what step China develops, China will always regard African countries as its friend in trouble. ,   Ladies and gentlemen!　　 China's development cannot be separated from the world or Africa, and the prosperity and stability of the world and Africa also need China. Although China and Africa are far away from each other, our hearts are connected. What connects us is not only the deep traditional friendship, close interests, but also our own dreams.　　 More than 1.3 billion Chinese people are committed to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and more than 1 billion African people are committed to realizing the African dream of unity and self-reliance and development. The people of China and Africa should strengthen unity and cooperation, strengthen mutual support and help, and strive to realize our respective dreams. We have to work with the international communityAfrican dream. The people of China and Africa should strengthen unity and cooperation, strengthen mutual support and help, and strive to realize our respective dreams. We must also work with the international community to promote the realization of a world dream of lasting peace and common prosperity, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development! , 　　 Assante Nisana! , 　　 Note:, 　　 Habari, Habari, Swahili, meaning ""hello everyone"". , 　　 Assante Nisana, Asantinisana, Swahili, meaning ""Thank you all"". , 　　 (People's Daily, Dar es Salaam, March 25th),]",Xi Jinping: Always be a reliable friend and sincere partner,4653,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2013-03-26,"[, ,  , 　　3月25日，习近平主席在达累斯萨拉姆尼雷尔国际会议中心发表演讲。新华社记者 王 晔摄, 尊敬的基奎特总统，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　哈巴里！哈巴里！今天，能够在坦桑尼亚尼雷尔国际会议中心同各位朋友见面，感到十分高兴和亲切。, 　　这是我担任中国国家主席之后首次访问非洲，也是我第六次踏上非洲大陆。一踏上坦桑尼亚这片美丽的土地，我就感受到了坦桑尼亚人民对中国人民热情奔放的友情，坦桑尼亚政府和人民举行了特殊的隆重欢迎仪式。这不仅是对我和中国代表团的重视，更体现了中坦两国和两国人民深厚的传统友谊。, 　　首先，我谨代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义，向在座各位朋友，向兄弟的坦桑尼亚人民和非洲人民，致以诚挚的问候和良好的祝愿！我还要感谢基奎特总统和坦桑尼亚政府为我这次访问所作的精心安排和热情接待！, 　　坦桑尼亚是人类发源地之一。坦桑尼亚人民有着光荣传统，为非洲人民赢得争取民族独立、反对种族隔离斗争的胜利作出了重要贡献。, 　　近年来，在基奎特总统领导下，坦桑尼亚政局保持稳定，建设事业蒸蒸日上，在非洲和国际事务中发挥了重要作用。中国人民为你们取得的成就感到由衷的高兴，衷心祝愿兄弟的坦桑尼亚人民不断取得新的更大的成就。, 　　来到非洲，总有两个突出印象。一是常来常新，每次非洲之行都能深切感受到这片大陆的新发展新变化，让人欢欣鼓舞。二是热情似火，非洲人民对中国人民发自内心的友好情谊，就像非洲的阳光那样温暖热烈，让人难以忘怀。, 　　非洲有句谚语：“河有源泉水才深。”中非友好交往源远流长。上世纪五六十年代，毛泽东、周恩来等新中国第一代领导人和非洲老一辈政治家共同开启了中非关系新纪元。从那时起，中非人民在反殖反帝、争取民族独立和解放的斗争中，在发展振兴的道路上，相互支持、真诚合作，结下了同呼吸、共命运、心连心的兄弟情谊。, 　　今天，在双方共同努力下，中非关系已经进入全面发展的快车道。双方成立了中非合作论坛，构建起新型战略伙伴关系，各领域合作取得显著成果。２０１２年，中非贸易额接近２０００亿美元，中非人员往来超过１５０万人次。截至去年，中国对非洲的直接投资累计超过１５０亿美元。今年是中国向非洲派出医疗队５０周年，５０年来累计派出１．８万人次的医疗人员，诊治了２．５亿人次的非洲患者。, 　　非洲人民也给了中国人民大力支持和无私帮助。２００８年北京奥运会火炬在达累斯萨拉姆传递过程中，坦桑尼亚人民像欢庆自己的节日一样，载歌载舞迎接奥运圣火，喜庆的画面深深定格在中国人民的脑海中。, 　　中国汶川特大地震发生后，非洲国家纷纷伸出援手，有的国家自己也不富裕、人口不到２００万，向地震灾区慷慨捐出２００万欧元，相当于人均１欧元，这份情谊让中国人民备感温暖。, 　　我们双方不断加强在国际和地区事务中的协调和配合，有力维护了发展中国家共同利益。中国人民和非洲人民的友谊和合作，已经成为中非关系的标志，在国际社会传为佳话。, 相关新闻:, 　　过去半个多世纪的共同努力及其产生的丰富成果，为我们继续推进中非关系打下了坚实基础、积累了宝贵经验。, 　　——这段历史告诉我们，中非关系不是一天就发展起来的，更不是什么人赐予的，而是我们双方风雨同舟、患难与共，一步一个脚印走出来的。饮水不忘挖井人。我们将永远铭记为中非关系发展披荆斩棘、呕心沥血的人们，不断从历史中汲取前进的动力。, 　　——这段历史告诉我们，中非从来都是命运共同体，共同的历史遭遇、共同的发展任务、共同的战略利益把我们紧紧联系在一起。我们都把对方的发展视为自己的机遇，都在积极通过加强合作促进共同发展繁荣。, 　　——这段历史告诉我们，中非关系的本质特征是真诚友好、相互尊重、平等互利、共同发展。我们双方谈得来，觉得相互平等；我们不把自己的意志强加给你们，你们也不把自己的意志强加给我们。中国为非洲发展提供了力所能及的帮助，中国更感谢非洲国家和非洲人民长期以来给予中国的大力支持和无私帮助，我们在事关对方核心利益的问题上，从来都是立场鲜明、毫不含糊地支持对方。, 　　——这段历史告诉我们，中非关系要保持旺盛生命力，必须与时俱进、开拓创新。半个多世纪以来，在中非关系发展的每一个关键时期，我们双方都能登高望远，找到中非合作新的契合点和增长点，推动中非关系实现新的跨越。这种逢山开路、遇水架桥的开拓精神，是我们不断提高中非合作水平的重要法宝。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　当前，中非关系正站在新的历史起点上，具备天时、地利、人和的优势。作为“希望的大陆”、“发展的热土”，今天的非洲已经成为全球经济增长最快的地区之一，非洲雄狮正在加速奔跑，而中国也继续保持着良好发展势头。中非合作基础更加坚实、合作意愿更加强烈、合作机制更加完善，推进中非合作是双方人民共同心愿，是大势所趋、人心所向。, 　　这里，我可以明确告诉各位朋友，新形势下，中非关系的重要性不是降低了而是提高了，双方共同利益不是减少了而是增多了，中方发展对非关系的力度不会削弱、只会加强。, 　　第一，对待非洲朋友，我们讲一个“真”字。真朋友最可贵。中非传统友谊弥足珍贵，值得倍加珍惜。我们始终把发展同非洲国家的团结合作作为中国对外政策的重要基础，这一点绝不会因为中国自身发展和国际地位提高而发生变化。中国坚持国家不分大小、强弱、贫富一律平等，秉持公道、伸张正义，反对以大欺小、以强凌弱、以富压贫，反对干涉别国内政，将继续同非方在涉及对方核心利益和重大关切的问题上相互支持，继续在国际和地区事务中坚定支持非洲国家的正义立场，维护发展中国家共同利益。中国将继续坚定支持非洲自主解决本地区问题的努力，为促进非洲和平与安全作出更大贡献。, 　　世界上没有放之四海而皆准的发展模式，各方应该尊重世界文明多样性和发展模式多样化。中国将继续坚定支持非洲国家探索适合本国国情的发展道路，加强同非洲国家在治国理政方面的经验交流，从各自的古老文明和发展实践中汲取智慧，促进中非共同发展繁荣。, 　　家和万事兴。全非洲是一个命运与共的大家庭。今年是非洲统一组织成立５０周年，对追求联合自强的非洲各国人民具有里程碑意义。中方真诚祝愿并坚定支持非洲在联合自强的道路上步子迈得更大一些，推动非洲和平与发展事业不断跨上新的台阶。, 　　中方希望中非关系发展得越来越好，也希望其他国家同非洲关系发展得越来越好。非洲是非洲人的非洲，任何国家发展同非洲关系，都应该尊重非洲的尊严和自主性。, 　　第二，开展对非合作，我们讲一个“实”字。中国不仅是合作共赢的倡导者，更是积极实践者。中国致力于把自身发展同非洲发展紧密联系起来，把中国人民利益同非洲人民利益紧密结合起来，把中国发展机遇同非洲发展机遇紧密融合起来，真诚希望非洲国家发展得更快一些，非洲人民日子过得更好一些。中国在谋求自身发展的同时，始终向非洲朋友提供力所能及的支持和帮助。特别是近些年来，中国加大了对非援助和合作力度。只要是中方作出的承诺，就一定会不折不扣落到实处。, 　　中国将继续扩大同非洲的投融资合作，落实好３年内向非洲提供２００亿美元贷款额度的承诺，实施好“非洲跨国跨区域基础设施建设合作伙伴关系”，加强同非洲国家在农业、制造业等领域的互利合作，帮助非洲国家把资源优势转化为发展优势，实现自主发展和可持续发展。, 　　授人以鱼，更要授人以渔。中方将积极实施“非洲人才计划”，未来３年将为非洲国家培训３万名各类人才，提供１．８万个奖学金留学生名额，加强对非洲技术转让和经验共享。, 　　随着中国经济实力和综合国力不断提高，中国将继续为非洲发展提供应有的、不附加任何政治条件的帮助。, 　　第三，加强中非友好，我们讲一个“亲”字。中国人民和非洲人民有着天然的亲近感。“人生乐在相知心。”中非如何知心？我以为，很重要的一点就是要通过深入对话和实际行动获得心与心的共鸣。, 　　中非关系的根基和血脉在人民，中非关系发展应该更多面向人民。近年来，随着中非关系发展，中非人民越走越近。一些非洲朋友活跃在中国文艺舞台上，成了中国家喻户晓的明星。中国电视剧《媳妇的美好时代》在坦桑尼亚热播，使坦桑尼亚观众了解到中国老百姓家庭生活的酸甜苦辣。, 　　我听说了一个故事，有一对中国年轻人，他们从小就通过电视节目认识了非洲，对非洲充满了向往。后来他们结婚了，把蜜月旅行目的地选在了坦桑尼亚。在婚后的第一个情人节，他们背上行囊来到了坦桑尼亚，领略了这里的风土人情和塞伦盖蒂草原的壮美。回国后，他们把在坦桑尼亚的所见所闻发布在博客上，得到了数万次的点击和数百条回复。他们说，我们真的爱上了非洲，我们的心从此再也离不开这片神奇的土地。这个故事说明，中非人民有着天然的亲近感，只要不断加强人民之间的交流，中非人民友谊就一定能根深叶茂。, 　　我们要更加重视中非人文交流，增进中非人民的相互了解和认知，厚植中非友好事业的社会基础。中非关系是面向未来的事业，需要一代又一代中非有志青年共同接续奋斗。双方应该积极推动青年交流，使中非友好事业后继有人，永葆青春和活力。, 　　第四，解决合作中的问题，我们讲一个“诚”字。中国和非洲都处在快速发展过程中，相互认知需要不断与时俱进。中方坦诚面对中非关系面临的新情况新问题，对出现的问题，我们应该本着相互尊重、合作共赢的精神加以妥善解决。, 　　我相信，机遇总比挑战大，办法总比困难多。中方已经并将继续同非洲国家一道，采取切实措施，妥善解决中非经贸合作中存在的问题，使非洲国家从合作中更多受益。同时，我们也真诚希望非洲国家为中国企业和公民在非洲开展合作提供相应的便利条件。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　新中国成立６０多年来特别是改革开放３０多年来，中国共产党领导中国人民成功开辟出中国特色社会主义道路，中国发展取得了历史性进步，经济总量已经跃升到世界第二位，综合国力显著增强，人民生活明显改善。作为有着１３亿多人口的国家，中国用几十年的时间走完了发达国家几百年走过的发展历程，这其中的艰辛和曲折是可想而知的。, 　　现在，中国基本国情仍然是人口多、底子薄、发展不平衡，经济总量虽大，但除以１３亿多人口，人均国内生产总值还排在世界第九十位左右。根据联合国标准，中国还有１．２８亿人生活在贫困线以下。让１３亿多人民都过上富裕的日子，仍然还有很长的路要走，还需要付出长期的艰苦努力。随着中国不断发展，中国人民生活水平必将不断提高。但是，无论中国发展到哪一步，中国永远都把非洲国家当作自己的患难之交。, 　　女士们、先生们！, 　　中国的发展离不开世界、离不开非洲，世界和非洲的繁荣稳定也需要中国。中非虽然远隔重洋，但我们的心是相通的。联结我们的不仅是深厚的传统友谊、密切的利益纽带，还有我们各自的梦想。, 　　１３亿多中国人民正致力于实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，１０亿多非洲人民正致力于实现联合自强、发展振兴的非洲梦。中非人民要加强团结合作、加强相互支持和帮助，努力实现我们各自的梦想。我们还要同国际社会一道，推动实现持久和平、共同繁荣的世界梦，为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 　　阿桑特尼萨那！, 　　注：, 　　哈巴里，Ｈａｂａｒｉ，斯瓦希里语，意为“大家好”。, 　　阿桑特尼萨那，Ａｓａｎｔｅｎｉｓａｎａ，斯瓦希里语，意为“谢谢大家”。, 　　（人民网达累斯萨拉姆3月25日电）  , ]",习近平：永远做可靠朋友和真诚伙伴,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/20911841
15,164,"[, on state visits to Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, to attend the eighth summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 in St. Petersburg, Russia, and to the head of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states in the capital of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan On the eve of the thirteenth meeting of the Association, President Xi Jinping accepted Turkmenistan’s Neutral Turkmenistan News, Russian Interfax News Agency, Kazakhstan’s News Agency, Kazakhstan’s Truth, Uzbekistan’s “Zahon” news agency, Kyrgyzstan's ""Review"" interviewed on China's bilateral relations with the five countries, G20 affairs, the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China's economic situation and other views and opinions. The full text is as follows: Q: How do you evaluate Turkmenistan's relationship with China, especially the energy cooperation between the two countries? What results do you expect from this visit? , Answer: China-Turkey friendly relations have a long history, and the trade and cultural exchanges on the ancient Silk Road have laid a solid foundation for the traditional friendship between the two countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Turkey in 1992, bilateral relations have made great progress. The bilateral trade volume reached a new record of 10.3 billion US dollars last year, which has increased more than 100 times in 7 years. The two sides maintain close communication and coordination in the affairs of the United Nations and Central Asia, effectively safeguarding the common strategic interests of the two countries. China is satisfied with the achievements made in China-Turkey relations. Energy cooperation is the highlight of China-Turkey relations and fully reflects the high level of political mutual trust between the two countries. The two countries have successfully implemented major cooperation projects such as natural gas trade and China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline construction. At present, the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline has been connected to the second West-East Gas Pipeline in China, making it the longest natural gas pipeline in the world today. The natural gas produced in Turkmenistan, the hinterland of Central Asia, spans thousands of mountains and waters and travels more than 8,000 kilometers directly to the Pacific coast. This is a model of world energy cooperation and the crystallization of friendship between the Chinese and Turkish peoples. China and Turkmenistan are important energy consumers and major energy producers in the world, respectively. Both sides have natural advantages and great potential for energy cooperation. China is willing to continue to cooperate with the Turkish side on the principles of equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, expand existing pipeline construction and natural gas trade, start all-round cooperation in exploration, mining, oil, gas and chemical industries, and become a long-term, stable and reliable energy strategic partner. At present, the Chinese people are struggling to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The people of Turkmenistan are also actively building an era of ""strong and happy"", and their respective national development strategies are highly compatible. , I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with President Berdymukhamedov on planning the third 10-year development of bilateral relations, coordinating the development strategies of the two countries, and achieving common prosperity, and making important decisions during my visit to Turkmenistan. I believe that through this visit, the two sides can achieve the expected goals of improving the overall level of China-Turkey relations, promoting large-scale projects and cooperation in key areas, and spreading the concept of friendship between China and Turkey for generations, injecting new and powerful impetus into the development of China-Turkey relations. , Q: How does China view the current slowdown in China's economic growth? What is the outlook for China's economy? Will China launch new measures to stabilize economic growth? , Answer: China's economic fundamentals are sound. China's GDP grew by 7.6% in the first half of this year. Compared with other countries, economic growth is at a high level. If we continue the previous development mode, we will have a higher growth rate. However, in terms of macroeconomic policy choices, we are unswervingly advancing economic restructuring and advancing economic transformation and upgrading. We prefer to take the initiative to slow down the growth rate, and we must fundamentally solve the problem of long-term economic development. Therefore, such a growth rate is the result of a benign adjustment. Specifically, in the growth of 7.6 percentage points, domestic demand contributed 7.5 points, and the current account surplus is already within an internationally recognized reasonable range. At the same time, we focus on improving social security policies, stabilizing and expanding employment, and achieved 7.25 million jobs in the first half of the year. We do face difficulties such as local government debt and overcapacity in some industries, but these problems are all within controllable limits, and we have the ability to handle them well. China is the second largest economy in the world, and the Chinese economy is highly integrated with the world economy. China's economic development has made important contributions to the world's economic recovery. For the world economy, a China with a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality, and more sustainable growth prospects is obviously good. We have the conditions to achieve sustained and healthy economic development, create a broader market and development space for all countries, and bring more positive spillover effects to the world economy. , Q: You will hold a bilateral meeting with President Putin during the G20 summit in St. Petersburg. What are your expectations for this meeting? How do you evaluate Russia for hosting the G20During the Petersburg summit, you will hold a bilateral meeting with President Putin. What are your expectations for this meeting? How do you evaluate Russia's work to host the G20 summit? A: I look forward to meeting with my old friend President Putin in St. Petersburg. I said during my visit to Russia in March this year that I hope that both sides will grasp the beautiful early spring season, work hard for the development of relations between the two countries, for world peace and development, and reap new achievements. It is gratifying that the two sides have actively implemented the various cooperation consensus and agreements reached by President Putin and Moscow in Moscow, and promoted the two countries' economic and trade, investment, energy, law enforcement and strategic security, military and military technology, local, humanities, international and other Cooperation in the field has achieved important results or positive progress. This time, my meeting with President Putin coincided with the golden autumn harvest season. Chunhuaqiushi, we will jointly summarize the achievements made in the development of bilateral relations since the meeting in March this year, plan the next stage of the development direction and goals of bilateral cooperation in various fields, and witness the signing of a series of new cooperation documents between the relevant departments and enterprises of the two countries. , I believe that the two sides will use this meeting as an opportunity to continue to take advantage of the high-level political relations between China and Russia, comprehensively deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields, and coordinate and coordinate closely in international affairs to develop better relations between the two countries and promote The two countries have developed and rejuvenated. As the chairman of the G20 this year, Russia actively coordinates its members, strengthens the role of the G20, and promotes the recovery of the world economy. It has done a lot of fruitful work to host this summit and fully demonstrated the role and influence of the great powers. Highly praised. The Chinese side fully supports the Russian side in holding this summit well. I believe that under the auspices of the Russian side and with the concerted efforts of all parties, the St. Petersburg Summit will surely achieve positive results and become an important part of the development process of the G20, gather consensus for the G20 cooperation, and seek ideas for global economic governance , Adding momentum to the growth of the world economy. , Q: The eighth summit of the leaders of the G20 will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia. What does China expect from this summit? , Answer: The summit of the G20 leaders in St. Petersburg will be held soon. This is an important meeting held by leaders of the world's major economies against the backdrop of insufficient growth momentum in the world economy and the deep-seated impact of the international financial crisis. China supports the St. Petersburg Summit on the theme of growth and employment, promotes the G20 to establish a closer partnership, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, and jointly create a better future for the world economy. , First, jointly adopt responsible macroeconomic policies. The first is to do well in one's own affairs, ensure that the national economy does not cause major problems, and strengthen economic competitiveness through active structural reforms. On this basis, all parties should strengthen policy coordination, bring positive and not negative spillover effects to each other, and jointly cope with the current major risks and challenges in the field of world economy and finance. Second, maintain and develop a more open world economy. Countries must stand against all forms of protectionism, promote the Doha Round negotiations to achieve early gains, and maintain a free, open, and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. Promote the deeper integration of the economies of all countries, jointly build a global value chain, avoid the division of the global market and the differentiation of the trading system, and achieve mutually beneficial and win-win development. , Third, improve global economic governance. The G20 will continue to work to improve the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries, especially to implement the IMF quota and governance reform plan as soon as possible, and complete the IMF quota on time in January 2014 Formula adjustments and a new round of total share inspections are scheduled to be reviewed in 2015 as part of the SDR currency basket. Fourth, be a development partner of developing countries. The G20 should give full play to its own advantages, embody stronger political will in promoting the resolution of global development issues, build a more effective global development partnership, mobilize more economic resources, and solve more development problems. , Q: Why can the G20 Leaders Summit play an important role in responding to the international financial crisis? Compared with other current international economic cooperation mechanisms, what are the characteristics of the G20? How does China view the role of the G20 in today's world? A: The members of the G20 include both developed and emerging market countries. The consultation among the members reflects the changes in the world economic structure and the general trend of international economic relations. After the international financial crisis in 2008, the G20 established its position as the ""main forum for international economic cooperation"", promoted the international community to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, introduced a series of major measures, and pushed the world economy out of the international financial crisis Shadow. At the same time, the G20 actively promoted the reform of the IMF’s share and the World Bank’s voting rights, and established a more representative financial stability council to support the World Trade Organization’s central role in the multilateral trading system.The reform of the voting rights of the world’s banks, the establishment of a more representative financial stability council, support the World Trade Organization to play a central role in the multilateral trading system, and made important contributions to the improvement of global economic governance. At present, the G20 is transforming from crisis response to long-term economic governance mechanism. As long as members continue to adhere to the spirit of partnership for mutual benefit and mutual benefit, and unswervingly strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, improve global economic governance, reform the international financial system, and promote global trade liberalization, the prospects for the G20 will be bright . , Q: How do you evaluate the current development level of Kazakhstan-China relations? What do you expect from the future development of relations between the two countries? How can the two countries achieve the goal of increasing bilateral trade volume to US$40 billion by 2015, and how will they cooperate in non-resource fields? As a comprehensive strategic partner, what are your views and suggestions on Kazakhstan-China cooperation in international and regional affairs? , A: China and Kazakhstan are friendly neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 21 years ago, the relations between the two countries have maintained healthy, rapid and stable development. Both sides regard the development of relations with each other as their foreign policy priority. It can be said that China-Kazakhstan relations are at the highest level in history, and the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries is facing unprecedented opportunities for development. , Continuously expanding and deepening pragmatic cooperation between China and Kazakhstan is of great significance for consolidating the material foundation of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. In recent years, the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has developed rapidly. China has become Kazakhstan's largest trading partner, and Kazakhstan is China's second largest trading partner in the CIS region. In order to further improve the level of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries, the two sides have set a strategic goal of increasing bilateral trade volume to US$40 billion in 2015. Of course, achieving the above goals will also depend on the joint efforts of both parties. The two countries should continue to pursue the principle of mutual benefit and win-win, and on the basis of maintaining good cooperation in the field of oil and gas, fully tap the potential for cooperation in non-resource fields such as agriculture, transportation, high technology, telecommunications, and chemical industries, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the fields of humanities and localities. Form a good situation in which the cooperation structure is focused and go hand in hand. I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Kazakhstan comprehensive and multi-practical cooperation in various fields will continue to reach a new level and bring more tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. Both China and Kazakhstan are developing countries and major influential countries. They have the same or similar positions in international and regional affairs and shoulder the heavy responsibility of maintaining regional and world peace, development and stability. As member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China and Kazakhstan actively cooperate within the framework of the organization, jointly fight against the ""three forces"" and other security threats, and promote cooperation in agriculture, finance, and connectivity. China is willing to work with Kazakhstan to make new and greater contributions to regional, world peace, stability and development. , Q: How do you evaluate the development of Uzbekistan-China relations? What kind of cooperation do you think Uzbekistan and China can carry out in reviving the Silk Road? , A: Uzbekistan is China's friendly neighbor and strategic partner. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 21 years ago, China-Ukraine relations have always maintained a healthy and stable development momentum. Cooperation in various fields has achieved fruitful results, and a large number of major cooperation projects that have benefited people's livelihood have been smoothly implemented. In 2012, the bilateral trade volume between China and Ukraine was 2.875 billion US dollars, which was more than 50 times that of the initial establishment of diplomatic relations. China has become Uzbekistan's second largest trading partner and largest source of investment. The China-Ukraine strategic partnership is glowing with vitality and vitality. China is willing to work with Uzbekistan, focusing on the long-term and the needs of the development of bilateral relations, and constantly push China-Ukraine strategic partnership to a new level. Both China and Ukraine have a long history and a splendid culture. More than 2000 years ago, the people of China and Uzbekistan jointly opened the Silk Road. Reviving the Silk Road is our common historical mission. China and Uzbekistan can make full use of the advantages of geographical proximity, economic complementarity, and close cultural and historical links, and actively carry out cooperation in the following areas: First, promote interconnection. China is willing to cooperate with Ukraine in railway, highway, aviation and transit transportation. The second is to expand the scale of trade and investment and improve the quality of economic and trade cooperation. The Chinese government supports more powerful Chinese-funded enterprises to invest in Ukraine and welcomes Uzbek enterprises to develop business in China. The third is to strengthen humanistic exchanges, tap the potential of tourism cooperation, and actively carry out academic exchanges, mutual visits between groups and groups, and cultural and artistic tours. , I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the modern silk road in various forms and rich in content will surely bring more benefits to the people of both countries. , Q: How do you view the current status and prospects of the development of Kyrgyzstan-China relations? What are your expectations for this visit to Kyrgyzstan? A: A few days ago, Kyrgyzstan had just celebrated its 22nd anniversary of independence. On this occasion, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the people of Kyrgyzstan. I wish the friendly Kyrgyzstan country prosperity and prosperity and the people happinessOn behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Kyrgyz people. I wish the friendly Kyrgyzstan country prosperity and prosperity and the people happiness and well-being. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, China-Kyrgyzstan relations have always maintained rapid and stable development. Cooperation in various fields has achieved remarkable results. Bilateral relations have reached an unprecedentedly high level and have broad development prospects. Adhering to the principles of mutual respect, equality, and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, the two sides have completely resolved the border issue left over from history, and made the 1100-km borderline a link that bonds the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples. Cooperation between the two countries in trade, energy, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture and other pragmatic fields continues to expand, and China has become Kyrgyzstan’s second largest trading partner and second largest source of investment. Both sides fully respect each other's development path chosen according to their own national conditions, firmly support each other on major issues involving each other's core interests, and work together in the face of international financial crises and major natural disasters. They are good neighbors and friends who trust each other. , China attaches great importance to relations with Kyrgyzstan, and relations between the two countries are facing major development opportunities. China is willing to work with Kyrgyzstan to continuously deepen political mutual trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and strengthen strategic cooperation to push the relationship between the two countries to a higher level. , I look forward to a state visit to Kyrgyzstan. During the visit, I will hold formal talks with President Atambayev to jointly plan the future development of bilateral relations and make major decisions. , I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, this visit will surely be a success and inject new and powerful impetus into the development of China-Kyrgyzstan relations. , Q: Security and economic cooperation are the main cooperation directions of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. How do you think the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should perform its security and economic functions in the next step? , Answer: In the 12 years since the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, member states have formed a close community of destiny and interest. Facing the complicated international and regional situation, maintaining regional security and stability and promoting the common development of member countries have been the primary tasks and goals of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for a long period of time in the past, present and future. In terms of security, member states should continue to firmly support each other's efforts to maintain national security and social stability, and increase efforts to combat ""three forces"" and drug crimes. It is worth noting that at present, the phenomenon of collusion between regional terrorism and drug crime is intensifying, and counter-terrorism and drug control have become two-pronged systems engineering. China believes that it is necessary to endow the Shanghai Cooperation Organization regional anti-terrorism organization with anti-drug functions and strengthen its comprehensive ability to combat ""drug-terrorism collusion."" Economically, member countries should vigorously promote pragmatic cooperation. Our ultimate goal of maintaining regional security and stability is to achieve common development and prosperity. It is necessary for all parties to accelerate the implementation of cooperation projects in the areas of transportation, energy, communications, agriculture and other advantageous fields, and step up research and establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Development Bank to solve project financing problems and respond to international financial risks. At the same time, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should continue to strengthen pragmatic cooperation with other multilateral mechanisms in the region to achieve complementary advantages. , China has always supported the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. For a long time, we have actively exchanged experience in law enforcement and security cooperation with member states. We provide preferential loans for economic cooperation among member countries, help member countries cultivate national construction talents, work together with member countries, and jointly cope with the impact of the international financial crisis. China will continue to work hand in hand with member states to create a better tomorrow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. , Q: The thirteenth meeting of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be held in Bishkek. What are your expectations and comments on this summit? What initiatives will you propose at the meeting? A: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, solid steps have been taken in political, security, economic, cultural and international cooperation, and international cooperation. It has played an important role in safeguarding the security and stability of the region and promoting common development, showing vigorous vitality. It has become the consensus of the member states to promote the faster and better development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the realization of common goals. There are two important backgrounds for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Bishkek Summit. First, new changes have taken place in the international and regional situations. The deep adjustment of the world economy, the continued turmoil in West Asia and North Africa, the Afghanistan issue is facing a new and complex situation, which brings new challenges to the security and stability of the region and the cooperation and development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. At the same time, emerging market economies present deeper development potential and broader prospects for cooperation, which brings new opportunities for the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Second, the ""Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization"" has come into effect, injecting new impetus for member states to further improve their cooperation, enhance their ability to respond to various threats and challenges, and accelerate the construction of a region of lasting peace and common prosperity. Therefore, this summit will plan and deploy the next phase of the work of the organization in light of the above-mentioned developments and changes. , I believe that to promote the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit and equalityPlan and deploy the next stage of work. , I believe that to promote the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and the pursuit of common development. To do a good job of the two constructions, one is to strengthen its own construction, improve its ""inner strengths"", and improve the efficiency and level of cooperation; the other is to strengthen the construction of partner networks, and earnestly promote cooperation with observers and dialogue partners, and seek common development plans for the region. Three practical things must be done, namely the tasks of maintaining safety, developing the economy, and improving people's livelihood as defined in the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Medium-Term Development Strategic Plan"" to benefit the people of the member states. At this summit, I will put forward China's views and suggestions on the above issues, and look forward to hearing the valuable opinions of my colleagues. It is believed that with the joint efforts of all member countries, the summit will achieve the expected results and open a new chapter for the development of the organization.

在对土库曼斯坦、哈萨克斯坦、乌兹别克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦进行国事访问，赴俄罗斯圣彼得堡出席二十国集团领导人第八次峰会，赴吉尔吉斯斯坦首都比什凯克出席上海合作组织成员国元首理事会第十三次会议前夕，国家主席习近平接受了土库曼斯坦《中立的土库曼斯坦报》、俄罗斯国际文传电讯社、哈萨克斯坦电讯社、《哈萨克斯坦真理报》、乌兹别克斯坦“扎洪”通讯社、吉尔吉斯斯坦《言论报》联合采访，就中国同五国双边关系、二十国集团事务、上海合作组织发展、中国经济形势等阐述了看法和主张。全文如下：, 问：您如何评价土库曼斯坦同中国的关系，特别是两国能源合作？您期待这次访问将取得哪些成果？, 答：中土友好关系源远流长，古丝绸之路上的商贸和文化交流为两国传统友谊奠定了深厚基础。中土1992年建交以来，双边关系获得长足发展。双边贸易额去年创下103亿美元的新纪录，7年内增长100多倍。双方在联合国和中亚事务中保持密切沟通和协调，有力维护了两国共同战略利益。中方对中土关系取得的成绩感到满意。, 能源合作是中土关系的亮点，充分体现了两国政治互信的高水平。两国成功实施了天然气贸易、中国—中亚天然气管道建设等重大合作项目。目前，中国—中亚天然气管道已经同中国境内的西气东输二线相连接，成为当今世界最长的天然气管道。产自中亚腹地土库曼斯坦的天然气跨越千山万水，行程8000多公里直抵太平洋沿岸，这是世界能源合作的典范和中土人民友谊的结晶。, 中国和土库曼斯坦分别是世界重要能源消费国和重要能源生产国，双方开展能源合作具有天然优势和巨大潜力。中方愿意同土方继续本着平等互利、合作共赢原则，扩大现有管道建设和天然气贸易，启动勘探、开采、油气化工等全方位合作，做长期、稳定、可靠的能源战略伙伴。, 当前，中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗，土库曼斯坦人民也在积极建设“强盛幸福”时代，双方各自的国家发展战略高度契合。, 我期待着访问土库曼斯坦期间同别尔德穆哈梅多夫总统就规划双边关系第三个10年发展、统筹两国发展战略、实现共同繁荣深入交换意见，并作出重要决定。我相信，通过这次访问，双方能够实现提高中土关系整体水平、推动大型项目和重点领域合作、传播中土世代友好理念的预期目标，为中土关系发展注入新的强大动力。, 问：中方怎么看目前中国经济增长有所放缓？中国经济前景如何？中国是否会推出稳定经济增长的新措施？, 答：中国经济基本面良好，今年上半年中国国内生产总值增长7.6%，与其他国家相比，经济增长处于高水平。如果我们继续以往的发展方式，我们会有更高的增长率。但是，在宏观经济政策选择上，我们坚定不移推进经济结构调整，推进经济转型升级，宁可主动将增长速度降下来一些，也要从根本上解决经济长远发展问题。因此，这样的增长速度，是良性调整的结果。, 具体说来，在7.6个百分点的增长中，内需贡献了7.5个点，经常账户盈余已经处于国际公认的合理区间。同时，我们注重完善社会保障政策，稳定和扩大就业，上半年实现了725万人就业。我们确实面临地方政府债务、部分行业产能过剩等困难，但这些问题都处于可控范围之内，我们有能力处理好。, 中国是世界第二大经济体，中国经济同世界经济高度融合。中国经济发展为世界经济复苏作出了重要贡献。对世界经济而言，一个经济运行更稳健、增长质量更高、增长前景更可持续的中国显然是利好的。我们有条件实现经济持续健康发展，为各国创造更广阔市场和发展空间，为世界经济带来更多正面外溢效应。, 问：二十国集团领导人圣彼得堡峰会期间您将同普京总统举行双边会晤，您对这次会晤有何期待？您如何评价俄罗斯为举办这次二十国集团领导人峰会所做的工作？, 答：我十分期待同我的老朋友普京总统在圣彼得堡举行会晤。我今年3月访问俄罗斯时讲过，希望双方把握美好的早春时节，为两国关系发展、为世界和平与发展辛勤耕耘，收获新的成果。, 令人高兴的是，双方积极落实我同普京总统在莫斯科达成的各项合作共识和协议，推动两国经贸、投资、能源、执法和战略安全、军事军技、地方、人文、国际等各领域合作都取得重要成果或积极进展。, 这次我同普京总统的会晤，恰逢金秋收获季节。春华秋实，我们将共同总结今年3月会晤以来两国关系发展取得的成果，规划下一阶段双方各领域合作发展方向和目标，见证两国有关部门和企业签署一系列新的合作文件。, 我相信，双方将以这次会晤为契机，继续发挥中俄高水平政治关系优势，全面深化各领域务实合作，密切在国际事务中的协调和配合，把两国关系发展得更好，推动两国发展振兴。, 作为今年二十国集团主席国，俄罗斯积极协调各成员，加强二十国集团作用，促进世界经济复苏，为举办这次峰会做了大量卓有成效的工作，充分展现了大国作用和影响，中方予以高度评价。, 中方全力支持俄方办好这次峰会。相信在俄方主持下，在各方一道努力下，圣彼得堡峰会一定会取得积极成果，成为二十国集团发展进程中的重要一环，为二十国集团合作聚共识，为全球经济治理谋思路，为世界经济增长添动力。, 问：二十国集团领导人第八次峰会即将在俄罗斯圣彼得堡举行，中方对这次峰会有何期待？, 答：二十国集团领导人圣彼得堡峰会即将举行。这是在世界经济增长动力不足、国际金融危机深层次影响不断显现的背景下，世界主要经济体领导人举行的一次重要会议。中方支持圣彼得堡峰会以增长和就业为主题，推动二十国集团建立更加紧密的伙伴关系，加强宏观经济政策协调，共同开创世界经济更加美好的未来。, 第一，共同采取负责任的宏观经济政策。首先是办好自己的事，确保本国经济不出大问题，并通过积极的结构改革增强经济竞争力。在此基础上，各方要加强政策协调，相互带来正面而非负面的外溢效应，共同应对当前世界经济金融领域重大风险和挑战。, 第二，维护和发展更加开放的世界经济。各国要旗帜鲜明反对各种形式的保护主义，推动多哈回合谈判达成早期收获，维护自由、开放、非歧视的多边贸易体系。推动各国经济加深融合，共同建设全球价值链，避免造成全球市场分割和贸易体系分化，实现互利共赢发展。, 第三，完善全球经济治理。二十国集团要继续致力于提高新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权，特别是要尽快落实国际货币基金组织份额和治理改革方案，并按时于2014年1月完成国际货币基金组织份额公式调整和新一轮份额总检查，如期于2015年审议特别提款权货币篮子组成。, 第四，做发展中国家的发展伙伴。二十国集团要充分发挥自身优势，在推动解决全球发展问题上体现更强的政治意愿，建设更加有效的全球发展伙伴关系，调动更多经济资源，破解更多发展难题。, 问：二十国集团领导人峰会为何能在应对国际金融危机中发挥重要作用？同当前其他国际经济合作机制相比，二十国集团有何特点？中方如何看待二十国集团在当今世界的作用？, 答：二十国集团成员既有发达国家，也有新兴市场国家，各成员一起协商，体现了世界经济格局变化和国际经济关系发展大趋势。, 2008年国际金融危机发生后，二十国集团确立了其作为“国际经济合作主要论坛”的定位，推动国际社会加强宏观经济政策协调，出台一系列重大举措，推动世界经济逐步走出国际金融危机的阴影。同时，二十国集团积极推动国际货币基金组织份额和世界银行投票权改革，成立更具代表性的金融稳定理事会，支持世界贸易组织在多边贸易体系中发挥核心作用，为完善全球经济治理作出了重要贡献。, 当前，二十国集团正从危机应对向长效经济治理机制转型。只要各成员继续坚持同舟共济、互利共赢的伙伴精神，坚定不移加强宏观经济政策协调、完善全球经济治理、改革国际金融体系、促进全球贸易自由化，二十国集团的前景就一定是光明的。, 问：您如何评价当前哈中关系发展水平？对两国关系未来发展有何期待？两国如何实现到2015年双边贸易额提高至400亿美元的目标，在非资源领域又将如何开展合作？作为全面战略伙伴，您对哈中在国际和地区事务中的合作有哪些看法和建议？, 答：中哈是友好邻邦和全面战略伙伴。建交21年来，两国关系保持健康快速稳定发展，双方都将发展同对方关系作为本国外交政策优先方向。可以说，中哈关系正处于历史最高水平，两国全面战略伙伴关系面临前所未有的发展机遇。, 不断扩大和深化中哈务实合作，对巩固两国全面战略伙伴关系的物质基础具有重要意义。近年来，两国经贸合作快速发展。中国已经成为哈萨克斯坦第一大贸易伙伴，哈萨克斯坦是中国在独联体地区的第二大贸易伙伴。为进一步提高两国务实合作水平，双方确定了2015年将双边贸易额提升至400亿美元的战略目标。, 当然，实现上述目标还要依靠双方一道努力。两国应该继续本着互利双赢原则，在保持油气领域良好合作的基础上，充分挖掘农业、交通运输、高技术、电信、化工等非资源领域合作潜力，同时加强人文、地方等领域交流合作，形成合作结构重点突出、齐头并进的良好局面。相信在双方共同努力下，中哈全方位、多领域的务实合作将不断迈上新台阶，给两国人民带来更多实实在在的利益。, 中哈同为发展中国家和有影响力的大国，在国际和地区事务中有着相同或相近立场，肩负着维护地区和世界和平、发展、稳定的重任。中哈作为上海合作组织成员国，积极在组织框架内开展合作，共同打击“三股势力”等安全威胁，推动农业、金融、互联互通等方面合作。中方愿同哈方一道努力，为地区和世界和平、稳定、发展作出新的更大的贡献。, 问：您如何评价乌兹别克斯坦同中国关系发展状况？您认为乌中在复兴丝绸之路方面可以开展哪些合作？, 答：乌兹别克斯坦是中国的友好近邻和战略伙伴。建交21年来，中乌关系始终保持健康稳定发展势头，各领域合作取得丰硕成果，顺利实施了一大批惠及民生的重大合作项目。2012年，中乌双边贸易额28.75亿美元，是建交初期的50多倍。中国已经成为乌兹别克斯坦第二大贸易伙伴国和第一大投资来源国。中乌战略伙伴关系正在焕发出蓬勃生机和强大活力。中方愿同乌方一道努力，着眼长远和两国关系发展需要，不断推动中乌战略伙伴关系迈上新台阶。, 中乌两国都拥有悠久历史和璀璨文化。2000多年前，中国和乌兹别克斯坦人民共同开辟了丝绸之路。复兴丝绸之路是我们肩负的共同历史使命。中乌两国可以充分发挥地理毗邻、经济互补、人文历史联系密切等优势，积极开展以下几个方面合作：一是推动互联互通。中方愿同乌方在铁路、公路、航空和过境运输等方面开展合作。二是扩大贸易和投资规模，提升经贸合作质量。中国政府支持更多有实力的中资企业赴乌投资兴业，也欢迎乌兹别克斯坦企业来华发展业务。三是加强人文交往，挖掘旅游合作潜力，积极开展学术交流、团组互访、文艺巡演等方面合作。, 我相信，在双方共同努力下，形式多样、内涵丰富的现代化丝绸之路必将为两国人民带来更多福祉。, 问：您如何看待吉尔吉斯斯坦同中国关系发展现状及前景？您对这次访问吉尔吉斯斯坦有何期待？, 答：几天前，吉尔吉斯斯坦刚刚庆祝了独立22周年。借此机会，我谨代表中国政府和人民，对吉尔吉斯人民表示热烈祝贺。祝愿友好的吉尔吉斯斯坦国家繁荣富强、人民幸福安康。, 1992年建交以来，中吉关系始终保持快速稳定发展，各领域合作成果显著，双边关系达到前所未有的高水平，发展前景广阔。双方秉持相互尊重、平等相待、互不干涉内政的原则，彻底解决了历史遗留下来的边界问题，使1100公里的边界线成为联结两国人民友谊和合作的纽带。两国贸易、能源、交通、电信、农业等务实领域合作不断扩大，中国已经成为吉尔吉斯斯坦第二大贸易伙伴国和第二大投资来源国。双方充分尊重对方根据本国国情选择的发展道路，在涉及彼此核心利益的重大问题上相互坚定支持，在遭受国际金融危机和重大自然灾害时同舟共济，是彼此信赖的好邻居、好朋友。, 中国高度重视对吉关系，两国关系面临重大发展机遇。中方愿同吉方一道努力，不断深化政治互信、扩大互利合作、加强战略协作，推动两国关系迈上新的更高的台阶。, 我期待着对吉尔吉斯斯坦进行国事访问。访问期间，我将同阿坦巴耶夫总统举行正式会谈，共同规划两国关系未来发展，并作出重大决定。, 我相信，在双方共同努力下，这次访问一定能够取得成功，为中吉两国关系发展注入新的强劲动力。, 问：安全和经济合作是上海合作组织的最主要合作方向。请问您认为上海合作组织下一步应该如何更好履行安全和经济两方面职能？, 答：上海合作组织成立12年来，成员国结成紧密的命运共同体和利益共同体。面对复杂的国际和地区形势，维护地区安全稳定和促进成员国共同发展，过去、现在乃至将来相当长时期内都是上海合作组织的首要任务和目标。, 安全上，成员国要继续坚定支持彼此维护国家安全和社会稳定的努力，加大打击“三股势力”和毒品犯罪力度。值得注意的是，当前，地区恐怖主义和毒品犯罪相互勾结的现象愈演愈烈，反恐和禁毒成为需要双管齐下的系统工程。中方认为有必要赋予上海合作组织地区反恐怖机构禁毒职能，加强其综合打击“毒恐勾结”的能力。, 经济上，成员国要大力推动务实合作。我们维护地区安全稳定的最终目的是实现共同发展繁荣。各方有必要加快实施交通、能源、通信、农业等优势领域合作项目，加紧研究建立上海合作组织开发银行，以解决项目融资难题和应对国际金融风险。同时，上海合作组织要不断加强同本地区其他多边机制的务实合作，以实现优势互补。, 中国始终支持上海合作组织发展。长期以来，我们同成员国积极交流执法安全合作经验。我们为成员国经济合作提供优惠贷款，帮助成员国培养国家建设人才，同成员国同舟共济，共同应对国际金融危机冲击。中方将继续同成员国携手并肩，一道创造上海合作组织的美好明天。, 问：上海合作组织成员国元首理事会第十三次会议即将在比什凯克举行。您对本次峰会有何期待和评价？您在会上将提出哪些倡议？, 答：上海合作组织成立以来，政治、安全、经济、人文合作和国际合作迈出坚实步伐，为维护本地区安全稳定、促进共同发展发挥了重要作用，显示出勃勃生机。推动上海合作组织更快更好发展，促进共同目标实现，已经成为成员国共识。, 上海合作组织比什凯克峰会的举行有两个重要背景。一是国际和地区形势发生新变化。世界经济深度调整，西亚北非局势持续动荡，阿富汗问题面临新的复杂形势，给本地区安全稳定、上海合作组织合作和发展带来新挑战。同时，新兴市场经济体呈现出更为深厚的发展潜力和更为广阔的合作前景，这给上海合作组织发展带来新机遇。二是《上海合作组织成员国长期睦邻友好合作条约》正式生效，为成员国进一步提高合作水平，增强应对各种威胁和挑战的能力，加快建设持久和平、共同繁荣的地区注入新动力。因此，这次峰会将结合上述形势发展变化，对本组织下一阶段工作作出规划和部署。, 我认为，推动上海合作组织发展要继续发扬一种精神，即互信、互利、平等、协商、尊重多样文明、谋求共同发展的“上海精神”。要搞好两个建设，一是加强自身建设，练好“内功”，提升合作效率和水平；二是加强伙伴网络建设，切实推进同观察员、对话伙伴合作，共谋地区发展大计。要办好三件实事，即《上海合作组织中期发展战略规划》所确定的维护安全、发展经济、改善民生的任务，造福成员国人民。, 在本次峰会上，我将就上述问题提出中方看法和倡议，也期待听到同事们的宝贵意见。相信在全体成员国共同努力下，峰会将取得预期成果，为本组织发展揭开崭新篇章。（新华社北京9月3日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2013年09月04日 02 版）, ]",习近平接受土、俄、哈、乌、吉五国媒体联合采访,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/22798385

During the visit and the meeting, I will exchange views with the leaders of the visiting countries and the leaders of the BRICS countries on the development of bilateral relations and international and regional issues of common concern, and on strengthening cooperation among the BRICS countries. I hope that through this visit, we will enhance the friendly feelings of the Chinese people with the people of the countries visited, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries, and push the BRICS cooperation mechanism to a new level. I believe that with the joint efforts of all parties, this visit and the fifth meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries will surely be successful. , Russia-Tass News Agency and Russian National Radio and Television Corporation reporter: Russia is the first country you visit as the president of the country. What are your considerations for making this decision? How do you evaluate the development level of the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation between Russia and China, as well as the current status and prospects of cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields? We know that you know a lot about Russia and have read many Russian books. How do you view Russia? , Xi Jinping: China and Russia are each other’s most important and most important strategic cooperation partners, and the relationship between the two countries occupies a priority in their overall diplomatic and foreign policies. My visit to the friendly neighboring Russia as soon as I became the President of the People's Republic of China exemplified China's high regard for Sino-Russian relations and the high level and particularity of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation. After more than 20 years of unremitting efforts by both parties, Sino-Russian relations have developed into a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation. The two sides have completely resolved the border issues left over from history. The political relationship is firmly established and they support each other on issues involving the core interests of the two countries. The bilateral trade volume has increased 14 times in 20 years, reaching a record 88.2 billion US dollars last year. Energy, investment Cooperation in strategic large-scale projects in the fields of aviation, aerospace and other fields is booming; humanistic exchanges and personnel exchanges are flourishing; the strategic cooperation between the two sides on the international stage is closer, and the process of democratization of international relations has been promoted. Sino-Russian relations have entered a new stage of providing each other with important development opportunities and being each other's main priority partners. In developing bilateral relations and handling major international and regional issues, our two countries have many points of cooperation and many opportunities for win-win cooperation. In the coming period, the main tasks of developing Sino-Russian relations will be to consolidate strategic and political mutual trust and enhance mutual support on issues involving the other party’s core interests; second, to expand pragmatic cooperation, including the early realization of bilateral trade volume reaching USD 100 billion in 2015 The goal is to establish energy strategic cooperation relations, carry out strategic large-scale project cooperation, and deepen humanities exchanges and cooperation; third, closely coordinate and cooperate in international and regional affairs, firmly uphold the purposes of the UN Charter and basic principles of international relations, and maintain the results of World War II. The post-war international order maintains world peace, security and stability. In short, China and Russia are confident and capable of transforming their high-level political relations advantages into practical results of pragmatic cooperation for the benefit of the two peoples. The people of China and Russia have a long tradition of friendship and a solid foundation for humanistic exchanges. When I was young, I saw many works by Russian writers, like Pushkin, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Nekrasov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Sholoho Husband, their books have a profound influence on us.Tov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Nekrasov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Sholokhov, and their books have a profound influence on us. The Chinese people have deep feelings for the Russian people. , I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with President Putin and other Russian leaders on further developing bilateral relations during my visit to Russia. I have met with President Putin in the past, he attaches great importance to relations with China, we can talk very well, and still have a fresh memory. Reporter from South African Satellite TV: You visited South Africa in 2010, and China has established diplomatic relations with South Africa for 15 years. How would you rate the development of bilateral relations? What do you expect from the prospects for cooperation between the two countries? , Xi Jinping: I visited South Africa in November 2010 and had a very good meeting with President Zuma. I co-chaired the mechanism dialogue of the National Bilateral Committee with Vice President Motlanti. The enthusiasm and friendship of the South African people left a deep impression on me impression. The Chinese people and the South African people have a profound friendship. As early as the struggle of the South African people against apartheid, the Chinese people stood firmly with the South African people. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 15 years ago, China-South Africa relations have achieved a historic leap from partnership to comprehensive strategic partnership. Both sides have deepened cooperation in various fields and achieved fruitful results. Both China and South Africa are emerging market countries and developing countries, and they regard each other as their own development opportunities and an important fulcrum of their foreign strategy. The breadth and depth of cooperation between China and South Africa in various fields are constantly expanding, and cooperation between the two sides is increasingly of strategic significance and global significance. At present, South Africa has taken over as the co-chair of the African side of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum and will soon serve as the rotating chairman of the BRICS mechanism, which has created favorable conditions for the two countries to deepen cooperation in African and international affairs. , I look forward to an in-depth exchange of views with President Zuma on the further development of relations between the two countries during my visit to South Africa, and I wish the BRICS leaders a successful fifth meeting. , South Africa Satellite TV reporter: The friendly relations between the Chinese and African people have a long history. How do you evaluate China's role and influence in Africa? What role will China play in the process of peace and development in Africa? In addition to resources, what other areas in China is China interested in? , Xi Jinping: Central African family. Chinese people of my age grew up in the warm atmosphere of China-Africa friendship since childhood. They have a strong interest in Africa. They are familiar with the names of the leaders of some older generations in African countries and are familiar with the Tanzania-Zambia Railway and other Sino-African friendship stories. China and Africa are both developing countries and share broad common interests. In recent years, China-Africa relations have developed tremendously on the basis of traditional friendship. While committing itself to its own development, China has always provided assistance within its capacity for African peace and development, and spoke to African countries in international affairs. China-Africa cooperation has spurred the improvement of Africa's international status and urged the international community to increase its attention and investment in Africa. In the future, no matter how the international situation changes, China will continue to be a supporter and promoter of African peace and stability, prosperity and development, unity and self-reliance, and equal participation in international affairs. , China sincerely appreciates and will always remember the friendly feelings of African friends towards the Chinese people, especially their firm support and valuable help on issues involving China's core interests and major concerns. When the torch of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games was passed to Dar es Salaam, the ""city of peace"", the people of Tanzania were singing and dancing like celebrating their own festivals. After a strong earthquake in Yushu, Qinghai, China in 2010, the Republic of Congo assisted in the construction of a primary school for the disaster area. President Sassou personally named it the Sino-Gangan Friendship Primary School, which shows the profound friendship of the people of the Republic of Congo towards the Chinese people. There are many such touching stories. , ""The soil is the mountain, and the water is the sea."" As long as we persist in advancing China-Africa cooperation, we will surely continue to achieve greater results. I want to point out that China-Africa cooperation is all-round cooperation. China attaches great importance to developing friendly relations with all African countries, regardless of size, strength, wealth and wealth. Regardless of whether it is a resource-rich country or a resource-poor country, China treats each other equally, and actively develops mutually beneficial and win-win pragmatic cooperation. We will pay close attention to the achievements of the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and promote the comprehensive and balanced development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the people of China and Africa. , Indian Press Trust: China and India have a long history of exchanges. What kind of policy will the new Chinese leadership pursue towards India? Will China's position on resolving the China-India boundary issue change? How will China and India strengthen cooperation in bilateral and international affairs? , Xi Jinping: China and India have traditional friendly relations and are also the two largest developing countries. The combined population of the two countries exceeds 2.5 billion. It is the common interests of the two countries that China and India take the path of peaceful development and cooperative development together. It is also a good thing for Asia and the world. , In May 2010, I had a very good meeting with President Patil who visited China. At that time, we all said that we must give full play to the great potential of cooperation between the two countries and promote the new relationship between China and India.President Patil who visited China had a good meeting. At that time, we all said that we must give full play to the great potential of cooperation between the two countries and promote the development of China-India relations to a new and higher level. In recent years, with the joint efforts of both sides, China-India relations have developed greatly, and the friendly way of dealing with differences properly and seeking common development has been deepened. China regards China-India relations as one of the most important bilateral relations and is committed to promoting the continuous development of China-India strategic cooperative partnership. At present, both China and India are accelerating development, which provides more opportunities for the two countries to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides should seize the opportunity, solidly promote exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and raise China-India relations to a new level. One is to maintain strategic communication and grasp the general direction of the development of bilateral relations. The second is to take advantage of complementary advantages and expand mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as infrastructure construction and mutual investment. The third is to strengthen cultural bonds and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. The fourth is to expand coordination and cooperation in the multilateral field, jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, and jointly address global issues. The fifth is to take care of the other party’s core concerns and properly handle the problems and differences between the two countries. The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex issue left over from history, and it is not easy to solve. As long as we persist in friendly consultations, we can eventually find a fair and reasonable solution acceptable to both parties. Before the final settlement of the border issue, the two sides should jointly safeguard the border area and peace and tranquility so as not to affect the overall development of the relationship between the two countries. , Brazil's ""Economic Value"" reporter: How do you evaluate the current China-Pakistan relations? What is China's vision for strengthening economic and trade cooperation between the two countries? Will it import more high value-added products from Brazil? , Xi Jinping: My last visit to Brazil was in February 2009, and I held very good talks with President Lula. President Lula later visited China, and I met him again. I care about President Lula's health and wish him good health. China and Brazil are the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres, and they are also emerging market countries. China has always attached importance to developing friendly cooperation with Brazil. Twenty years ago, Brazil became the first developing country to establish a strategic partnership with China. Over the past 20 years, China-Pakistan relations have developed tremendously, bringing tremendous benefits to the two countries and peoples, providing opportunities for their respective developments, and contributing to the development of the international order and international system in a more just and reasonable direction. At present, China-Pakistan relations are at the best level in history, and their strategic and overall importance is becoming increasingly prominent. During the upcoming fifth meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries, I will hold a bilateral meeting with President Rousseff. I look forward to a candid exchange of views with President Rousseff on the promotion of broader and deeper development of China-Pakistan relations. , Economic and trade cooperation is the material basis of China-Pakistan relations. At present, China is Brazil's largest trading partner, and Brazil is China's tenth largest trading partner. The development interests of the two countries have never been so closely connected as they are today. The bilateral economic and trade cooperation has continuously enhanced the role of the two countries in developing their economies and improving people's livelihood. China is willing to further tap the potential of economic complementarity between the two countries, optimize the trade structure, and expand cooperation areas. The two sides can also give full play to their respective advantages, promote the industrial connection between the two countries, innovate cooperation models, and improve the overall level of economic and trade cooperation. , I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries will be able to continuously make new breakthroughs in scale and level, which will not only promote the better realization of sustainable development of the two countries, but also help the two countries to adapt to the new situation of economic globalization and in-depth development. 1. The ability to resist international economic risks. , Indian Press Trust: How do you view the impact of the rise of emerging market countries and developing countries represented by the BRICS countries on the existing world landscape and global governance system? , Xi Jinping: At present, the rapid economic development of a large number of emerging market countries and developing countries, including the BRICS countries, has become an important force for maintaining world peace and promoting common development, and has played a role in coping with the international financial crisis and promoting global economic growth. Played an important role. This conforms to the trend of the times for peace, development, cooperation and a win-win situation. The global economic governance system must reflect the profound changes in the world economic structure and increase the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. In recent years, the G20 Leaders Summit has played an important role, and the IMF and the World Bank have carried out share reforms. This is an important step in the right direction of the reform of the global economic governance system. Emerging market countries and developing countries hope that the global economic governance system is more complete, more in line with the development requirements of the world’s productive forces, and more conducive to the common development of all countries in the world. , Xinhua News Agency reporter: How do you evaluate the current level of cooperation among BRICS countries? What do you expect from this meeting of the BRICS leaders in Durban? , Xi Jinping: BRICS cooperation is conducive to promoting a more balanced world economy, improved global economic governance, and more democratic international relations. , China looks forward to the meetingPing: Cooperation among BRICS countries is conducive to promoting a more balanced world economy, better global economic governance, and more democratic international relations. China looks forward to the meeting to deepen the BRICS partnership, improve the BRICS cooperation mechanism, strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various fields, tap the potential for pragmatic cooperation, and deliver positive messages of solidarity, cooperation and win-win to the international community. China supports the South African presidency to include the establishment of the BRICS Development Bank, the Foreign Exchange Reserve Bank, the Business Council, the Think Tank Council, etc. in the focus of preparations for the meeting, and looks forward to the meeting achieving positive results in these areas. During the meeting in Durban, a dialogue meeting between BRICS and African leaders will also be held. China supports the BRICS countries to strengthen dialogue and exchanges with Africa, build partnerships, safeguard common interests and achieve common development. , Russia-Tass News Agency and Russian National Radio and Television Corporation reporter: Looking ahead, what role will the Chinese Communist Party play in the historical process of China's development? Will new steps be taken in advancing reform? Will there be further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics? , Xi Jinping: The Chinese Communist Party is in power in China to lead the people to build the country better and make people live better. As I said, ironing needs to be hard. To shoulder this mission, the Communist Party of China must strengthen its own construction, maintain its advanced nature and purity, maintain the flesh-and-blood ties with the people, continuously improve its leadership and governance, and continuously improve its ability to resist corruption, resist risks, and resist risks. Continuously improve the level of scientific governance, democratic governance, and legal governance, and better serve the people. Reform and opening up is a distinctive symbol and source of vitality in contemporary China, and the only way to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. Without reform and opening up, there would be no China today, and no better future for China. I have emphasized many times that reform and opening up can only be carried out when it is not completed; contradictions in reform and opening up can only be resolved by reform and opening up. Under the new historical conditions, if we want to create a new situation for development, we must achieve new breakthroughs in reform. We will strengthen the top-level design and overall planning of the reform, coordinate and advance the economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and other aspects of system reform, dare to eat hard bones, dare to involve dangerous beaches, and resolutely eliminate all the shortcomings of institutional mechanisms that hinder scientific development and stimulate the whole society. Create vitality and promote the development of various national undertakings. , We believe that just as there is no exactly the same two leaves on a big tree, there is no one-size-fits-all experience in the world, and there is no set pattern for development. Socialism with Chinese characteristics will definitely continue to develop and improve. The world is changing, and China is changing. Socialism with Chinese characteristics must also move forward with changes in the situation and conditions. Only by constantly advancing with the times can China be full of vitality. We are willing to learn from all the achievements of human civilization, but we will not copy the development model of any country. China's reform is the self-improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. Only by taking the path chosen by the Chinese people themselves and the path that suits China's national conditions can they finally be able to pass through well. , Xinhua News Agency: China's economic strength has ranked second in the world. What changes will this bring to China's relationship with the outside world? You recently elaborated the ""Chinese dream"" to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. What is China's ""world dream""? , Xi Jinping: After more than 30 years of reform and opening up, China's economic and social development has achieved tremendous achievements, and people's living standards have improved significantly. This benefits both China and the world. The Chinese are patriotic, and we also have an international vision and an international mind. As the national strength continues to increase, China will assume more international responsibilities and obligations within its capacity and make greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development. It should be pointed out that although China's economic aggregate has ranked second in the world, there is still a large gap between the per capita GDP and the world average, and there is still a long way to go to achieve prosperity and prosperity. Now, some people in the world worry whether China will also engage in hegemonism and bully others after its development. This worry is completely unnecessary. China has repeatedly solemnly promised to the international community that China will firmly move along the path of peaceful development, never seek hegemony, and never engage in expansion. ""The gentleman is hard to chase after a word."" Our words are counted, and practice has proved that China has done what it says. We also hope that all countries in the world will follow the path of peaceful development and work together to promote world peace and development. The realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation since modern times. After the Opium War of 1840, the Chinese nation suffered a hundred years of foreign invasion and internal war. The Chinese people suffered great disasters and pains. They really suffered terribly and suffered a lot. The Chinese people sincerely support the realization of the Chinese dream, because the Chinese dream is first and foremost the common dream of the 1.3 billion Chinese people. , The Chinese have dominated since ancient timesDumbfounded. The Chinese people sincerely support the realization of the Chinese dream, because the Chinese dream is first and foremost the common dream of the 1.3 billion Chinese people. The Chinese have advocated harmony and differed since ancient times. We hope that between countries and between different civilizations, we can communicate on an equal basis, learn from each other, and make progress together. People of all countries can share the achievements of world economic and technological development, the wishes of people of all countries can be respected, and all countries can work together to promote sustainable development. A harmonious world of peace and common prosperity. , Brazil's ""Economic Value"" reporter: You are a Chinese leader, the outside world is eager to know more about you. For example, what do you think of leading a large country with a population of 1.3 billion? What is your daily work and life situation? How much time can you spend with your family? Can you introduce your personal experience and hobbies? Brazil will host the World Cup football next year. Which team do you predict to win? , Xi Jinping: When I met the leaders of some countries, they said with emotion, how can a country as big as China govern? Indeed, China has a population of 1.3 billion, and governance is not easy. It is not easy to understand the situation. I often say that it takes some effort to understand China. It is not enough to look at one or two places. China has 9.6 million square kilometers, 56 ethnic groups, and a population of 1.3 billion. It is important for China to avoid ""blind people touching the elephant"". , There is an old saying in China, ""Prince Prime Minister must start from the State Department, and must be sent to the soldiers."" Our current cadre selection mechanism is also level-one. For example, I have worked in rural areas, served as party branch secretary of the brigade, and worked in counties, cities, provinces, and the central government. With rich grass-roots experience, cadres can better establish the views of the masses, know the national conditions, and know what the people need, and constantly accumulate experience and professional knowledge in various fields in practice, and enhance work capabilities and talents. This is the basic condition for doing a good job. People have a lot of work to do in terms of clothing, food, housing and transportation, the daily operation of society, the normal operation of state machinery, and the construction and management of the ruling party. For me, when the people put me on such a job, they should always put the people at the highest position in their hearts, keep in mind the people’s trust and the responsibility is more important than Mount Tai. Such a big country, so many people, and such complicated national conditions, leaders must have a deep understanding of the national conditions, understand the people's expectations and expectations, have the consciousness of ""following thin ice, like the abyss"", and ""ruling a big country like cooking small"" He has no daring to slack off, no daring to be sloppy, and must work in public and diligently at night. The people are the source of our strength. As long as we are willing to work together with the people and work in solidarity with the people, there will be no insurmountable difficulties and no tasks that cannot be completed. As for the workload, you can imagine. There is basically no time for such a position. Work is confusing. Of course, I will prioritize. ""Everyone collects firewood with high flames."" We have a central collective leadership that has both division of labor and collaboration, and has a relatively effective working mechanism. Everyone bears their responsibilities and works together to do a good job. Although I am busy with my work, I ""stolen my life for half a day."" As long as I have time, I will be with my family. , I have many hobbies, my biggest hobby is reading, reading has become a way of life for me. I am also a sports enthusiast, I like swimming, mountain climbing and other sports, when I was young, I like football and volleyball. Brazil holds the World Cup again, and I congratulate you. The charm of sports competitions, especially football matches, is unpredictable. There was an octopus Paul in the last World Cup. I wonder if there will be an octopus that can predict the future next year? The Brazilian football team has a home advantage, and I wish the Brazilian team good luck.

3月19日，中国国家主席习近平在北京人民大会堂接受俄罗斯俄通－塔斯社、俄罗斯全国广播电视公司、南非卫星电视五台、印度报业托拉斯、巴西《经济价值报》和中国新华社记者联合采访。新华社记者兰红光摄, , 3月19日，国家主席习近平在北京人民大会堂接受俄罗斯俄通－塔斯社、俄罗斯全国广播电视公司、南非卫星电视五台、印度报业托拉斯、巴西《经济价值报》和中国新华社记者联合采访。新华社记者兰红光摄, 在对俄罗斯、坦桑尼亚、南非、刚果共和国进行国事访问并出席金砖国家领导人第五次会晤前夕，国家主席习近平１９日在人民大会堂接受了俄罗斯俄通—塔斯社、俄罗斯全国广播电视公司、南非卫星电视五台、印度报业托拉斯、巴西《经济价值报》和中国新华社记者的联合采访，就中国同有关国家双边关系、中非关系、金砖国家合作、中国改革开放等问题阐述了政策主张。全文如下：, 习近平：我将启程对俄罗斯、坦桑尼亚、南非、刚果共和国进行国事访问，并出席在南非举行的金砖国家领导人第五次会晤。, 出访前夕，有机会接受金砖国家媒体联合采访，我感到十分高兴。借此机会，我愿通过你们，向你们各自国家的人民致以诚挚的问候！, 这是我就任中国国家主席后的首次出访。访问和与会期间，我将同往访国领导人和金砖国家领导人就发展双边关系及共同关心的国际和地区问题、加强金砖国家合作交换意见。我希望通过这次访问，增进中国人民同往访国人民的友好感情，加强同各国的互利合作，推动金砖合作机制迈上新台阶。我相信，在各方共同努力下，这次访问和金砖国家领导人第五次会晤一定会取得成功。, 俄通—塔斯社和俄罗斯全国广播电视公司记者：俄罗斯是您以国家主席身份访问的第一个国家，您作出这一决定的考虑是什么？您如何评价俄中全面战略协作伙伴关系的发展水平以及两国在政治、经济、文化等领域的合作现状和前景？我们知道您对俄罗斯有很多了解，读过很多俄罗斯著作，您是如何看待俄罗斯的？, 习近平：中俄互为最主要、最重要的战略协作伙伴，两国关系在各自外交全局和对外政策中都占据优先地位。我就任国家主席后即出访友好邻邦俄罗斯，体现了中方对中俄关系的高度重视，也体现了中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系的高水平和特殊性。, 经过双方２０多年不懈努力，中俄关系发展成为全面战略协作伙伴关系。双方彻底解决了历史遗留的边界问题，政治关系基础牢固，在涉及两国核心利益的问题上相互支持；双边贸易额在２０年里增长１４倍，去年达到创纪录的８８２亿美元，能源、投资、航空航天等领域战略性大项目合作方兴未艾；人文交流和人员往来蓬勃发展；双方在国际舞台上的战略协作更加密切，推动了国际关系民主化进程。, 中俄关系已进入互相提供重要发展机遇、互为主要优先合作伙伴的新阶段。在发展双边关系和处理重大国际和地区问题上，我们两国契合点很多，合作共赢机会很多。今后一个时期，发展中俄关系的主要任务，一是巩固战略和政治互信，增强在涉及对方核心利益问题上的相互支持；二是扩大务实合作，包括提前实现双边贸易额２０１５年达到１０００亿美元的目标，建立能源战略合作关系，开展战略性大项目合作，深化人文交流合作；三是密切在国际和地区事务中的协调和配合，坚定维护联合国宪章宗旨和国际关系基本准则，维护二战成果和战后国际秩序，维护世界和平、安全、稳定。总之，中俄两国有信心有能力把双方高水平的政治关系优势转化为务实合作的实际成果，造福两国人民。, 中俄两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊，人文交流基础深厚。我年轻时就看过很多俄罗斯作家的作品，像普希金、莱蒙托夫、屠格涅夫、陀思妥耶夫斯基、涅克拉索夫、托尔斯泰、契诃夫、肖洛霍夫，他们的书对我们有很深的影响。中国人民对俄罗斯人民怀有深厚的感情。, 我期待着访俄期间同普京总统和其他俄方领导人就进一步发展两国关系深入交换意见。我过去同普京总统见过面，他高度重视对华关系，我们很谈得来，至今记忆犹新。, 南非卫星电视五台记者：您曾在２０１０年访问南非，中国同南非建交１５年了，您如何评价两国关系发展水平？对两国合作前景有何期待？, 习近平：我２０１０年１１月访问了南非，同祖马总统举行了很好的会见，与莫特兰蒂副总统共同主持国家双边委员会机制对话，南非人民的热情和友谊给我留下了深刻印象。, 中国人民和南非人民有着深厚友谊。早在南非人民反对种族隔离制度的斗争中，中国人民就坚定同南非人民站在一起。建交１５年来，中南关系实现了从伙伴关系到全面战略伙伴关系的历史性跨越，双方各领域合作日益深化、成果丰硕。, 中南同为新兴市场国家和发展中国家，都把对方视为自己的发展机遇和对外战略的重要支点。中南各领域合作的广度和深度在不断拓展，双方合作越来越具有战略影响和全球意义。目前，南非已接任中非合作论坛非方共同主席国，并即将担任金砖国家机制轮值主席国，这为两国深化在非洲和国际事务中的合作创造了有利条件。, 我期待着访问南非期间同祖马总统就进一步发展两国关系深入交换意见，预祝金砖国家领导人第五次会晤取得成功。, 南非卫星电视五台记者：中国和非洲人民友好关系源远流长。您如何评价中国在非洲的作用和影响？中国在非洲和平发展进程中将发挥什么作用？除资源外，中国还对非洲哪些领域感兴趣？, 习近平：中非一家亲。我这个年纪的中国人，从小就是在中非友好的热烈气氛中长大的，对非洲有很浓厚的兴趣，熟知一些非洲国家老一代领导人的名字，熟知坦赞铁路等中非友好佳话。, 中非同属发展中国家，有着广泛共同利益。近年来，中非关系在传统友好的基础上得到长足发展。中国在致力于自身发展的同时，一直为非洲和平与发展提供力所能及的帮助，在国际事务中为非洲国家说话。中非合作带动了非洲国际地位的提高，并推动国际社会加大对非关注和投入。今后，无论国际风云如何变幻，中国都会一如既往做非洲和平稳定、繁荣发展、联合自强、平等参与国际事务的支持者和促进者。, 中国衷心感谢并将永远铭记非洲朋友对中国人民的友好感情，特别是在涉及中国核心利益和重大关切问题上所给予的坚定支持和宝贵帮助。２００８年北京奥运会圣火传递到“和平之城”达累斯萨拉姆时，坦桑尼亚人民像庆祝自己的节日一样载歌载舞。２０１０年中国青海玉树发生强烈地震后，刚果共和国为灾区援建了一所小学，萨苏总统亲自将其命名为中刚友谊小学，显示了刚果共和国人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。这样的感人故事还有很多。, “积土为山，积水为海。”只要我们坚持不懈推进中非合作，就一定能不断取得更大成果。我想指出，中非合作是全方位合作。中国重视同所有非洲国家发展友好关系，无论大小、强弱、贫富。不管是资源富集国还是资源贫瘠国，中国都平等相待，积极开展互利共赢的务实合作。我们将抓紧落实中非合作论坛第五届部长级会议成果，推动双方关系全面均衡向前发展，造福中非人民。, 印度报业托拉斯记者：中印两国有着悠久的交往。中国新领导层对印度将奉行什么样的政策？中方在解决中印边界问题上的立场是否会有变化？在双边和国际事务中，中印将如何加强合作？, 习近平：中国和印度有着传统友好关系，也是两个最大的发展中国家，两国人口加起来超过２５亿。中印一起走和平发展、合作发展道路，是两国共同利益所在，对亚洲和世界也是一件大好事。, ２０１０年５月，我与到访中国的帕蒂尔总统进行了很好的会晤。当时，我们都表示，要充分发挥两国合作的巨大潜力，推动中印关系向新的更高水平发展。近年来，在双方共同努力下，中印关系得到很大发展，深化了妥善处理分歧、谋求共同发展的友好相处之道。中方视中印关系为最重要的双边关系之一，致力于推动中印战略合作伙伴关系不断向前发展。, 当前，中印两国都在加快发展，这为两国加强互利合作提供了更多机遇。双方要抓住机遇，扎扎实实推进各领域交流合作，把中印关系提高到新水平。一是要保持战略沟通，把握好双边关系发展的大方向。二是要发挥互补优势，在基础设施建设、相互投资等领域拓展互利合作。三是要加强文化纽带，增进两国人民相互了解和友谊。四是要扩大在多边领域的协调和配合，共同维护发展中国家正当权益，共同应对全球性问题。五是要照顾对方核心关切，妥善处理两国间存在的问题和分歧。, 中印边界问题是历史遗留的复杂问题，解决起来并不容易。只要我们坚持友好协商，最终能够找到公平合理和双方都能接受的解决办法。在边界问题最终解决之前，双方要共同维护好边境地区和平安宁，不使边界问题影响两国关系整体发展。, 巴西《经济价值报》记者：您如何评价目前的中巴关系？中方对加强两国经贸合作有何设想，是否将从巴西进口更多高附加值产品？, 习近平：我最近一次访问巴西是在２００９年２月，同卢拉总统举行了很好的会谈。卢拉总统后来访华，我又同他会见。我很关心卢拉总统的身体，祝他身体健康。, 中国和巴西分别是东西半球最大的发展中国家，也同为新兴市场国家。中国历来重视发展同巴西的友好合作。２０年前，巴西成为第一个同中国建立战略伙伴关系的发展中国家。２０年来，中巴关系得到长足发展，给两国和两国人民带来了巨大利益，为各自发展提供了机遇，也为国际秩序和国际体系朝着更加公正合理的方向发展作出了贡献。, 当前，中巴关系正处于历史最好水平，战略性和全局性日益凸显。在即将举行的金砖国家领导人第五次会晤期间，我将同罗塞夫总统举行双边会晤。我期待着届时同罗塞夫总统就推动中巴关系实现更广泛更深入的发展坦诚交换意见。, 经贸合作是中巴关系的物质基础。目前，中国是巴西最大贸易伙伴，巴西是中国第十大贸易伙伴。两国发展利益从未像今天这样紧密相连，双边经贸合作对两国发展经济、改善民生的作用不断增强。中方愿同巴方进一步挖掘两国经济互补潜力，优化贸易结构，扩大合作领域。双方还可以充分发挥各自优势，促进两国产业对接，创新合作模式，提高整体经贸合作水平。, 我相信，在双方共同努力下，两国经贸合作一定能够在规模和水平上不断取得新突破，既促进两国更好实现持续发展，又有利于两国增强适应经济全球化深入发展新形势、抵御国际经济风险的能力。, 印度报业托拉斯记者：您如何看待以金砖国家为代表的新兴市场国家和发展中国家的兴起对现有世界格局及全球治理体系的影响？, 习近平：当前，包括金砖国家在内的一大批新兴市场国家和发展中国家经济快速发展，成为维护世界和平、促进共同发展的重要力量，并在应对国际金融危机、推动全球经济增长方面发挥了重要作用。这顺应了和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流。, 全球经济治理体系必须反映世界经济格局的深刻变化，增加新兴市场国家和发展中国家的代表性和发言权。近年来，二十国集团领导人峰会作用明显，国际货币基金组织和世界银行进行了份额改革，这是朝着全球经济治理体系变革正确方向迈出的重要步伐。新兴市场国家和发展中国家希望全球经济治理体系更完善、更符合世界生产力发展要求、更有利于世界各国共同发展。, 新华社记者：您如何评价当前金砖国家合作水平？对本次金砖国家领导人德班会晤有何期待？, 习近平：金砖国家合作有利于促进世界经济更加平衡、全球经济治理更加完善、国际关系更加民主。, 中方期待会晤深化金砖国家伙伴关系，完善金砖国家合作机制，加强各领域对话和合作，挖掘务实合作潜力，向国际社会传递团结、合作、共赢的积极信息。, 中方支持主席国南非把成立金砖国家开发银行、外汇储备库、工商理事会、智库理事会等列入会晤筹备重点，期待会晤在这些方面取得积极成果。, 德班会晤期间还将举行金砖国家同非洲领导人对话会。中方支持金砖国家同非洲加强对话和交流，构建伙伴关系，维护共同利益，实现共同发展。, 俄通—塔斯社和俄罗斯全国广播电视公司记者：展望未来，中国共产党将在中国发展的历史进程中扮演何种角色？是否会在推进改革方面迈出新步伐？中国特色社会主义是否会有进一步发展？, 习近平：中国共产党在中国执政，就是要带领人民把国家建设得更好，让人民生活得更好。我说过，打铁还需自身硬。要肩负起这个使命，中国共产党就必须加强自身建设，保持自身的先进性和纯洁性，保持同人民群众的血肉联系，不断提高领导水平和执政水平，不断提高拒腐防变和抵御风险能力，不断提高科学执政、民主执政、依法执政水平，更好为人民服务。, 改革开放是当代中国的鲜明标志和活力源泉，是发展中国特色社会主义的必由之路。没有改革开放，就没有中国的今天，也不会有中国更加美好的未来。我多次强调，改革开放只有进行时，没有完成时；改革开放中的矛盾只能用改革开放的办法来解决。在新的历史条件下，我们要开创发展新局面，就必须实现改革新突破。我们将加强改革的顶层设计和总体规划，协调推进经济、政治、文化、社会、生态等各方面体制改革，敢于啃硬骨头，敢于涉险滩，坚决破除一切妨碍科学发展的体制机制弊端，激发全社会创造活力，推动国家各项事业发展。, 我们认为，正如一棵大树上没有完全一样的两片树叶一样，天下没有放之四海而皆准的经验，也没有一成不变的发展模式。中国特色社会主义肯定还要不断发展、不断完善。世界在变化，中国也在变化，中国特色社会主义也必须随着形势和条件的变化而向前发展。只有不断与时俱进，中国才能充满活力。我们愿意借鉴人类一切文明成果，但不会照抄照搬任何国家的发展模式。中国的改革是中国特色社会主义制度的自我完善和发展。只有走中国人民自己选择的道路，走适合中国国情的道路，最终才能走得通、走得好。, 新华社记者：中国经济实力已居世界第二位，这将给中国处理同外部世界的关系带来什么变化？您最近阐述了实现中华民族伟大复兴的“中国梦”，中国的“世界梦”是什么？, 习近平：经过３０多年的改革开放，中国经济社会发展取得巨大成就，人民生活水平显著提高。这既有利于中国，也有利于世界。中国人是讲爱国主义的，同时我们也是具有国际视野和国际胸怀的。随着国力不断增强，中国将在力所能及的范围内承担更多国际责任和义务，为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出更大贡献。, 需要指出的是，尽管中国经济总量已位居世界第二位，但人均国内生产总值同世界平均水平相比还有不小差距，实现富民强国还有很长的路要走。现在，国际上有人担心，中国发展起来后会不会也搞霸权主义、欺负别人。这种担心完全没有必要。中国已经多次向国际社会庄严承诺，中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，永远不称霸，永远不搞扩张。“君子一言，驷马难追。”我们说话是算数的，实践已经证明中国是说到做到的。我们也希望世界各国都走和平发展道路，共同致力于促进世界和平与发展。, 实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，是近代以来中华民族的夙愿。１８４０年鸦片战争以后，中华民族蒙受了百年的外族入侵和内部战争，中国人民遭遇了极大的灾难和痛苦，真正是苦难深重、命运多舛。中国人民发自内心地拥护实现中国梦，因为中国梦首先是１３亿中国人民的共同梦想。, 中国人自古就主张和而不同。我们希望，国与国之间、不同文明之间能够平等交流、相互借鉴、共同进步，各国人民都能够共享世界经济科技发展的成果，各国人民的意愿都能够得到尊重，各国能够齐心协力推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界。, 巴西《经济价值报》记者：您是中国领导人，外界渴望对您本人有更多的了解。比如，您领导一个１３亿人口的大国，感受是什么？每天工作和生活情况怎样？能有多少时间与家人相处？能否介绍一下您个人的经历和爱好？巴西明年将主办世界杯足球赛，您预测哪支球队夺冠？, 习近平：我会见一些国家的领导人时，他们感慨说，中国这么大的国家怎么治理呢？的确，中国有１３亿人口，治理不易，光是把情况了解清楚就不易。我常说，了解中国是要花一番功夫的，只看一两个地方是不够的。中国有９６０万平方公里，５６个民族，１３亿人口，了解中国要切忌“盲人摸象”。, 中国有句古话，“宰相必起于州部，猛将必发于卒伍”。我们现在的干部遴选机制也是一级一级的，比如，我在农村干过，担任过大队党支部书记，在县、市、省、中央都工作过。干部有了丰富的基层经历，就能更好树立群众观点，知道国情，知道人民需要什么，在实践中不断积累各方面经验和专业知识，增强工作能力和才干。这是做好工作的基本条件。, 老百姓的衣食住行，社会的日常运行，国家机器的正常运转，执政党的建设管理，都有大量工作要做。对我来讲，人民把我放在这样的工作岗位上，就要始终把人民放在心中最高的位置，牢记人民重托，牢记责任重于泰山。这样一个大国，这样多的人民，这么复杂的国情，领导者要深入了解国情，了解人民所思所盼，要有“如履薄冰，如临深渊”的自觉，要有“治大国如烹小鲜”的态度，丝毫不敢懈怠，丝毫不敢马虎，必须夙夜在公、勤勉工作。人民是我们力量的源泉。只要与人民同甘共苦，与人民团结奋斗，就没有克服不了的困难，就没有完成不了的任务。, 至于工作量，你们可以想像。担任这样的职务，基本没有自己的时间。工作千头万绪。当然，我会区分轻重缓急。“众人拾柴火焰高。”我们有一个既有分工又有协作的中央领导集体，有一套比较有效的工作机制，大家各负其责，共同把工作做好。, 尽管工作很忙，但“偷得浮生半日闲”，只要有时间，我就同家人在一起。, 我爱好挺多，最大的爱好是读书，读书已成为我的一种生活方式。我也是体育爱好者，喜欢游泳、爬山等运动，年轻时喜欢足球和排球。巴西再度举办世界杯足球赛，我表示祝贺。体育竞赛特别是足球比赛的魅力就在于不可预测。上届世界杯有章鱼保罗，不知道明年还有没有可以预测未来的章鱼？巴西足球队有主场之利，我祝巴西队好运。（新华社北京３月１９日电）,
