A collection of very rough translation of XJP's foreign policy-related speeches at http://jhsjk.people.cn/result?type=108

Please do not use the translations as-is. As some of the speeches are quite long, they have been broken up as segments with overlapping sections. I bear no responsibility for the consequences of your usage of these documents. Please cross-check these translations with someone who actually knows the language. This is really meant for professionals and enthusiasts who are interested in finding out more about China's foreign policy.
