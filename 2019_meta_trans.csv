1,17,"[, Dear President Bossonaro, Dear President Putin, Dear Prime Minister Modi, Dear President Ramaphosa:, Glad to be with you all in Brasilia, First of all I would like to thank Bosona President Luo warmly invited and arranged warmly and thoughtfully. , This is my third visit to Brazil in 10 years. Once again set foot in this vibrant hot spot, Brazil's vast land, rich resources, passionate people, and huge potential impressed me. , This meeting was held at a critical moment in world economic development and the evolution of the international landscape. Looking around the world, new technological revolutions and industrial changes are on the rise, providing more opportunities for countries to achieve leapfrog development. The rising momentum of emerging market countries and developing countries is irreversible, injecting strong momentum into the reform of the global economic governance system. What is worrying is that protectionism and unilateralism are intensifying, governance deficits, development deficits, and trust deficits have continued to increase, and instability and uncertainties in the world economy have increased significantly. In the face of a major change that has not been seen in a century, as important emerging market countries and developing countries, we should follow the trend of the times, respond to the voices of the people, show due responsibilities, be unswerving in our pursuit of development, and work together in solidarity and cooperation. Throughout the process, we have worked hard together to seek happiness for the people and development for the world. , ——Create a peaceful and stable security environment. The world today is not peaceful. The regional security situation continues to be tense, hot issues are emerging, traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined, and global challenges are more prominent. We should advocate the maintenance of world peace and the promotion of common development, the maintenance of fairness and justice, and the promotion of mutual benefit and win-win results. We should advocate and practice multilateralism on the basis of international law and generally accepted basic principles of international relations. We must safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, safeguard the international system with the UN at its core, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and participate constructively in the process of solving geopolitical hotspot issues. Through BRICS foreign ministers’ meetings, meetings of high-level representatives of security affairs, regular counter-terrorism working groups, cyber security working groups, and regular consultations with representatives of multilateral agencies, close strategic communication and collaboration will be given to the common BRICS voice to promote the international order. Development in a more just and reasonable direction. , ——Seek the development prospect of open innovation. Development is the last word. Many problems in today's era are traced to the root cause of the imbalanced development. We should seize the opportunities of the times of reform and innovation, deepen the BRIC’s new industrial revolution partnership, continue to build cooperation results in trade and investment, digital economy, interconnection and other fields, help the economic development of the five countries, and strive to achieve high-quality development. At present, economic globalization has encountered setbacks, which reflects to a certain extent the shortcomings of the global governance system. The BRICS countries should play the role of a responsible big country, actively promote the concept of global governance through consultation, joint construction and sharing, and promote the reform of the global economic governance system. We must resolutely oppose protectionism, maintain the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization as the core, and enhance the voice and influence of emerging market countries and developing countries in international affairs. It is necessary to promote the placing of development issues at the core of the global macro-policy framework, firmly implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement to address climate change, and achieve coordinated development in all areas of the economy, society and environment. , ——Promote humanities exchanges of mutual learning and mutual learning. The history of the development of human society is a history of multi-civilization and symbiosis. Different countries, regions, nations, different histories, religions, and customs intersect each other, and each other draws together to create this wonderful and colorful world. , The BRICS countries provide best practices for world civilization exchanges. In recent years, people-to-people and cultural exchanges have been in full swing in the five countries. Film festivals, sports meets, co-production films and documentaries have gradually spread. People are building a solid bridge among the five countries. We should maintain our momentum, make persistent efforts, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of cultural exchanges. On this basis, we must use the ""BRICS+"" cooperation as a platform to strengthen exchanges and dialogues with different civilizations and different countries, so that the BRICS circle of friends will become larger and larger, and the network of partners will become wider and wider. , Colleagues! , This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. For 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have been self-reliant and struggled hard. They have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice and embarked on the journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. , China will insist on opening wider to the outside world, increase the import of goods and services, expand foreign investment market access, strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights, and form a new pattern of all-round, multi-level and wide-ranging opening up. , China will follow the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, uphold the concept of openness, green and clean, and pursue high quality and benefitA new pattern of comprehensive opening up at multiple levels and in wide areas. , China will follow the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, uphold the concept of openness, green and clean, pursue the goals of high quality, benefit people's livelihood, and sustainability, and work with other countries to promote high-quality joint construction of the “Belt and Road”. China will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, always pursue the path of peaceful development, and develop friendly and cooperative relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

3,19,"[, Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 11th. On October 11th, on the eve of a state visit to Nepal, President Xi Jinping published the article entitled ""Gurkha Daily"", ""Emerging Nepal News"" and ""Kantipur Daily"" in Nepal. Signed article ""Pushing the Friendship Across the Himalayas to New Heights"". The article is as follows: To push the friendship across the Himalayas to a new height, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Bhandari, I will soon pay a state visit to the friendly neighboring Nepal. This is my first visit to Nepal, but Nepal is no stranger to me. The magnificent and beautiful mountains and unique culture here make me yearn for my heart. I have met with Nepalese leaders visiting China many times and have forged a profound friendship with them. I look forward to embarking on this magical land, sharing friendship with Nepalese friends, discussing cooperation and planning a new blueprint for the development of relations between the two countries. , China and Nepal are connected by mountains and rivers and are friendly for generations. More than 1600 years ago, Chinese monk Fa Xian and Nepalese monk Buddha's pilgrimage to each other's country visited each other's country and cooperated in translating Buddhist classics that have been circulating to this day. During the Tang Dynasty in China, Princess Chih-zun of Nepal married Tubo Zampzong Zanbu, and monk Xuan Zang visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Shakyamuni, and left precious written records. In the Yuan Dynasty, the famous Nepalese craftsman Aniko led a craftsman to China and presided over the construction of magnificent buildings such as the white pagoda in Miaoying Temple in Beijing. These friendly stories have inspired the people of the two countries to know each other from generation to generation and move forward together. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal in 1955, the two countries have always respected each other, trusted each other, and supported each other, which has become a model of equitable treatment, friendly cooperation, and mutual benefit among neighboring countries. , ——China and Nepal are good friends of mutual respect and trust. The two sides successfully demarcated the border between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, making the majestic Himalayas a strong link between the two countries. The two sides firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests. Nepal firmly adheres to the one-China policy and does not allow any forces to use Nepali territory for anti-China activities. China firmly supports Nepal’s maintenance of national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and it supports Nepal’s exploration of a development path that suits its national conditions. -China and Nepal are good partners for mutual benefit. Nepal is China's important trading partner and development partner in South Asia. Last year, bilateral trade reached 1.1 billion US dollars, and China's investment in Nepal exceeded 300 million US dollars. The Nigerian side is actively participating in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”. The two sides are building and upgrading infrastructure including roads, ports, airports, power stations, etc. A linking network across the Himalayas is taking shape, which will not only facilitate the two countries but also benefit area. -China and Nepal are good neighbors who learn from each other. The Chinese temple built by China in Lumbini has become a symbol of religious cultural exchange between China and Nepal. Nepal is the first outbound tourist destination country for Chinese citizens in South Asia. Currently, there are about 60 flights between the two countries every week, with more than 300,000 people visiting each year. The two countries have concluded 11 pairs of sister cities. Increasingly frequent exchanges have promoted mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries and provided assistance for their respective development and progress. , ——China and Nepal are good brothers who help each other. In 2008, Wenchuan, China was hit by a devastating earthquake. The Nepalese government and people actively donated money and materials to support China's earthquake relief efforts. After the devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015, the Chinese government and people quickly reached out to implement large-scale rescue operations and supported the reconstruction of Nepal after the disaster. This vividly shows the brotherhood of China and Nepal helping each other. At present, the Nepalese government and people are moving towards the beautiful vision of ""prospering Nepal and happy Nepalese."" The Chinese government and people are also striding forward toward the goal of ""two hundred years"". The people of China and Nepal share the same dream and the destiny is connected. The times require the two countries to strengthen cooperation and create a better future together. , ——We want to deepen strategic communication. Both sides should draw a blueprint for Sino-Nepalese relations in the new era from a strategic and long-term perspective, and push relations between the two countries to reach new heights. We must maintain high-level exchanges, increase political mutual trust, and continue to support each other firmly on issues involving each other's core interests. It is necessary to strengthen the exchange and sharing of experience in governance and development of the country, so as to better benefit the two peoples. , ——We want to expand pragmatic cooperation. Both sides should actively promote the construction of a three-dimensional interconnection network across the Himalayas. China supports Chinese enterprises to invest in Nepal, focusing on strengthening cooperation in the four areas of trade and investment, post-disaster reconstruction, energy and tourism. Nepal is welcome to attend the 2nd China International Import Expo to promote the export of Nepal's characteristic superior products to China. China will continue to strongly support Nepal’s post-disaster reconstruction and provide support and assistance within its ability to improve Nepal’s livelihood. , ——We want to expand cultural exchanges. Both sides should promote exchanges in education, youth, tourism and other fieldsPoor's people's livelihood improvement provides support and assistance within its ability. , ——We want to expand cultural exchanges. Both sides should promote exchanges and cooperation in education, youth, tourism and other fields, support aviation companies of the two countries to open more direct flights, and increase the scale of personnel exchanges. China supports Nepal’s hosting of the ""2020 Nepal Tourism Year"" and encourages more Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal. China will provide more government scholarships to outstanding Nepalese youths and train more talents needed by the Nigerian construction. Welcome more young Nepalese students to study in China. , ——We want to strengthen security cooperation. China supports the Nigerian side in strengthening law enforcement capacity building and will cooperate with the Nigerian side in law enforcement training. Both sides should strengthen border defense contacts, more effectively combat cross-border crimes, and ensure the smooth development of personnel security and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries. We must also continue to strengthen pragmatic cooperation in the areas of mutual visits, personnel training, and equipment technology between the two armed forces. The Nepalese people often say, ""Drips can also fill a tank"", and the Chinese also say, ""Everyone collects firewood and the flames are high."" I believe that as long as the two countries inherit and carry forward their friendly traditions and continue to expand exchanges and cooperation, they will surely advance the friendship between China and Nepal across the Himalayas to a new height. , ""People's Daily"" (October 12, 2019 version 01),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in Nepalese media,1847,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2019-10-12,"[, 新华社北京10月11日电  10月11日，在对尼泊尔进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在尼泊尔《廓尔喀日报》、《新兴尼泊尔报》和《坎蒂普尔日报》发表题为《将跨越喜马拉雅的友谊推向新高度》的署名文章。文章如下：, 将跨越喜马拉雅的友谊推向新高度, 中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 应班达里总统邀请，我即将对友好邻邦尼泊尔进行国事访问。这是我第一次访问尼泊尔，但尼泊尔对我来说并不陌生。这里壮美秀丽的山川、独具特色的文化，令我心向往之。我多次会见访华的尼泊尔领导人，同他们结下了深厚友谊。我期待着踏上这片神奇的土地，同尼泊尔朋友畅叙友情，共话合作，规划两国关系发展新蓝图。, 中尼山水相连，世代友好。1600多年前，中国高僧法显、尼泊尔高僧佛驮跋陀罗互访对方国家，合作翻译了流传至今的佛教经典。中国唐代时，尼泊尔尺尊公主同吐蕃赞普松赞干布联姻，高僧玄奘到访释迦牟尼诞生地兰毗尼并留下珍贵文字记录。元代时，尼泊尔著名工艺家阿尼哥率工匠来华，主持修建了北京妙应寺白塔等宏伟建筑。这些友好佳话，激励着两国人民世世代代相知相亲、携手前行。, 1955年中尼建立外交关系以来，两国始终相互尊重、相互信任、相互支持，成为邻国间平等相待、友好合作、互利共赢的典范。, ——中尼是互尊互信的好朋友。双方在和平共处五项原则基础上顺利划定了两国边界，使巍峨的喜马拉雅山成为连结两国的牢固纽带。双方在涉及彼此核心利益问题上相互坚定支持。尼方坚定奉行一个中国政策，不允许任何势力利用尼泊尔领土从事反华活动。中方坚定支持尼泊尔维护国家主权、独立、领土完整，支持尼方探索符合本国国情的发展道路。, ——中尼是互惠互利的好伙伴。尼泊尔是中国在南亚地区的重要贸易伙伴和发展合作伙伴，去年双边贸易额达到11亿美元，中国对尼泊尔投资超过3亿美元。尼方积极参加共建“一带一路”，双方正在建设和升级包括公路、口岸、机场、电站等在内的基础设施，一个跨越喜马拉雅的联通网络初现雏形，这不仅便利两国，也将造福地区。, ——中尼是互学互鉴的好邻居。中国在兰毗尼建设的中华寺，成为中尼宗教文化交流的标志。尼泊尔是南亚首个中国公民出境旅游目的地国，目前每周有约60个航班往来两国之间，每年人员互访达30多万人次。两国已缔结11对友好城市。日益频繁的交往促进了两国人民相互了解，为两国各自发展进步提供了助力。, ——中尼是互帮互助的好兄弟。2008年中国汶川遭受特大地震灾害，尼泊尔政府和人民踊跃捐款捐物，支持中国抗震救灾。2015年尼泊尔大地震发生后，中国政府和人民迅速伸出援手，实施大规模救援行动，并支持尼泊尔灾后重建。这生动展现了中尼守望相助的兄弟之情。, 当前，尼泊尔政府和人民正向着“繁荣尼泊尔、幸福尼泊尔人”的美好愿景砥砺前行，中国政府和人民也在朝着“两个一百年”奋斗目标阔步前进。中尼两国人民梦想相通，命运相连。时代要求两国加强合作，共创美好未来。, ——我们要深化战略沟通。双方要从战略高度和长远角度擘画新时期中尼关系蓝图，推动两国关系再攀新高。要保持高层交往，增进政治互信，在涉及彼此核心利益问题上继续坚定相互支持。要加强治国理政和发展经验交流分享，更好造福两国人民。, ——我们要拓展务实合作。双方要积极推进跨喜马拉雅立体互联互通网络建设。中方支持中资企业赴尼泊尔投资兴业，重点加强贸易投资、灾后重建、能源、旅游四大领域合作。欢迎尼方出席第二届中国国际进口博览会，促进尼泊尔特色优势产品对华出口。中方将继续大力支持尼泊尔灾后重建，为尼泊尔民生改善提供力所能及的支持和帮助。, ——我们要扩大人文交流。双方要促进教育、青年、旅游等领域交流合作，支持两国航空企业开通更多直航，增加人员往来规模。中方支持尼方主办“2020尼泊尔旅游年”活动，鼓励更多中国公民赴尼泊尔旅游观光。中方将为尼泊尔优秀青年提供更多政府奖学金，培养更多尼方建设需要的人才。欢迎更多尼泊尔青年学生来华留学深造。, ——我们要加强安全合作。中方支持尼方加强执法能力建设，将同尼方开展执法培训合作。双方要加强边防联系，更有效打击跨境犯罪，确保两国人员安全和经贸往来顺利开展。还要继续加强两军互访、人员培训、装备技术等领域务实合作。, 尼泊尔人民常说，“滴水也能装满缸”，中国人也讲“众人拾柴火焰高”。我相信，只要两国继承和发扬友好传统，持之以恒扩大交流合作，就一定能把中尼跨越喜马拉雅的友谊推向新高度。, 《 人民日报 》（ 2019年10月12日 01 版）, ]",习近平在尼泊尔媒体发表署名文章,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/31395239
4,20,"[, Ladies and Gentlemen, Reporter friends: Hello everyone! , Welcome everyone to participate in the press conference of the Second Belt and Road International Cooperation Summit Forum. Over the past five years since the proposal to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative, it has been widely concerned by media friends. Since the opening of this summit forum, journalist friends have continued to pay attention to and report on the summit forum, recording various wonderful moments, disseminating various good voices, and showing the fruitful results of the cooperation in building the “Belt and Road”. On behalf of the Chinese government and delegates from various countries, I would like to express my gratitude to the journalist friends for their support and hard work! This is the second time China has hosted the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum. Compared with the first forum, this forum is larger in scale, richer in content, more participating countries, and more fruitful. During the summit forum, we held an opening ceremony, convened a high-level meeting, held 12 sub-forums and an entrepreneur conference, and representatives from all walks of life from more than 150 countries participated. Today, leaders from 38 countries and heads of the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund held a roundtable summit of leaders here. The theme of this summit forum is ""Building the Belt and Road Together and Creating a Better Future"". At the round table summit, the leaders and heads of international organizations centered on ""promoting interconnection, exploring new growth drivers"", ""strengthening policy linkages and building closer partnerships"", ""promoting green and sustainable development and implementing the UN 2030 Agenda"" In-depth discussions on topics such as this have improved the concept of cooperation, clarified the focus of cooperation, strengthened the cooperation mechanism, and reached broad consensus on high-quality joint construction of the “Belt and Road”. These consensuses are reflected in the joint communiqué unanimously adopted by the Round Table Summit, and will serve as a guide for future cooperation in building the “Belt and Road” international cooperation. ——We positively evaluate the progress and significance of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” cooperation. We all believe that jointly building the “Belt and Road” is the road to opportunities for common prosperity. Over the past five years of jointly building the “Belt and Road”, especially since the first summit forum, with the joint efforts of all parties, the scope of policy communication has been continuously expanded, the level of facility connectivity has been improved, and economic and trade and investment cooperation have reached a new level, and the ability of capital and financial communication has continued. Increased, people-to-people exchanges are closer. The early gains from the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” cooperation have opened up more space for economic growth in countries and the world, created a platform for strengthening international cooperation, and made new contributions to building a community of shared future for mankind. , ——We have enriched the cooperative concept of “Belt and Road” and unanimously reaffirmed our commitment to high-quality joint construction of “Belt and Road”. We will adhere to the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, with equal consultation, shared responsibility, and common benefit from all parties. All interested countries are welcome to participate.

We agree to practice high standards, benefit people's livelihood, and sustainable concepts, actively connect with generally accepted international rules and standards, adhere to the people-centered development concept, and take the road of coordinated development of economy, society, and environment. These consensuses point out the direction for the development of ""One Belt, One Road"" cooperation. Our common goal is to work together to make countries more interconnected and more effective, with stronger economic growth, closer international cooperation, and better people's lives. ——We have made clear the focus of future cooperation on “Belt and Road” and decided to strengthen all-round and multi-field cooperation. We will continue to promote land, sea, air, and Internet interconnection and build high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, affordable, and inclusive infrastructure. We will promote the construction of economic corridors, the development of economic and trade industrial cooperation parks, continue to strengthen market, regulations, standards and other aspects of soft connectivity, as well as the construction of digital infrastructure. Relevant cooperation projects will adhere to government guidance, business entities, and market operations to ensure sustainability and create a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for investors from all countries. We will continue to expand financing channels and reduce financing costs, and welcome multilateral and international financial institutions to participate in investment and financing cooperation. We also agreed to extensively carry out rich and diverse humanities exchanges and implement more people's livelihood cooperation projects. We all support the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” cooperation, adhere to the development orientation, support the global development cause, especially the implementation of the United Nations 2030 sustainable development agenda, and strive to achieve clean, low-carbon and sustainable development, while helping developing countries break the development bottleneck and better integrate Global value chain, industrial chain, supply chain and benefit from it. -We unanimously support efforts to build a global interconnection partnership and strengthen cooperation mechanisms. To this end, we will deeply connect the economic development initiatives and plans of countries and international organizations, strengthen bilateral and third-party market cooperation, and buildTo strengthen cooperation mechanisms. To this end, we will deeply connect with the economic development initiatives and plans of various countries and international organizations, strengthen bilateral and third-party market cooperation, build major international logistics and trade channels such as China-Europe trains, new land and sea channels, and help more countries improve their connectivity. We have read the policy recommendation report of the Summit Forum Advisory Committee, and look forward to the Advisory Committee providing more intellectual support for the cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road” and the development of the Summit Forum. We will adhere to multilateralism and promote the formation of a framework led by the Summit Forum and supported by multilateral and bilateral cooperation in various fields, so that our cooperation can be guided by ideas, follow up actions, and be guaranteed by mechanisms. It is generally believed that the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum is an important multilateral cooperation platform and supports the normalization of the Summit Forum. -We all support strengthening pragmatic cooperation and achieving more tangible results. During and during the preparatory process of this forum, the parties reached 283 pragmatic results, including signing intergovernmental cooperation agreements, carrying out pragmatic project cooperation, initiating the establishment of a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform in the professional field, and publishing the progress report on the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” , The policy recommendation report of the Advisory Committee of the Summit Forum, etc. As the presidency, China will release a list of achievements. Entrepreneur conference held during the forum attracted many business people and signed a project cooperation agreement worth more than 64 billion US dollars. These achievements have fully demonstrated that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” should meet the trend, win the people's hearts, benefit the people's livelihood, and benefit the world. , Yesterday, I announced a series of major reform and opening-up measures that China will take. It is generally believed that this is good news for China and the world and will provide important opportunities for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” and the development of the world economy. , This forum has sent a clear signal to the outside world: the building of the “Belt and Road” circle of friends is getting bigger and bigger, there are more and more good partners, the quality of cooperation is higher and higher, and the development prospects are getting better and better. I have said many times that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative originated in China, and the opportunities and achievements belong to the world. The joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is a long-term project and a common cause for partners. China is willing to work with all parties to implement the consensus of this summit forum, draw the spirit of ""meticulous painting"", and jointly promote the cooperation in building the ""Belt and Road"" cooperation to achieve deeper, more stable, far-reaching, high-quality development, and create more glorious future. I hope that journalists and friends from the media will continue to actively support the cooperation in building the “Belt and Road”. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th), ""People's Daily"" (April 28, 2019, 02 edition),]","Xi Jinping's speech at the press conference of the 2nd ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum",2271,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2019-04-28,"[, 女士们，先生们，, 记者朋友们：, 大家好！, 欢迎大家参加第二届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛记者会。共建“一带一路”倡议提出5年多来，一直受到媒体朋友们广泛关注。本届高峰论坛开幕以来，记者朋友们持续关注和报道高峰论坛，记录下各个精彩瞬间，传播了各种好声音，展现了共建“一带一路”合作的丰硕成果。我谨代表中国政府和各国与会代表，对记者朋友们的支持和辛勤工作表示感谢！, 这是中国第二次举办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛。同首届论坛相比，本届论坛规模更大、内容更丰富、参与国家更多、成果更丰硕。高峰论坛期间，我们举行了开幕式，召开了高级别会议，举办了12场分论坛和一场企业家大会，来自150多个国家的各界代表参加。今天，来自38个国家的领导人和联合国、国际货币基金组织负责人在这里举行了领导人圆桌峰会。, 这次高峰论坛的主题是“共建‘一带一路’、开创美好未来”。圆桌峰会上，与会领导人和国际组织负责人围绕“推进互联互通，挖掘增长新动力”、“加强政策对接，打造更紧密伙伴关系”、“推动绿色和可持续发展，落实联合国2030年议程”等议题进行深入讨论，完善了合作理念，明确了合作重点，强化了合作机制，就高质量共建“一带一路”达成了广泛共识。这些共识反映在圆桌峰会一致通过的联合公报中，将成为今后共建“一带一路”国际合作的行动指南。, ——我们积极评价共建“一带一路”合作取得的进展和意义。我们都认为，共建“一带一路”是通向共同繁荣的机遇之路。共建“一带一路”5年多来，特别是首届高峰论坛以来，在各方共同努力下，政策沟通范围不断拓展，设施联通水平日益提升，经贸和投资合作又上新台阶，资金融通能力持续增强，人文交流往来更加密切。共建“一带一路”合作取得的早期收获，为各国和世界经济增长开辟了更多空间，为加强国际合作打造了平台，为构建人类命运共同体作出了新贡献。, ——我们丰富了共建“一带一路”合作理念，一致重申致力于高质量共建“一带一路”。我们将坚持共商共建共享原则，由各方平等协商、责任共担、共同受益，欢迎所有感兴趣的国家都参与进来。我们一致支持开放、廉洁、绿色发展，反对保护主义，努力建设风清气正、环境友好的新时代丝绸之路。我们同意践行高标准、惠民生、可持续理念，积极对接普遍接受的国际规则标准，坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，走经济、社会、环境协调发展之路。这些共识为共建“一带一路”合作的发展指明了方向，我们的共同目标是，携手努力让各国互联互通更加有效，经济增长更加强劲，国际合作更加密切，人民生活更加美好。, ——我们明确了未来共建“一带一路”合作的重点，决定加强全方位、多领域合作。我们将继续推进陆上、海上、空中、网上互联互通，建设高质量、可持续、抗风险、价格合理、包容可及的基础设施。我们将推进建设经济走廊，发展经贸产业合作园区，继续加强市场、规制、标准等方面软联通，以及数字基础设施建设。有关合作项目将坚持政府引导、企业主体、市场运作，确保可持续性，并为各国投资者营造公平和非歧视的营商环境。我们将继续拓宽融资渠道，降低融资成本，欢迎多边和各国金融机构参与投融资合作。我们还同意广泛开展内容丰富、形式多样的人文交流，实施更多民生合作项目。我们都支持共建“一带一路”合作坚持发展导向，支持全球发展事业特别是落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程，努力实现清洁低碳可持续发展，同时帮助发展中国家打破发展瓶颈，更好融入全球价值链、产业链、供应链并从中受益。, ——我们一致支持着力构建全球互联互通伙伴关系，加强合作机制。为此，我们将深入对接各国和国际组织经济发展倡议和规划，加强双边和第三方市场合作，建设中欧班列、陆海新通道等国际物流和贸易大通道，帮助更多国家提升互联互通水平。我们参阅了高峰论坛咨询委员会政策建议报告，期待咨询委员会为共建“一带一路”合作和高峰论坛发展提供更多智力支持。我们将坚持多边主义，推动形成以高峰论坛为引领、各领域多双边合作为支撑的架构，使我们的合作既有理念引领、行动跟进，也有机制保障。大家普遍认为，“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛是重要多边合作平台，支持高峰论坛常态化举办。, ——我们都支持加强务实合作，取得更多实实在在的成果。在这次论坛筹备进程中和举办期间，各方达成了283项务实成果，包括签署政府间合作协议，开展务实项目合作，发起成立专业领域多边对话合作平台，发布共建“一带一路”进展报告、高峰论坛咨询委员会政策建议报告等。中方作为主席国，将汇总发布一份成果清单。论坛期间举行的企业家大会吸引了众多工商界人士参与，签署了总额640多亿美元的项目合作协议。这些成果充分说明，共建“一带一路”应潮流、得民心、惠民生、利天下。, 昨天，我宣布了中国将采取的一系列重大改革开放措施。大家普遍认为，这对中国和世界都是好消息，将为共建“一带一路”和世界经济发展提供重要机遇。, 这届论坛对外传递了一个明确信号：共建“一带一路”的朋友圈越来越大，好伙伴越来越多，合作质量越来越高，发展前景越来越好。我多次说过，共建“一带一路”倡议源于中国，机会和成果属于世界。共建“一带一路”是一项长期工程，是合作伙伴们共同的事业。中国愿同各方一道，落实好本届高峰论坛各项共识，以绘制“工笔画”的精神，共同推动共建“一带一路”合作走深走实、行稳致远、高质量发展，开创更加美好的未来。希望媒体记者朋友们继续积极支持共建“一带一路”合作。, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京4月27日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2019年04月28日 02 版）, ]",习近平在第二届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛记者会上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/31053842
5,21,"[, Dear President Macron, Dear Prime Minister Merkel, Dear Chairman Juncker, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Paris, March, Spring and Jingming, full of vitality. I am very pleased to be invited to the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Forum on my visit to France. Yesterday, the delegates conducted a constructive dialogue and discussion around the forum topics, and achieved positive results in many aspects. First of all, I would like to express my sincere greetings to all delegates! Congratulations on the success of the forum! , Yesterday, during my meeting with President Macron, I also exchanged in-depth views on global governance and reached an important consensus. Both China and France are important participants in global governance and have a broad political consensus and a solid foundation for cooperation on major issues such as maintaining world peace, security and stability, maintaining multilateralism and free trade, and supporting the active role of the United Nations. China and France adhere to mutual respect, mutual trust, equality, openness and tolerance, mutual benefit and win-win results, jointly uphold the basic principles of international relations, and jointly promote the improvement of global governance, which has become an important force for maintaining world peace and stability and promoting the progress of human civilization. Just now I held a four-party meeting with President Macron, Prime Minister Merkel, and President Juncker, and discussed in depth on multilateralism and the development of China-EU strategic partnership and reached further consensus. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Two years ago, when I gave a speech at the UN headquarters in Geneva, I asked, ""What's wrong with the world, what do we do?"" The world today is facing a major change that has not been seen in a century. Peace and development remain the themes of the times. At the same time, instability and uncertainty are more prominent, and mankind is facing many common challenges. , France has a proverb that says: ""The destiny of man is in his own hands."" Faced with the severe global challenges and the choice of human development at the crossroads, countries should have the responsibility to take the world as their own responsibility and be active Be an activist, not a wait-and-see, and work together to control the future and destiny of humanity in your own hands. , First, insist on fairness and reasonableness, and crack the governance deficit. Global hotspot issues are emerging one after another, and non-traditional security threats such as climate change, cyber security, and refugee crises continue to spread. Protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise. The global governance system and multilateral mechanisms have been hit. We must adhere to the global governance concept of joint consultation, joint construction and sharing, insist that global affairs be handled by the people of all countries, and actively promote the democratization of global governance rules. We must continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism of the United Nations, give full play to the constructive role of global and regional multilateral mechanisms such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the G20, and the European Union, and jointly promote the building of a community of shared future for mankind. Second, insist on mutual consultation and mutual understanding, and break the trust deficit. Trust is the best binder in international relations. At present, the international competition friction is on the rise, the color of geo-gaming is obviously increasing, and the trust and cooperation of the international community have been eroded. We must put mutual respect and mutual trust at the forefront, take advantage of dialogue and consultation, persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and assimilate differences, and through frank and in-depth dialogue and communication, enhance strategic mutual trust and reduce mutual suspicion. We must adhere to the correct view of righteousness and benefit, prioritize righteousness and give consideration to righteousness and benefit, and build a global partnership of shared destiny. It is necessary to strengthen exchanges and dialogues among different civilizations, deepen mutual understanding and mutual recognition, and let people of all countries know each other, trust each other and trust each other. Current cooperation in China-EU relations is the mainstream, and even if there is competition, it should be benign competition. We must trust each other and move forward together. Third, insist on working together to solve the peace deficit. The security environment that mankind is in today is still worrying. Regional conflicts and local wars continue. Terrorism is still rampant. People in many countries, especially children, have been devastated by war. We must uphold the new security concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, abandon the old thinking of Cold War thinking, zero-sum game, abandon the jungle law of weak meat and strong food, seek peace through cooperation, promote security through cooperation, and insist on peaceful settlement of disputes. We oppose the use of force or threat of force at all times. We oppose provoking incidents and intensifying contradictions for our own selfishness. We oppose neighboring beggars and harming others. We all take the path of peaceful development and achieve long-term world peace. Fourth, insist on mutual benefit and win-win results, and break the development deficit. Economic globalization is the engine that drives world economic growth. At present, the trend of anti-globalization is fermenting, the negative effects of protectionism are becoming increasingly apparent, and the inequality of income distribution and the imbalance of development space have become the most prominent problems facing global economic governance. We must persist in innovation-driven development to create a dynamic growth model; adhere to coordinated linkages to create an open and win-win cooperation model; adhere to fair and inclusive, create a balanced and inclusive development model, so that people around the world can share the achievements of economic globalization. China supports the necessaryTolerate, create a balanced and inclusive development model, and allow people around the world to share the achievements of economic globalization. China supports the necessary reforms to the World Trade Organization, better builds an open world economy, maintains the multilateral trading system, and guides economic globalization to develop more healthily. The “Belt and Road” initiative enriches the concept of international economic cooperation and the connotation of multilateralism, and provides an important way to promote world economic growth and achieve common development. We welcome all countries in the world, including France, to actively participate in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The friendship between China and France has a long history. This year is the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. The two countries have carried out many strategic cooperations, and there is still much room for cooperation. As a French friend said, without climbing the Eiffel Tower, one cannot see the most beautiful scenery in Paris. Under the new situation, we should ascend our horizons, face the future, and strengthen cooperation. We must deepen cooperation in traditional fields such as nuclear energy, aerospace, agricultural food, health care, and automobile manufacturing, accelerate cooperation in emerging fields such as green manufacturing, digital economy, artificial intelligence, financial services, and urban sustainable development, and strengthen cooperation on climate change. Implement the ""Paris Agreement"" and promote this year's United Nations Climate Summit to achieve positive results for the well-being of the two peoples and peoples. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends!

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Juncker were invited to attend. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ju Pengshe, President Xi Jinping attended the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Forum in Paris on the 26th and delivered an important speech entitled ""Contributing Wisdom and Strength to a Better Earth Home"". The full text is as follows:, contribute wisdom and strength to build a better earth home, ——Speech at the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Forum, (Paris, March 26, 2019), President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, Dear Mark President Long, Dear Prime Minister Merkel, Dear President Juncker, Ladies, Gentlemen and Friends: Paris, March, Spring and Jingming, full of vitality. I am very pleased to be invited to the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Forum on my visit to France. Yesterday, the delegates conducted a constructive dialogue and discussion around the forum topics, and achieved positive results in many aspects. First of all, I would like to express my sincere greetings to all delegates! Congratulations on the success of the forum! , Yesterday, during my meeting with President Macron, I also exchanged in-depth views on global governance and reached an important consensus. Both China and France are important participants in global governance and have a broad political consensus and a solid foundation for cooperation on major issues such as maintaining world peace, security and stability, maintaining multilateralism and free trade, and supporting the active role of the United Nations. China and France adhere to mutual respect, mutual trust, equality, openness and tolerance, mutual benefit and win-win results, jointly uphold the basic principles of international relations, and jointly promote the improvement of global governance, which has become an important force for maintaining world peace and stability and promoting the progress of human civilization. Just now I held a four-party meeting with President Macron, Prime Minister Merkel, and President Juncker, and discussed in depth on multilateralism and the development of China-EU strategic partnership and reached further consensus. On March 26, President Xi Jinping attended the closing ceremony of the China-France Global Governance Forum in Paris and delivered a speech. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ju Pengshe, ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Two years ago, when I gave a speech at the UN headquarters in Geneva, I asked, ""What's wrong with the world, what do we do?"" The world today is facing a major change that has not been seen in a century. Peace and development remain the themes of the times. At the same time, instability and uncertainty are more prominent, and mankind is facing many common challenges. , France has a proverb that says: ""The destiny of man is in his own hands."" Faced with the severe global challenges and the choice of human development at the crossroads, countries should have the responsibility to take the world as their own responsibility and be active Be an activist, not a wait-and-see, and work together to control the future and destiny of humanity in your own hands. , First, insist on fairness and reasonableness, and crack the governance deficit. Global hotspot issues are emerging one after another, and non-traditional security threats such as climate change, cyber security, and refugee crises continue to spread. Protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise. The global governance system and multilateral mechanisms have been hit. We must adhere to the global governance concept of joint consultation, joint construction and sharing, insist that global affairs be handled by the people of all countries, and actively promote the democratization of global governance rules. We must continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism of the United Nations, give full play to the constructive role of global and regional multilateral mechanisms such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the G20, and the European Union, and jointly promote the building of a community of shared future for mankind. Second, insist on mutual consultation and mutual understanding, and break the trust deficit. Trust is the best binder in international relations. At present, the international competition friction is on the rise, the color of geo-gaming is obviously increasing, and the trust and cooperation of the international community have been eroded. We must put mutual respect and mutual trust at the forefront, take advantage of dialogue and consultation, persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and assimilate differences, and through frank and in-depth dialogue and communication, enhance strategic mutual trust and reduce mutual suspicion. We must adhere to the correct view of righteousness and benefit, prioritize righteousness and give consideration to righteousness and benefit, and build a global partnership of shared destiny. It is necessary to strengthen exchanges and dialogues among different civilizations, deepen mutual understanding and mutual recognition, and let people of all countries know each other, trust each other and trust each other. Current cooperation in China-EU relations is the mainstream, and even if there is competition, it should be benign competition. We must trust each other and move forward together. Third, insist on working together to solve the peace deficit. The security environment that mankind is in today is still worrying. Regional conflicts and local wars continue. Terrorism is still rampant. People in many countries, especially children, have been devastated by war. We must uphold the new security concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, abandon the old thinking of the Cold War mentality, zero-sum game, abandon the jungle law of weak meat and strong food, seek peace through cooperation, promote security through cooperation, and insist on peaceful methods, Abandon the old thinking of the Cold War mentality, zero-sum game, abandon the jungle law of weak meat and strong food, seek peace through cooperation, promote security through cooperation, insist on peaceful settlement of disputes, oppose the use of force or threat of force at all, and oppose one’s own private Provoking incidents, intensifying contradictions, opposing neighbors as beneficiaries, harming others and self-interest, all countries take the path of peaceful development and achieve long-term peace in the world. Fourth, insist on mutual benefit and win-win results, and break the development deficit. Economic globalization is the engine that drives world economic growth. At present, the trend of anti-globalization is fermenting, the negative effects of protectionism are becoming increasingly apparent, and the inequality of income distribution and the imbalance of development space have become the most prominent problems facing global economic governance. We must persist in innovation-driven development to create a dynamic growth model; adhere to coordinated linkages to create an open and win-win cooperation model; adhere to fair and inclusive, create a balanced and inclusive development model, so that people around the world can share the achievements of economic globalization. China supports the necessary reforms to the World Trade Organization, better builds an open world economy, maintains the multilateral trading system, and guides economic globalization to develop more healthily. The “Belt and Road” initiative enriches the concept of international economic cooperation and the connotation of multilateralism, and provides an important way to promote world economic growth and achieve common development. We welcome all countries in the world, including France, to actively participate in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The friendship between China and France has a long history. This year is the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. The two countries have carried out many strategic cooperations, and there is still much room for cooperation. As a French friend said, without climbing the Eiffel Tower, one cannot see the most beautiful scenery in Paris. Under the new situation, we should ascend our horizons, face the future, and strengthen cooperation. We must deepen cooperation in traditional fields such as nuclear energy, aerospace, agricultural food, health care, and automobile manufacturing, accelerate cooperation in emerging fields such as green manufacturing, digital economy, artificial intelligence, financial services, and urban sustainable development, and strengthen cooperation on climate change. Implement the ""Paris Agreement"" and promote this year's United Nations Climate Summit to achieve positive results for the well-being of the two peoples and peoples. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Historical development, prosperous civilization, and human progress can never be separated from ideological guidance. The Sino-French Global Governance Forum will provide strong intellectual support for the two countries to participate in and promote global governance. I hope that both China and France and relevant parties will keep the dialogue channels open, promote cooperation through exchanges and promote win-win through cooperation, and join hands to contribute wisdom and strength to a better earth home! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 26th),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the closing ceremony of the Sino-French Global Governance Forum,2280,来源：新华网          发布时间：2019-03-27,"[, , 3月26日，国家主席习近平在巴黎同法国总统马克龙一道出席中法全球治理论坛闭幕式。德国总理默克尔、欧盟委员会主席容克应邀出席。 新华社记者 鞠鹏 摄, 国家主席习近平26日在巴黎出席中法全球治理论坛闭幕式，并发表题为《为建设更加美好的地球家园贡献智慧和力量》的重要讲话。全文如下：, 为建设更加美好的地球家园贡献智慧和力量, ——在中法全球治理论坛闭幕式上的讲话, （2019年3月26日，巴黎）, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 尊敬的马克龙总统，, 尊敬的默克尔总理，, 尊敬的容克主席，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 3月的巴黎，春和景明，生机盎然。很高兴在我访问法国之际受邀出席中法全球治理论坛闭幕式。昨天，与会代表围绕论坛议题，开展了富有建设性的对话研讨，取得了多方面积极成果。首先，我谨向各位参会代表表示诚挚的问候！对论坛取得成功表示衷心的祝贺！, 昨天，我同马克龙总统会晤时也围绕全球治理深入交换了意见，达成重要共识。中法同为全球治理的重要参与者，在维护世界和平安全稳定、维护多边主义和自由贸易、支持联合国发挥积极作用等重大问题上有着广泛政治共识和坚实合作基础。中法两国坚持互尊互信、平等相待、开放包容、互利共赢，共同维护国际关系基本准则，共同推进全球治理完善，成为维护世界和平稳定、促进人类文明进步的重要力量。刚刚我同马克龙总统、默克尔总理、容克主席举行了四方会晤，围绕多边主义、中欧战略伙伴关系发展深入探讨，达成了进一步共识。, , 3月26日，国家主席习近平在巴黎出席中法全球治理论坛闭幕式并致辞。 新华社记者 鞠鹏 摄, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 两年前，我在联合国日内瓦总部演讲时，发出“世界怎么了、我们怎么办”之问。当今世界正面临百年未有之大变局，和平与发展仍然是时代主题，同时不稳定性不确定性更加突出，人类面临许多共同挑战。, 法国有句谚语说：“人的命运掌握在自己的手里。”面对严峻的全球性挑战，面对人类发展在十字路口何去何从的抉择，各国应该有以天下为己任的担当精神，积极做行动派、不做观望者，共同努力把人类前途命运掌握在自己手中。, 第一，坚持公正合理，破解治理赤字。全球热点问题此起彼伏、持续不断，气候变化、网络安全、难民危机等非传统安全威胁持续蔓延，保护主义、单边主义抬头，全球治理体系和多边机制受到冲击。我们要坚持共商共建共享的全球治理观，坚持全球事务由各国人民商量着办，积极推进全球治理规则民主化。我们要继续高举联合国这面多边主义旗帜，充分发挥世界贸易组织、国际货币基金组织、世界银行、二十国集团、欧盟等全球和区域多边机制的建设性作用，共同推动构建人类命运共同体。, 第二，坚持互商互谅，破解信任赤字。信任是国际关系中最好的黏合剂。当前，国际竞争摩擦呈上升之势，地缘博弈色彩明显加重，国际社会信任和合作受到侵蚀。我们要把互尊互信挺在前头，把对话协商利用起来，坚持求同存异、聚同化异，通过坦诚深入的对话沟通，增进战略互信，减少相互猜疑。要坚持正确义利观，以义为先、义利兼顾，构建命运与共的全球伙伴关系。要加强不同文明交流对话，加深相互理解和彼此认同，让各国人民相知相亲、互信互敬。当前中欧关系中合作是主流，即使有竞争，也应是良性竞争。我们要相互信任，并肩前行。, 第三，坚持同舟共济，破解和平赤字。人类今天所处的安全环境仍然堪忧，地区冲突和局部战争持续不断，恐怖主义仍然猖獗，不少国家民众特别是儿童饱受战火摧残。我们要秉持共同、综合、合作、可持续的新安全观，摒弃冷战思维、零和博弈的旧思维，摒弃弱肉强食的丛林法则，以合作谋和平、以合作促安全，坚持以和平方式解决争端，反对动辄使用武力或以武力相威胁，反对为一己之私挑起事端、激化矛盾，反对以邻为壑、损人利己，各国一起走和平发展道路，实现世界长久和平。, 第四，坚持互利共赢，破解发展赤字。经济全球化是推动世界经济增长的引擎。当前，逆全球化思潮正在发酵，保护主义的负面效应日益显现，收入分配不平等、发展空间不平衡已成为全球经济治理面临的最突出问题。我们要坚持创新驱动，打造富有活力的增长模式；坚持协同联动，打造开放共赢的合作模式；坚持公平包容，打造平衡普惠的发展模式，让世界各国人民共享经济全球化发展成果。中国支持对世界贸易组织进行必要的改革，更好建设开放型世界经济，维护多边贸易体制，引导经济全球化更加健康发展。“一带一路”倡议丰富了国际经济合作理念和多边主义内涵，为促进世界经济增长、实现共同发展提供了重要途径。我们欢迎包括法国在内的世界各国积极参与到共建“一带一路”中来。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中法友谊源远流长。今年是中法建交55周年。两国已经开展了许多战略性合作，还有很大合作空间。正如法国朋友所说，不登上埃菲尔铁塔，就看不到巴黎最美的风景。新形势下，我们应登高望远，面向未来，加强合作。我们要深化核能、航空航天、农业食品、医疗卫生、汽车制造等传统领域合作，加快推动绿色制造、数字经济、人工智能、金融服务、城市可持续发展等新兴领域合作，加强气候变化合作，全面落实《巴黎协定》，推动今年联合国气候峰会取得积极成果，为两国人民和各国人民谋福祉。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 历史发展、文明繁盛、人类进步，从来离不开思想引领。中法全球治理论坛将为两国共同参与和推进全球治理提供有力智力支撑。我希望，中法双方及相关各方保持对话渠道畅通，以交流促合作，以合作促共赢，携手为建设更加美好的地球家园贡献智慧和力量！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社巴黎3月26日电）, ]",习近平在中法全球治理论坛闭幕式上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30997013
7,23,"[, On March 20th, on the eve of a state visit to the Italian Republic, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Evening Post in Italy titled ""The Story of East-West Communication"" and the Continuation of the Chinese-Italian Friendship. The article reads as follows: The East-West Friendship Stories Continuation of China-Italy Friendship, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China is very pleased to pay a state visit to the Italian Republic at the invitation of President Matarera at the time when Vientiane is updated. In 2011, I attended the “150th Anniversary of Italian Reunification” celebration in Rome. In 2016, I crossed Sardinia. Italy has impressed me with a combination of ancient and modern, classic and innovative lifestyle and industrial ideas. I am about to set foot in this beautiful country again, and I feel very cordial to meet warm Italian friends. , China and Italy are outstanding representatives of Eastern and Western civilizations, leaving an indelible chapter in the history of the development of human civilization. As the birthplace of ancient Roman civilization and the cradle of the Renaissance, Italy's magnificent and magnificent historical monuments and magnificent masterpieces of literary and artistic masters are widely known in China. The friendly exchanges between the two great civilizations of China and Italy have a long history. As early as more than two thousand years ago, the ancient Silk Road linked China and ancient Rome, thousands of miles away. The Han dynasty once sent the messenger Gan Ying to look for ""Great Qin"". The ancient Roman poet Virgil and geographer Pomponius repeatedly referred to ""the kingdom of silk"". A ""Marco Polo Travels"" set off the first ""China fever"" in the history of the West. Marco Polo became the forerunner of cultural exchange between East and West, and was followed by friendly envoys from generation to generation. Entering the contemporary era, along the footsteps of friendly exchanges between the ancients, China-Italy relations have continuously renewed their vitality. In 1970, the People’s Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the Italian Republic. In 2020, the two countries will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, no matter how the international situation changes, the two countries have always trusted each other and cooperated closely, setting a model of mutual benefit and win-win for countries with different social systems, cultural backgrounds, and stages of development. The strong traditional friendship between China and Italy has lasted for a long time and has become a solid pillar for the rapid and stable development of bilateral relations. , ——Sino-Italian friendship is rooted in a profound historical accumulation. The history of more than two thousand years of exchange has cultivated the common concept of mutual respect, mutual learning, mutual trust and mutual understanding between China and Italy, and has become a guarantee for the long-lasting and continuous consolidation of the traditional friendship between the two countries. Facing the changes and challenges in today's world, the two countries have learned valuable experience from the vicissitudes of history and jointly imagined the establishment of a new international relationship of mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation, and a beautiful vision of a community of shared future for mankind. , ——Sino-Italian friendship is condensed in deep strategic mutual trust. The leaders of the two countries insist on viewing and developing bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective. Since the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries in 2004, the two sides have played a leading and promoting role in high-level exchanges, and have mutual understanding and firm support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, which has become a solid backing for ensuring the long-term stable development of China-Italy relations. , ——Sino-Italian friendship is embodied in rich and pragmatic cooperation. China and Italy are important trading and investment partners of each other, and the interests of the two countries are deeply integrated. In 2018, the bilateral trade volume exceeded US$50 billion, and the cumulative two-way investment exceeded US$20 billion. ""Made in Italy"" is synonymous with high-quality products. Italian fashion and furniture are widely favored by Chinese consumers, and pizza and tiramisu are popular among teenagers. The good news of cooperation between the two countries in the fields of satellites, manned spaceflight and other fields has spread frequently. The activities of China-Italy Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Week, joint police patrol, football training and other activities were warmly welcomed by the people of the two countries. , ——Sino-Italian friendship is inherited in close cultural exchanges. The people of China and Italy have a strong interest in studying each other's culture. A Chinese professor began to translate Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" in the age of sparseness, and his draft was changed several times. It lasted 18 years and was finally completed on the deathbed. Italian sinologists are emerging endlessly, building bridges for China-Europe exchanges. From Wei Kuangguo, who wrote the first Chinese grammar book in the West, to Bai Zuoliang and Masini, who wrote ""Italy and China,"" helped the ""Chinese Studies fever"" on the Apennine peninsula last forever. , Italian famous writer Moravia wrote: ""Friendship is not an accidental choice, but the result of like-minded."" The world today is facing a major change that has not happened in a century. Raising China-Italy relations to a new higher level and jointly safeguarding world peace, stability, development and prosperity is the responsibility entrusted to us by history. Through this visit, I would like to work with Italian leaders to draw a blueprint for Sino-Italian relations and lead China-Italy relations into a new era. , We are willing to agree that the parties enhance comprehensive strategic partnership, close high-level exchanges, strengthen cooperation at all levels of the government, parliament, political parties, and localities, strengthen policy communication, and enhance strategic mutual trust and strategic dockingStrategic partnership, close high-level exchanges, strengthen cooperation at all levels of government, parliament, political parties, and localities, strengthen policy communication, enhance strategic mutual trust and strategic docking, continue to understand and support each other’s core interests and major concerns, and consolidate the political foundation of bilateral relations. , We are willing to agree to build the “Belt and Road” together, make use of the historical, cultural and geographical advantages of the two countries’ “Belt and Road” cooperation, and link the “Belt and Road” construction with Italy’s “Northern Port Construction Plan” and “Invest in Italy Plan” ""Docking, etc., to create the ""Belt and Road"" in the new era in multiple dimensions such as sea, land, aviation, aerospace and culture. , We are willing to agree to expand the field of practical cooperation. China will expand its opening to the outside world and share China’s market opportunities with other countries including Italy through the annual China International Import Expo. The two sides can tap into the potential for cooperation in the fields of port logistics, shipping, energy, telecommunications, and medicine, and encourage companies from both countries to cooperate in third-party markets to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results. , We are willing to agree that Fang will have close humanities exchanges. As the two countries with the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites, China and Italy have rich cultural and tourist resources. The two sides should strengthen the relationship between the two countries’ world heritage sites, encourage cultural institutions and individuals of the two countries to hold high-level cultural relics and art exhibitions, jointly film and shoot film and television works, strengthen language teaching, promote personnel exchanges, and contribute to the diversity of world civilizations and the exchange of different cultures. Jian made new contributions. , We are willing to agree that the parties strengthen international affairs and coordination within multilateral organizations. China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation on major issues such as global governance, climate change, United Nations reform, and World Trade Organization reform within the framework of the United Nations, the G20, the Asia-Europe Meeting, and the World Trade Organization, and safeguard common interests. To promote multilateralism and free trade and maintain world peace, stability, development and prosperity. , Looking back 50 years, China-Italy relations have been deeply cultivated and fruitful.

8,132,"[, Dear Heads of State, Heads of Government, High Representatives, Heads of International Organizations, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning, 　　 Good morning! ""A lot of good spring and autumn days, ascend new poetry."" In this beautiful spring season, I am very pleased to join the guests to attend the second ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all guests! , 　　 Two years ago, we held the first summit forum here to plan a blueprint for cooperation in policy communication, facility connectivity, trade smoothness, capital and finance, and people-to-people communication. Today, friends from all over the world meet again. I look forward to working with you, ascending the horizon, moving forward, and jointly creating a bright future for the “Belt and Road”. , 　　 colleagues, friends! , 　　To jointly build the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, the purpose is to focus on interconnection and interoperability, deepen pragmatic cooperation, work together to meet the various risks and challenges facing humanity, and achieve mutual benefit, win-win and common development. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the interconnection structure of ""six corridors, six roads, multiple countries and ports"" has basically taken shape, a large number of cooperation projects have taken root, and the results of the first summit forum have been successfully implemented. More than 150 countries and international organizations have signed with China Establish a “Belt and Road” cooperation agreement. The joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative is linked to the development and cooperation planning of international and regional organizations such as the United Nations, ASEAN, African Union, European Union, and Eurasian Economic Union, and to the development strategies of various countries. From the Eurasian continent to Africa, the Americas and Oceania, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” has opened up new space for world economic growth, built a new platform for international trade and investment, expanded new practices for the improvement of global economic governance, and improved the livelihood of all countries. Welfare has made new contributions to become a common road of opportunity and prosperity. Facts have proved that the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" has not only provided new opportunities for the development of all countries in the world, but also opened up a new world for China's open development. , 　　The ancient Chinese said: ""Everything gets its own life, and everything gets its way."" The joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" is in line with the historical trend of economic globalization, the era of global governance system changes, and the people of all countries. Strong desire for a better life. Facing the future, we should focus on the key points, work hard, work together to draw precise and delicate ""work drawing"", and promote the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" along the direction of high-quality development. , 　　——We must uphold the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, and advocate multilateralism. Everyone should discuss everything, and promote the various directors of the various parties to do their best. Through bilateral cooperation, tripartite cooperation, multilateral cooperation, etc. Form, give full play to everyone's advantages and potentials, gather sand into towers, and build up water into abyss. , 　　——We must adhere to the concept of openness, greenness, and cleanliness, do not engage in closed small circles, use green as a background, promote green infrastructure construction, green investment, and green finance, protect the common homeland on which we live, and adhere to All cooperation operates in the sun, and fight corruption with zero tolerance. We launched the ""Beijing Initiative on the Clean Silk Road"" and we are willing to work with all parties to build a silk road with integrity. , 　　——We must strive to achieve high standards, benefit people's livelihood, and sustainable goals, introduce rules and standards that are generally supported by all parties, and promote enterprises to follow generally accepted international rules and standards in project construction, operation, procurement, bidding, etc. At the same time, we must respect the laws and regulations of various countries. We must adhere to the people-centered development concept, focus on eliminating poverty, increasing employment, and improving people's livelihood, so that the results of the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" will better benefit all people, and make real contributions to local economic and social development, while ensuring business and Financial sustainability is to achieve a good start and a good end. , 　　 colleagues, friends! , 　　 The joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" is the key to interconnection. We should build a global interconnection partnership to achieve common development and prosperity. I believe that as long as you work together and help each other, even if there are thousands of mountains and rivers apart, you will be able to walk out of a road of mutual benefit and win-win situation.　　Infrastructure is the cornerstone of interconnection and interconnection, and the bottleneck faced by many countries in development. Building high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, reasonably priced, and inclusive infrastructure is conducive to countries to give full play to their resource endowments, better integrate into global supply chains, industrial chains, and value chains, and achieve joint development. China will continue to work hard with all parties to build an interconnection led by the New Asia-Europe Continental Bridge and other economic corridors, with large channels such as China-Europe trains, new land and sea passages, and information highways as the framework, and relying on railways, ports, and pipeline networks. Interworking network. We will continue to play a special loan for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”Roads and information highways are skeletons, and interconnected networks relying on railways, ports, and pipeline networks. We will continue to play the role of jointly building the “Belt and Road” special loans, Silk Road funds, and various special investment funds, develop Silk Road themed bonds, and support the effective operation of multilateral development financing cooperation centers. We welcome multilateral and national financial institutions to participate in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” investment and financing, encourage third-party market cooperation, and achieve the goal of mutual benefit through multi-party participation. , 　　 Circulation of commodities, capital, technology, and personnel can provide strong momentum and broad space for economic growth. ""The rivers and seas do not choose small currents, so they can be deep."" If the flow of rivers is artificially blocked, no matter how big the sea is, it will dry up sooner or later. We must promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, clearly stand against protectionism, and promote economic globalization in a direction that is more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win. We will sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, strengthen cooperation in customs, taxation, auditing and other fields, establish a joint construction of the “Belt and Road” tax collection and management cooperation mechanism, and accelerate the promotion of international mutual recognition cooperation of “certified operators” . We have also formulated the “Belt and Road” Financing Guiding Principles and issued the “Belt and Road” Debt Sustainability Analysis Framework to provide guidance for co-building the “Belt and Road” financing cooperation. China will hold the second China International Import Expo this year to build a broader platform for all parties to enter the Chinese market. , 　　Innovation is productivity, enterprises rely on it, and the country depends on it to flourish. We must follow the development trend of the fourth industrial revolution, jointly grasp the development opportunities of digitalization, networking, and intelligence, jointly explore new technologies, new formats, and new models, explore new growth momentum and development paths, and build digital silk roads and innovations. The Silk Road. China will continue to implement the ""Belt and Road"" technology innovation action plan, work with all parties to promote scientific and technological humanities exchanges, jointly build joint laboratories, science and technology park cooperation, and technology transfer. We will actively implement innovative talent exchange projects and support 5,000 Chinese and foreign innovative talents to carry out exchanges, training, and cooperative research in the next five years. We will also support the cooperation of enterprises from various countries to promote the construction of information and communication infrastructure and enhance the level of network connectivity. , 　　 unbalanced development is the biggest unbalance in the world today. In the process of co-building the “Belt and Road”, we must always look at issues from the perspective of development, and integrate the concept of sustainable development into all aspects of project selection, implementation, and management. We are committed to strengthening international development cooperation, creating more development opportunities and space for developing countries, and helping them get rid of poverty and achieve sustainable development. To this end, we work with all parties to build the “One Belt, One Road” Sustainable Cities Alliance and the International Alliance for Green Development, formulate the “One Belt, One Road” Green Investment Principles, and initiate cooperation on “caring for children, sharing development, and promoting the achievement of sustainable development goals” initiative. We started to jointly build a “Belt and Road” ecological and environmental big data service platform. We will continue to implement the Green Silk Road Messenger program and work with relevant countries to implement the “Belt and Road” climate change South-South cooperation plan. We will also deepen cooperation in agriculture, health, disaster reduction, water resources and other fields, strengthen cooperation with the United Nations in the field of development, and strive to narrow the development gap. , 　　 We should actively build bridges between different civilizations and learn from each other, deepen humanities cooperation in education, science, culture, sports, tourism, health, archaeology and other fields, strengthen exchanges between parliaments, political parties, and non-governmental organizations, and strengthen women, youth, and disability People and other groups communicate to form a multi-interactive humanities exchange pattern. In the next five years, China will invite 10,000 representatives including political parties, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations that jointly build the “Belt and Road” countries to come to China for exchanges. We will encourage and support the social organizations of the countries along the route to carry out extensive cooperation in people's livelihood, jointly carry out a series of training projects in the fields of environmental protection and anti-corruption, and deepen cooperation in human resources development in various fields.

We will also set up mechanisms to jointly build the “Belt and Road” International Think Tank Cooperation Committee and the News Cooperation Alliance to bring together the wisdom and strength of all parties. , 　　 colleagues, friends! , 　　 This year is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Seventy years ago, after several generations of Chinese people searching up and down, they finally established a new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Chinese people have stood up since then, and the fate of the Chinese people has been in their own hands.　　After 70 years of hard work, the Chinese people based on their national conditions and constantly explored the way forward in practice, opening up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. China today has stood at a new historical starting point. We know that despite the glorious achievements, there are mountains ahead that need to be crossed, and there are still dangerous beaches waiting for the trek. IStand at a new historical starting point. We know that despite the glorious achievements, there are mountains ahead that need to be crossed, and there are still dangerous beaches waiting for the trek. We will continue to make great strides along the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to comprehensive deepening of reform, adhere to high-quality development, adhere to expanding opening to the outside world, adhere to the path of peaceful development, and promote the building of a community of shared future for mankind. Next, China will take a series of major reform and opening-up measures, strengthen institutional and structural arrangements, and promote a higher level of opening up. , 　　 First, expand access to foreign markets in a wider area. Fair competition can increase efficiency and bring prosperity. China has implemented a pre-entry national treatment plus negative list management model. In the future, it will continue to significantly reduce the negative list, promote the all-round opening of modern service industries, manufacturing, and agriculture, and allow foreign-controlled or wholly-owned operations in more areas. We will newly deploy a number of free trade pilot zones and speed up the exploration and construction of free trade ports. We will accelerate the formulation of supporting regulations to ensure strict implementation of the ""Foreign Investment Law"". We will promote domestic supply-side structural reform with fair competition and open cooperation, effectively eliminate backward and excess capacity, and improve the quality and efficiency of the supply system. , 　　 Second, make greater efforts to strengthen international cooperation in intellectual property protection. Without innovation, there is no progress. Strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights is not only the need to protect the legitimate rights and interests of domestic and foreign-funded enterprises, but also an inherent requirement to promote the construction of an innovative country and promote high-quality development. China will strive to create a business environment that respects the value of knowledge, comprehensively improve the intellectual property protection legal system, vigorously strengthen law enforcement, strengthen the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign intellectual property owners, eliminate mandatory technology transfer, improve business secret protection, and severely crack down on intellectual property according to law Infringement. China is willing to strengthen cooperation in intellectual property protection with countries around the world, create a good innovation ecological environment, and promote technical exchange and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the principle of marketization and rule of law. , 　　 Third, increase imports of goods and services on a larger scale. China is both a ""world factory"" and a ""world market"". China has the world's largest and fastest-growing middle-income group, with huge potential for consumption growth. In order to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people and increase consumer choice and welfare, we will further reduce tariff levels, eliminate various non-tariff barriers, keep opening the door to the big Chinese market, and welcome high-quality products from countries around the world. We are not deliberately pursuing a trade surplus and are willing to import more competitive high-quality agricultural products, manufactured products and services from abroad to promote balanced development of trade. , 　　 Fourth, more effective implementation of international macroeconomic policy coordination. A globalized economy requires global governance. China will strengthen macro-policy coordination with major economies in the world, strive to create positive spillover effects, and jointly promote a strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth of the world economy. China does not engage in the depreciation of the exchange rate that is neighbor-negative. It will continue to improve the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism, make the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, maintain the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level, and promote world economic stability. Rules and credit are the cornerstones of the effective operation of the international governance system and the prerequisite for the development of international economic and trade relations. China actively supports and participates in WTO reforms and jointly builds a higher level of international economic and trade rules. , 　　 Fifth, pay more attention to the implementation of the policy of opening to the outside world. The Chinese have always emphasized ""one promise, one gold"". We attach great importance to the implementation of multilateral and bilateral economic and trade agreements reached with various countries, strengthen the construction of a government ruled by law and a credible government, establish a binding international agreement implementation mechanism, amend and improve laws and regulations in accordance with the needs of wider opening, in terms of administrative licensing, market supervision, etc. Regulate the behavior of governments at all levels, clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations, subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market, treat all enterprises and operators fairly, and improve the marketization, rule of law, and convenient business environment.　　 China's measures to expand opening up are independent choices made in accordance with the objective needs of China's reform and development. This is conducive to promoting high-quality economic development, meeting people's longing for a better life, and contributing to world peace, stability, and development.
