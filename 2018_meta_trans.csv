3,24,"[, People's Daily Beijing, December 3rd. On December 3rd, on the eve of a state visit to the Portuguese Republic, President Xi Jinping published a signed article titled ""Friendship across Time and Space and Future-oriented Partners"" in the Portuguese ""News Daily"". The article is as follows:, Friendship across time and space, future-oriented partner, President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, ""Lu stops here, the sea begins in Si"", the famous poems of Portugal’s ""Poetry Soul"" Carmons from generation to generation vividly depicts his homeland. In a privileged location. Twenty years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Portugal, and in 2014 I crossed the island of Terceira. At the invitation of President De Souza, I will once again set foot on this fertile soil and feel sincerely happy to pay a state visit to your country. In recent years, Portugal has successfully responded to the challenges of the European sovereign debt crisis, achieved important achievements in the development of the national economy, the promotion of national culture, and the promotion of social progress, and the ancient land has continuously rejuvenated. As a sincere friend of the Portuguese people, the Chinese people admire this. Although China and Portugal are located at the east and west ends of the Asia-Europe continent, the friendship between the two peoples has a long history and lasts for a long time. Hundreds of years ago, Chinese blue and white porcelain floated across the ocean and came to Portugal. It merged with local porcelain production technology to form a unique ""Portuguese blue"". The city of Fresso in northeastern Portugal used the silkworm weaving technology from China for a long time, enjoying the reputation of ""the hometown of silk"". In the contemporary era, stories of friendly exchanges between the two peoples are constantly emerging. A couple of old Chinese teachers overcame the difficulties of the disease and taught Chinese and spread Chinese culture in Portugal for decades. Many excellent Portuguese football coaches and players went to the Chinese club to teach or play football. ""Portuguese egg tarts baked by Chinese chefs have become a new culinary choice for ordinary people."" There are still many such stories, witnessing the friendship between the two peoples across time and space. , China and Portugal established diplomatic relations in February 1979. In two months, the two countries will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. For 40 years, Sino-Portuguese relations have maintained steady and rapid development, and have gone through an extraordinary course. The two sides have always trusted each other, respected each other, and helped each other, becoming a model of win-win cooperation between different social systems, historical backgrounds, and countries of all sizes in the world. For 40 years, the two sides have insisted on viewing the relationship between the two countries from a strategic and long-term perspective. In 1999, through peaceful consultations, the two countries properly resolved the Macao issues left over from history and opened up a new era in the development of Macao and a new era of Sino-Portuguese relations. In 2005, the two countries established a comprehensive strategic partnership. The high-level exchanges between the two sides have been frequent, political mutual trust has been deepened, pragmatic cooperation in various fields has achieved fruitful results, and Sino-Portuguese friendship and cooperation have entered the fast track of development. In the past 40 years, the two sides have adhered to the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and win-win cooperation to carry out practical cooperation. After the 2008 international financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, the Chinese government and the Portuguese government worked together to resist risks and cope with challenges. Chinese companies are actively investing in Portugal, creating jobs for the local area and providing assistance for the economic and social development of Portugal, while also expanding their overseas business. In the past 40 years, the two sides have adhered to the concept of exchange and mutual learning and common progress to promote people-to-people exchanges. At the beginning of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the number of exchange visits between the two countries was very small. Currently, there are more than 300,000 two-way personnel exchanges each year. Currently, 17 universities in China have set up Portuguese courses; Portugal has opened 4 Confucius Institutes and many have set up Chinese courses. The close exchanges between the two sides in the fields of film and television media, performances and exhibitions, and local folks have laid the foundation for public opinion for the long-term development of bilateral relations. At present, both China and Portugal are at a critical stage of their development. China is comprehensively deepening reforms and expanding opening up. Portugal is also working hard to seek greater development. China is willing to work with Portugal to continue to deepen mutual understanding and trust, continuously expand the depth and breadth of pragmatic cooperation, further enrich the connotation of China-Portugal comprehensive strategic partnership, and jointly create a better tomorrow for China-Portugal relations. First, strengthen high-level exchanges and be friends of mutual respect and trust. We support the two governments, parliaments, and political parties to maintain regular exchanges and policy communication. Both sides must always understand and respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and provide a firm political guarantee for the long-term development of bilateral relations. China hopes and believes that Portugal will continue to play an active role in the EU and promote China-EU partnership for peace, growth, reform and civilization. Secondly, jointly build the “Belt and Road” and be a partner for joint development. Portugal is an important hub connecting the Silk Road on the land and the Silk Road on the sea. The cooperation between China and Portugal on the “Belt and Road” initiative has natural advantages. Both sides should take the opportunity of jointly building the ""Belt and Road"" to continue to grow bigger and strongerAn important hub of the road, China and Portugal have natural advantages in carrying out the “Belt and Road” cooperation. The two sides should take the opportunity of jointly building the “Belt and Road” to continue to enlarge and strengthen existing projects, make good use of platforms such as China International Import Expo, expand bilateral trade exchanges, and create more in the fields of port construction, automobiles, new energy, finance, etc. Cooperation growth points, strengthen third-party market cooperation, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results on a larger scale , Third, deepen cultural exchanges and be a messenger of friendship. The two sides agreed to hold a cultural festival next year and strengthen cooperation in exhibitions, performances, film and television, and media. Both sides should continue to deepen language teaching cooperation and expand the scale of exchanges between foreign students. Both sides should continue to support cooperation between aviation companies of the two countries and create convenient conditions for two-way personnel exchanges. Fourthly, develop marine cooperation and be a pioneer in the ""blue economy"". Portugal is known as the ""hometown of navigation"", with a long marine culture and rich experience in the development and utilization of marine resources. We must actively develop the ""Blue Partnership"" and encourage both sides to strengthen cooperation in marine scientific research, marine development and protection, and port logistics construction to develop a ""blue economy"" so that the vast ocean can benefit future generations. Fifth, close multilateral coordination and be a builder and maintainer of the international system. The two sides have similar and identical positions on many major international and regional issues. China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Portugal on global governance, climate change, and reform of the UN Security Council within the framework of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Both sides must adhere to the common concept of openness and tolerance, support multilateralism and free trade, and jointly promote world peace, stability and prosperity. , Portugal is the last leg of my trip to Europe, Latin America and attend the G20 leaders Buenos Aires summit. On this trip, I crossed the Asian and European continents, visited both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and felt the strong call of the international community to follow the trend of the times, adhere to multilateralism, and improve global governance. People of all countries look forward to peace, peace, development, and a happy life. Good wishes. Facing various problems and challenges in today's world, China firmly believes that only by following mutual respect, consultation on an equal footing, and insisting on peaceful development and win-win cooperation can we achieve long-term stability in the world and common development of mankind. Sino-Portuguese relations are not as good as they are today, and the prospects for Sino-Portuguese cooperation are broad. It is believed that with the joint efforts of both sides, the ships of Sino-Portuguese relations in the new period will be sailing and sailing to a more brilliant future, which will not only bring more well-being to the people of the two countries, but will also be able to make a community for the destiny of humanity.

4,25,"[, People's Daily News, Beijing, November 30th. On November 30th, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Panama, President Xi Jinping published a signed article titled ""Working Together for a Better Future"" in the Panama Star. The article is as follows:, Joining Hands and Creating the Future Together, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Juan Carlos Barrera, I will pay a state visit to the Republic of Panama. This is my first visit to your country and the first visit of a Chinese President to Panama. I am looking forward to this trip. , Like many Chinese, although I have never been close to your country, I am not new to it. The Panama Canal is world-famous, Guixia Coffee is well-known, and tropical fruits such as bananas are world-renowned. In recent years, under the leadership of President Barrera, Panama's economy has developed rapidly, the market is prosperous and active, and the people live and work in peace and contentment. It has gradually become the ""Habitat Paradise"" in the Americas and the ""Golden Land"" in the eyes of many investors. I am happy for this and sincerely wish Panama continuous new and greater achievements on the road of national development. The friendly exchanges between the people of China and Pakistan have continued for more than 160 years. More than 160 years ago, the first Chinese arrived in Panama to help the Panamanian people build railways and dig canals. They finally stayed on this passionate land, actively integrated into the local society, and worked hard with the Panamanian people for happiness. To this end, the Panamanian government specifically set up the ""Chinese Festival"". In the 1960s, the Chinese people firmly supported the Panamanian people in their just struggle to regain sovereignty over the canal. To this end, 16 million people from all over China held parades and rallies, which became an unforgettable memory of that generation of Chinese people. All of this fully shows that the people of the two countries are closely linked with each other. , Last June, President Barrera and I made a major political decision, and China and Pakistan formally established diplomatic relations. For both countries, this is a great event that benefits today and benefits us all. To the world, this is a banner that shows the general trend and the direction of the people. The international community listened to Panama’s just declaration of abiding by the one-China policy, and the two peoples unanimously supported the development of China-Pakistan relations. Over the past year and a half, China-Pakistan relations have started strongly, and cooperation in various fields has sprung up and flourished, bringing tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. President Barrera paid his first state visit to China, and we jointly planned a blueprint for the development of China-Pakistan relations. China maintains Panama's second largest trading partner, Cologne Free Trade Zone's largest supplier, and the Panama Canal's second largest user status. Under the leadership of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, the two sides signed a large number of agreements in the fields of economy and trade, finance, maritime affairs, civil aviation, tourism, culture, and education. Chinese companies and financial institutions have actively participated in the cooperation with Panama, creating thousands of local jobs. The Cologne Safe City project aided by China will effectively maintain the safety of Cologne citizens, and the soon-to-be-completed Amador Convention and Exhibition Center project will become the new venue for the Panama International Expo. Panamanian beef, pineapple, seafood and other special agricultural products are performing quarantine access procedures for export to China. I believe they will soon be put on the tables of thousands of households in China. According to the recommendation of the Pakistani side, China is actively studying the construction of the ""City of Hope"" education center project in western Panama, which will provide education services to more than 2,000 local students and greatly improve the local education environment and quality. The loving mobile clinic project being implemented by China will provide free medical services to women in remote areas of Panama. The first Confucius Institute in Panama officially opened. The first direct flight between China and Central America was successfully opened. Panama became a destination country for Chinese citizens to organize outbound tourism. By the end of this year, China had trained nearly 6,000 officials and technicians in various fields for Pakistan, and nearly 1,000 Panamanian students studying in China. Scholars, think tanks, and news media from the two countries have been in contact with each other to jointly make suggestions and cheer for the development of China-Pakistan relations. The ""China Fever"" and ""Panama Fever"" resonate in the same frequency in the two countries, and the people of the two countries are eager to increase exchanges and mutual understanding. Panama is building a country with interconnectedness and is currently actively promoting the ""National Logistics Strategy 2030"" in an effort to build a world-class logistics center. This strategy coincides with my proposal to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative. China and Pakistan can be said to be natural partners in jointly building the “Belt and Road” initiative. During President Barrera’s visit to China last year, Panama became the first Latin American and Caribbean country to sign a memorandum of understanding on cooperation with China on the “Belt and Road” initiative. Next, we are willing to work with Pakistan to lift up our sleeves and work harder to strengthen the connection between the development strategies of the two countries and better benefit the two peoples. First, we must be sincere partners of equality and mutual trust. Both sides must always view and promote the development of bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, and understand and support each other’s core interests and major concernsSincere partner. Both sides must always view and promote the development of bilateral relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, understand and support each other's core interests and major concerns, and build a political foundation for the long-term healthy and stable development of bilateral relations. Secondly, we must be a development partner who shares our common interests. China and Panama are both developing countries, share the same historical experience, and face common development tasks. Both sides should work together to promote the establishment of a new international relationship of mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation, and to promote the building of a community of shared future for mankind. Both sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation in multilateral occasions such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system, and promote the construction of an open world economy. , Third, we want to be a mutually beneficial and win-win partner. Based on respecting each other’s wishes, taking care of each other’s concerns, and integrating their respective advantages, the two sides should lead the cooperation between the two countries through the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” and continuously deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure construction, logistics, production capacity, e-commerce, and finance. Strive to obtain a batch of early results of pragmatic cooperation as soon as possible to promote the common development of the two countries. We welcome Pakistan to continue to participate in the China International Import Expo and expand the export of Panamanian high-quality products and services to China. , Fourth, we need to be close friends. The two sides should take the people's hearts as the purpose and widely carry out exchanges in various fields such as culture, education, health, tourism, and news to promote the great development of social friendship between the two countries. China and Pakistan have opened direct air routes, and look forward to the strengthening of exchanges between the two peoples to enhance mutual understanding and friendship. There are 280,000 Chinese in Panama, and both sides should play a role in this blood relationship to make China-Pakistan friendship more popular. The trend of the times is rolling forward, and the development of the world is constantly changing. Although China and Pakistan are far apart and have very different national conditions, they both have people with a spirit of struggle, creativity, and dream-catching spirit. The development of China-Pakistan relations is inseparable from the participation of the two peoples. Let us seize the opportunity together, only fight for the day and night, make China-Pakistan relations overtake in the corners, and then take the upper hand, make the cooperation between the two countries stable and far-reaching, and make new contributions to building a better future and a more prosperous world. , ""People's Daily"" (01 December 2018, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes a signed article in Panamanian media: work together for a better future,2181,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-12-01,"[, 　　人民网北京11月30日电  11月30日，在对巴拿马共和国进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在巴拿马《星报》发表题为《携手前进，共创未来》的署名文章。文章如下：, 　　携手前进，共创未来, 　　中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 　　应胡安·卡洛斯·巴雷拉总统邀请，我即将对巴拿马共和国进行国事访问。这是我首次访问贵国，也是中国国家主席首次到访巴拿马，我对此行充满期待。, 　　同很多中国人一样，我对贵国虽未曾亲至，但并不感陌生。巴拿马运河举世闻名，瑰夏咖啡声名远播，香蕉等热带水果享誉世界。近年来，在巴雷拉总统领导下，巴拿马经济快速发展，市场繁荣活跃，人民安居乐业，逐渐成为美洲的“人居天堂”和众多投资者眼中的“黄金热土”。我为此感到高兴，并衷心祝愿巴拿马在国家发展道路上不断取得新的更大成就。, 　　中巴两国人民的友好交往已延续160多年。160多年前，首批华人抵达巴拿马，帮助巴拿马人民修铁路、挖运河，最后留在了这片热情的土地上，积极融入当地社会，同巴拿马人民一道为了幸福而努力奋斗。为此，巴拿马政府专门设立了“华人节”。上世纪60年代，中国人民坚定声援巴拿马人民收回运河主权的正义斗争。为此，中国全国各地1600万人举行游行集会，成为那一代中国人难忘的记忆。这些都充分表明，两国人民血脉相连，心心相印。, 　　去年6月，我和巴雷拉总统共同作出重大政治决断，中巴正式建交。对两国，这是一件功在当今、利在千秋的盛事。对世界，这是一面昭示大势所趋、人心所向的旗帜。国际社会倾听巴拿马恪守一个中国政策的正义宣言，两国人民一致支持中巴关系发展。, 　　一年半来，中巴关系强劲起步，各领域合作如雨后春笋般破土而出、茁壮成长，给两国人民带来了实实在在的利益。巴雷拉总统对中国进行首次国事访问，我们共同规划了中巴关系发展蓝图。中国保持巴拿马第二大贸易伙伴、科隆自由贸易区第一大供货国、巴拿马运河第二大用户地位。双方以共建“一带一路”为统领，签署经贸、金融、海事、民航、旅游、文化、教育等领域大量协议。中国企业和金融机构积极参与对巴拿马合作，为当地创造了数以千计的就业机会。中国援建的科隆平安城市项目将有效维护科隆市民安全，即将完工的阿玛多尔会展中心项目将成为巴拿马国际博览会新会址。巴拿马牛肉、菠萝、海产品等特色农产品正在履行输华检疫准入程序，相信很快就能摆上中国千家万户的餐桌。, 　　根据巴方建议，中方正积极研究在巴拿马西部援建“希望之城”教育中心项目，将为2000多名当地学生提供教育服务，极大改善当地教育环境和质量。中方正在实施的爱心移动诊所项目将为巴拿马边远地区妇女提供免费医疗服务。巴拿马第一所孔子学院正式开课，中国和中美洲之间首条直航航线成功开通，巴拿马成为中国公民组团出境旅游目的地国。截至今年年底，中方共为巴方培养各领域官员和技术人员近6000人，近千名巴拿马学生在华学习。两国学者、智库、新闻媒体往来热络，共同为中巴关系发展建言献策、加油鼓劲。“中国热”和“巴拿马热”在两国同频共振，两国民众对增进彼此交流和相互认知的渴望势如泉涌。, 　　巴拿马以互联互通立国，当前正积极推进“2030年国家物流战略”，力求打造世界级物流中心。这一战略同我提出的共建“一带一路”倡议不谋而合。中巴可以说是共建“一带一路”的天然合作伙伴。去年巴雷拉总统访华期间，巴拿马成为首个同中方签署“一带一路”合作谅解备忘录的拉美和加勒比国家。接下来，我们愿同巴方一道，撸起袖子加油干，加强两国发展战略对接，更好造福两国人民。, 　　第一，我们要做平等互信的真诚伙伴。双方要始终从战略高度和长远角度看待和推动双边关系发展，相互理解和支持彼此核心利益和重大关切，为两国关系长期健康稳定发展筑牢政治基础。, 　　第二，我们要做休戚与共的发展伙伴。中国和巴拿马同为发展中国家，有着相同历史遭遇，面临共同的发展任务。双方要同心协力，推动构建相互尊重、公平正义、合作共赢的新型国际关系，推动构建人类命运共同体。双方要加强在联合国、世界贸易组织等多边场合的协调和配合，共同维护多边贸易体制，推动建设开放型世界经济。, 　　第三，我们要做互利共赢的合作伙伴。双方要在尊重彼此意愿、照顾对方关切、整合各自优势基础上，以共建“一带一路”统领两国合作，不断深化中巴基础设施建设、物流、产能、电子商务、金融等重点领域合作，争取尽快取得一批务实合作的早期收获，促进两国共同发展。我们欢迎巴方继续参加中国国际进口博览会，扩大巴拿马优质产品和服务对华出口。, 　　第四，我们要做心贴着心的亲密伙伴。双方要以民心相通为宗旨，广泛开展文化、教育、卫生、旅游、新闻等各领域交流，带动两国社会友好大发展。中巴已经开通空中直航航线，期待两国人民加强往来，增进相互了解和友谊。巴拿马有28万华人，双方要发挥好这条血缘纽带的作用，让中巴友好更加深入人心。, 　　时代潮流滚滚向前，世界发展常变常新。中巴两国虽然相距遥远、国情千差万别，但都拥有极具奋斗精神、创造精神、追梦精神的人民。中巴关系发展离不开两国人民参与。让我们一起抓住机遇，只争朝夕，使中巴关系实现弯道超车、后来居上，使两国合作行稳致远，为建设更加美好的未来和更加繁荣的世界不断作出新贡献。, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2018年12月01日 01 版）, ]",习近平在巴拿马媒体发表署名文章：携手前进，共创未来,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30435823
5,26,"[, People's Daily News, Beijing, November 28th. On November 28th, on the eve of attending the G20 leaders’ Buenos Aires summit and paying a state visit to the Argentine Republic, State President Xi Jinping published in Argentina’s Clarion A signed article entitled ""Creating a New Era of China-Arab Relations"". The article is as follows:, Initiating a New Era of China-Arab Relations, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, I am very happy to be invited by President Mauricio Macri to attend the G20 leaders in Buenos Aires Liz summit and state visit to the Argentine Republic. , ""The confidants in the sea and the neighbors are close to each other."" Although the two countries are far apart, the two peoples love peace and know each other. The relationship between the two countries has withstood the test of international changes, and has become a model of unity, cooperation and common development in emerging market countries and developing countries. , ——China and Afghanistan are good friends who trust each other. In just over two years, I have met with President Macri four times and reached important consensus on the development of bilateral relations. I also feel that both parties attach great importance to the development of China-Arab relations. China firmly supports Argentina's exploration of a development path that suits its national conditions and has full confidence in Argentina's future development. At present, the China-Arab Standing Committee, the Economic Cooperation and Coordination Strategic Dialogue, the Parliamentary Political Dialogue Committee, and the Mixed Economic and Trade Committee and other mechanisms are running smoothly, injecting strong momentum into the continuous progress of bilateral relations. China and Afghanistan have always supported each other on issues such as respecting sovereignty and maintaining territorial integrity. -China and Afghanistan are good partners for common development. At present, China is Argentina's second largest trading partner and the largest agricultural export destination. In 2017, the bilateral trade volume was US$13.8 billion, an increase of nearly 2300 times compared with when the establishment of diplomatic relations. Argentine fresh fruits, beef, red wine, seafood, etc. are welcomed by Chinese consumers. China has invested more than US$10 billion in Argentina, covering infrastructure construction, energy, communications, agriculture and other fields, creating tens of thousands of jobs. Made in China and Chinese technology help Argentina achieve better interconnection and improve competitiveness. China and Argentina expand the scale of local currency swaps, Chinese financial institutions set up branches in Argentina, and financial cooperation provides support and services for Argentina's economic and social development. , ——China-Arab is an eclectic good friend. The Argentine has two pairs of feet that he is proud of, one pair is used to play football, and the other pair is used to dance tango. At present, many Argentine players and coaches have joined the Chinese Football League, and a large number of Chinese teenagers have gone to Argentina for football training. Many cities in China have established tango dance associations and clubs. Chinese players have participated in the Tango World Championships and have won many awards. The ""China fever"" and ""Chinese fever"" are still on the rise in Argentina. Literary master Borges has repeatedly mentioned Chinese elements such as Zhuang Zhou Mengdie and the Great Wall in his work ""Lacquer Cane"" and has a beloved Chinese lacquer cane. This year, more than 800,000 Argentine citizens participated in the Spring Festival temple fair held locally, and the Confucius Institute and the public full-time Chinese and Western bilingual schools were all packed. Both sides are continuously optimizing flight connections to facilitate more Chinese tourists to appreciate the charm of Argentina's glaciers, waterfalls and Gaucho culture. The world today is undergoing a major change that has not been seen in a century. The momentum of world multi-polarization and economic globalization is unstoppable, and the increasingly frequent global challenges cannot be ignored. China and Afghanistan are at a critical stage of their respective development. The Chinese people are making unremitting efforts to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the Argentine people are also making efforts to realize the development and revitalization of the Argentine dream. Let us seize the historical opportunity, follow the trend of the times, and work together to create a new era of China-Arab comprehensive strategic partnership to better benefit the two peoples. , First, strengthen strategic communication and uphold mutual respect and trust. Plan a blueprint for the development of relations between the two countries with a broader perspective, strengthen exchanges at all levels in various fields such as government, parliament, political parties, and localities, and closely exchange experience in governing and governing the country, and constantly enhance mutual understanding and political mutual trust. We continue to support each other firmly on issues of concern. Second, deepen pragmatic cooperation and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. Strengthen the connection between the development strategies of the two countries and jointly promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. Continuously deepen cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure construction, energy, agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, promote trade facilitation arrangements, and make good use of new cooperation models such as e-commerce. We welcome Algeria to continue to participate in China International Import Expo and expand exports to China. Expect more Argentine high-value-added products and services to enter the Chinese market, and help Argentina transform from a ""world granary"" to a ""world supermarket"". Third, expand humanities exchanges and strengthen mutual learning and mutual learning. Encourage non-governmental exchanges between the two countries to expand culture, education, science and technology, and local""World Supermarket"" transformation. Third, expand humanities exchanges and strengthen mutual learning and mutual learning. Encourage non-governmental exchanges between the two countries, expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and technology, locality, sports, tourism, etc., implement more measures to facilitate personnel exchanges, share development experience, and lay a solid foundation for China-Arab friendship. , Fourth, strengthen coordination and cooperation, continue to help each other. Strengthen cooperation between the two sides within the multilateral frameworks of the United Nations, the Group of 20, the World Trade Organization, and the Group of 77, support economic globalization and the multilateral trading system, safeguard the fundamental interests of emerging market countries and developing countries, and safeguard world peace 1. Build an open world economy and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The comprehensive and rapid development of China-Arab relations is the epitome of the vigorous vitality of China-Latin America relations. China and Latin America are important representatives of developing countries and emerging market countries, and are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. We need to deepen cooperation and work together. To this end, I propose to build a community of shared destiny between China and Latin America, and propose that China and Latin America paint a new blueprint for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. We are willing to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to uphold the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing. Focusing on cooperation in policy communication, facility connectivity, trade, capital and financial links, and people's hearts, we will bring more benefits to the people of China and Latin America through the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. More affordable, promote the optimization and upgrading, and innovative development of China-Latin America cooperation. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the G20 Leaders Summit. After 10 years of history, the G20 has made remarkable achievements in coping with the international financial crisis and promoting the recovery of the world economy, and has become a stabilizer of the world economy and a propeller of global economic governance. The G20 should continue to play its role as the main forum for international economic cooperation, implement the consensus of previous summits, and lead the way of the world economy. Under the guidance of the theme of ""Consolidating Consensus for Fairness and Sustainable Development"", China will fully support Afghanistan in hosting a successful summit, and is also looking forward to this summit. , I hope that the G20 will continue to uphold the spirit of partnership for the same boat. This spirit has guided the G20 through the ups and downs of the international financial crisis and will continue to inspire the G20 to lead the wave of the world economy. Joining hands to lead the development of the world economy on the right track is not only the original heart of the establishment of the G20, but also the most important task of the G20. We must not only strengthen macro-policy coordination and cooperation, but also clearly maintain the multilateral trading system and promote the construction of an open world economy. , I hope that the G20 will continue to promote the process of economic globalization. President Makri advocated that the G20 should cooperate in accordance with the ""people-centered"" guiding ideology, which China highly appreciates. Economic globalization provides a strong impetus for world economic growth, promotes the flow of commodities and capital, advances in science and technology and civilization, and contacts between peoples of all countries. We must take the initiative and conduct appropriate management of the problems that arise in the process of economic globalization. Starting from the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind, we should practice the concept of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, and promote economic globalization towards greater openness, tolerance, inclusiveness, balance, Development in a win-win direction ensures that all countries and people can benefit. , I hope that the G20 will continue to lead the development path of innovative growth and long-term governance. The opportunities and challenges brought about by new technologies and new formats coexist. Countries need to continue to tap the new driving forces of world economic growth through innovation, and promote the in-depth development of the digital economy and the new industrial revolution. They must also pay attention to the risks and challenges posed by innovation to social employment, and enhance the ability of workers to adapt to technological changes. We must continue to put development issues in a prominent position in global macro-policy coordination, and discuss international cooperation in all fields should always incorporate a development perspective, take into account the concerns of developing countries, and safeguard the development space of developing countries. We must support the construction of infrastructure interconnection, help developing countries break through development bottlenecks, and achieve sustainable development. , ""People's Daily"" (November 29, 2018, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes a signed article in the Argentine media: inaugurating a new era of China-Arab relations,2688,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-11-29,"[, 人民网北京11月28日电  11月28日，在出席二十国集团领导人布宜诺斯艾利斯峰会并对阿根廷共和国进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在阿根廷《号角报》发表题为《开创中阿关系新时代》的署名文章。文章如下：, 开创中阿关系新时代, 中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 在南半球充满希望的阳春时节，我很高兴应毛里西奥·马克里总统邀请，出席二十国集团领导人布宜诺斯艾利斯峰会，并对阿根廷共和国进行国事访问。, “海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”中阿两国虽然相距遥远，但两国人民热爱和平，相知相守。两国关系经历了国际风云变幻考验，成为新兴市场国家和发展中国家团结合作、共同发展的典范。, ——中阿是相互信任的好朋友。短短两年多来，我同马克里总统4次会晤，就双边关系发展达成重要共识，也感受到双方对发展中阿关系的高度重视。中方坚定支持阿根廷探索符合本国国情的发展道路，对阿根廷未来发展充满信心。目前，中阿政府间常设委员会、经济合作与协调战略对话、议会政治对话委员会、经济贸易混合委员会等机制运行顺畅，为两国关系不断取得新进展注入了强劲动力。中阿在尊重主权、维护领土完整等问题上也始终相互支持。, ——中阿是共同发展的好伙伴。目前，中国是阿根廷第二大贸易伙伴、第一大农产品出口目的地国。2017年，双边贸易额138亿美元，与建交时相比，增长近2300倍。阿根廷新鲜水果、牛肉、红酒、海产品等受到中国消费者欢迎。中国在阿根廷投资超过100亿美元，涵盖基础设施建设、能源、通信、农业等领域，创造了数以万计的工作岗位。中国制造、中国技术助力阿根廷更好实现互联互通，提高竞争力。中阿扩大本币互换规模，中国金融机构在阿根廷设立分支机构，金融合作为阿根廷经济社会发展提供了支持和服务。, ——中阿是兼收并蓄的好知音。阿根廷人有引以为豪的两双脚，一双用来踢足球，另一双用来跳探戈。当前，不少阿根廷球员和教练加盟中国足球联赛，成批次的中国青少年赴阿根廷接受足球训练。中国很多城市成立了探戈舞协会和俱乐部，中国选手参加探戈世界锦标赛并屡屡获奖。“中国热”、“汉语热”在阿根廷热度不减。文学巨匠博尔赫斯在《漆手杖》等作品中多次提及庄周梦蝶、长城等中国元素，并且有一根心爱的中国漆手杖。今年，超过80万人次的阿根廷民众参加了在当地举行的春节庙会，孔子学院和公立全日制中西双语学校更是座无虚席。双方还在不断优化航班衔接，便利更多中国游客领略阿根廷冰川、瀑布、高乔文化的魅力。, 当今世界正在经历百年未有之大变局。世界多极化、经济全球化势头不可阻挡，日益频发的全球性挑战也不容忽视。中阿两国正处于各自发展的关键阶段。中国人民正在为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而不懈努力，阿根廷人民也在为实现发展振兴的阿根廷梦而努力。让我们抓住历史机遇，顺应时代潮流，携手开创中阿全面战略伙伴关系新时代，更好造福两国人民。, 第一，加强战略沟通，坚持互尊互信。以更广阔的视野谋划两国关系发展蓝图，加强政府、议会、政党、地方等各领域各层级交往，密切治国理政经验交流，不断增进相互了解和政治互信，在事关彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上继续相互坚定支持。, 第二，深化务实合作，实现互利双赢。加强两国发展战略对接，共同推进“一带一路”建设。不断深化基础设施建设、能源、农业、矿业、制造业等重点领域合作，推进贸易便利化安排，用好电子商务等合作新模式。我们欢迎阿方继续参加中国国际进口博览会，扩大对华出口。期待更多阿根廷高附加值产品及服务进入中国市场，助力阿根廷从“世界粮仓”向“世界超市”转型。, 第三，扩大人文交流，加强互学互鉴。鼓励两国民间往来，扩大文化、教育、科技、地方、体育、旅游等领域交流合作，实施更多便利人员往来的措施，分享发展经验，夯实中阿友好民意基础。, 第四，增强协调配合，继续互帮互助。加强双方在联合国、二十国集团、世界贸易组织、七十七国集团等多边框架内协作，支持经济全球化和多边贸易体制，维护新兴市场国家和广大发展中国家根本利益，为维护世界和平、建设开放型世界经济、推动构建人类命运共同体作出应有贡献。, 中阿关系全面快速发展正是中拉关系蓬勃生机的缩影。中拉是发展中国家和新兴市场国家的重要代表，都面临前所未有的机遇和挑战。我们需要深化合作，携手共进。为此，我提出构建中拉命运共同体，倡议中拉描绘共建“一带一路”新蓝图，得到拉美和加勒比朋友们积极响应。我们愿同拉美和加勒比国家一道，秉持共商共建共享原则，以政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通为合作重点，通过共建“一带一路”给中拉人民带来更多实惠，促进中拉合作优化升级、创新发展。, 今年是二十国集团领导人峰会启动10周年。经过10年历程，二十国集团在应对国际金融危机、推动世界经济复苏方面成绩斐然，成为世界经济的稳定器、全球经济治理的推进器。二十国集团要继续发挥国际经济合作主要论坛作用，落实历届峰会共识，引领世界经济前进方向。中方将在“为公平与可持续发展凝聚共识”主题引领下，全力支持阿方举办一届成功峰会，也对这次峰会充满期待。, 希望二十国集团继续秉持同舟共济的伙伴精神。这种精神曾指引二十国集团走过国际金融危机风雨，也将继续鼓舞二十国集团引领世界经济浪潮。携手引领世界经济在正确轨道上发展，既是二十国集团成立初心所在，也是二十国集团最重要任务。我们既要加强宏观政策协调和合作，更要旗帜鲜明地维护多边贸易体制，推动构建开放型世界经济。, 希望二十国集团继续促进经济全球化发展进程。马克里总统倡导二十国集团要本着“以人民为中心”的指导思想开展合作，中方对此高度赞赏。经济全球化为世界经济增长提供了强劲动力，促进了商品和资本流动、科技和文明进步、各国人民交往。对经济全球化进程中出现的问题，我们要主动作为、适度管理，从构建人类命运共同体出发，践行共商共建共享理念，推动经济全球化朝着更加开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢方向发展，确保所有国家和人民都能受益。, 希望二十国集团继续引领创新增长、长效治理的发展路径。新技术、新业态带来的机遇和挑战并存。各国需要继续通过创新挖掘世界经济增长新动力，推动数字经济、新工业革命深入发展，也要关注创新给社会就业带来的风险挑战，增强劳动者适应技术变革的能力。我们要继续把发展问题置于全球宏观政策协调的突出位置，讨论各领域国际合作都要始终纳入发展视角，照顾发展中国家关切，维护发展中国家发展空间。我们要支持基础设施互联互通建设，帮助发展中国家突破发展瓶颈，实现可持续发展。, 《 人民日报 》（ 2018年11月29日 01 版）, ]",习近平在阿根廷媒体发表署名文章：开创中阿关系新时代,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30431066
6,27,"[, November 27, on a state visit to the Kingdom of Spain, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Spanish newspaper ""Abbesse"" entitled ""Striding into a new era and working together to create brilliant"". The article is as follows:, striding forward into a new era and working together to create brilliant, President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China, I am very pleased to visit the beautiful and rich Kingdom of Spain at the invitation of King Felipe VI. Itinerary of the Group of Leaders Buenos Aires Summit. , The earth is the common home of mankind. At present, the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes. With multi-polarization of the world, economic globalization, social informatization, and cultural diversity developing in depth, human society has become a community of destiny between you and me. At the same time, we are also facing unprecedented challenges, especially the rising protectionism and unilateralism. One of the main tasks of my visit is to discuss with the leaders of the countries and major economies in the world to strengthen the solidarity of the international community, improve global governance, develop partnerships, deepen friendly cooperation, and promote world peace, stability, development and prosperity. , Spain is an ancient European civilization. It is an outstanding place with splendid culture and splendid culture. It has had an important influence on the history of human society. Although China and Spain are far apart, as early as 2000 years ago, the ancient land silk road connected the ancient capital of Chang'an with Spain's Tarragona. Chinese silk and tea came across Spain from Asia and Europe in camel bells. In the Ming Dynasty, the Spanish Ponti I introduced Western astronomy and calendar to China. Gao Muxian translated the Confucian book Mingxin Baojian into Spanish. Cervantes mentioned China many times in his works, and his immortal famous book ""Don Quixote"" is widely circulated in China. History shows that, despite the long distance, Chinese and Western civilizations intersect each other, attract each other, and adhere to the road of exchanges and mutual learning and common development. , In 1973, the People’s Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Spain. In the past 45 years, after undergoing the test of international changes, China and the West have always respected each other, treated each other on an equal footing, and cooperated on a mutually beneficial basis to promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations. -This is 45 years of increasing mutual trust. For 45 years, the two countries have maintained the momentum of high-level exchanges and have always understood and supported each other on major issues involving sovereignty and territorial integrity, laying a solid political foundation for the development of bilateral relations. In the early days of China's reform and opening up in the 1980s and 1990s, the Spanish government extended a hand of friendship to China, and the assistance provided played a positive role in China's development of industrial technology and improvement of facilities and conditions. After the international financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, both China and the West joined hands, cooperated mutually and overcome difficulties. -This is 45 years of close cooperation. Over the past 45 years, the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has been developing smoothly and smoothly, with unprecedented breadth and depth. The bilateral trade volume between China and the West reached 100 million US dollars for the first time in 1979, and exceeded the 30 billion US dollar mark in 2017. Spain has become an indispensable economic and trade cooperation partner of China in Europe. China is also Spain's largest trading partner outside the EU. The Sino-European train connecting Yiwu and Madrid provides more options for the transportation of goods between the two countries and becomes an early harvest of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”. The cooperation between the two sides in the fields of energy, telecommunications, finance, environmental protection, and technological innovation has also been constantly innovated, providing follow-up momentum for pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. , ——This is 45 years of continuous cultural integration. Chinese and Spanish are the two most important languages ​​in the world. Over the past 45 years, cooperation between the two countries in the field of language and culture has flourished. While King Felipe was crown prince, he vigorously promoted the settlement of Cervantes College in Beijing. This year, Spanish was officially included in the standard of Chinese general high school curriculum. More and more Spanish youths are learning Chinese at the Chinese Cultural Center and Confucius Institute in Madrid and experiencing Chinese culture. Lei Linke and other contemporary Spanish Sinologists are constantly writing, and a large number of Spanish workers in China have passed on the beauty of the Spanish language and culture to China. This year is the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up, and the 40th anniversary of Spain's constitutional reform. Strengthening cooperation between China and the West in the new era, resolving the propositions of the times, and seeking common development plans are new responsibilities entrusted to us by history. Through this visit, I would like to have extensive contacts with your country’s leaders and people from all walks of life, jointly inherit Chinese-Western friendship, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and open up a more beautiful and glorious future for China-Western relations. First, we must improve the level of comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries and consolidate the political foundation of bilateral relations. China has always viewed relations with Spain from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is willing to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange visits with the West and strengthen exchanges between the two governments, parliaments, political parties, and localities.Viewing relations with Spain in a long-term and long-term perspective, and willing to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange visits with the West, strengthen exchanges between the governments, parliaments, political parties, and localities of the two countries, always understand and support each other's core interests and major concerns, and firmly grasp the correct relationship between China and Spain direction. Secondly, we must strengthen the exchange of development ideas and strategic integration between the two countries, and do a top-level design of the development of bilateral relations. China always regards Spain as a good partner working hand in hand on the road of development, and is willing to give full play to the complementary advantages of the two countries' economies, make good use of various cooperation mechanisms, and strengthen the joint construction of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative with Spain's ""Asian Development Strategy"" and the Mediterranean Corridor. Build connections, and actively expand third-party market cooperation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results on a larger scale. Third, we must deepen pragmatic cooperation between the two countries and tighten the ties of interest in bilateral relations. China will continue to comprehensively deepen reforms, expand opening up, and implement the five development concepts of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness, and sharing. It is hoped that both sides will continue to maintain an open and inclusive attitude, broaden two-way investment and close trade exchanges. We will host the China International Import Expo every year and are willing to share the opportunities and potential of the Chinese market with countries including Spain. Both sides should give full play to their respective advantages, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in advanced manufacturing, information industry, green economy and other fields, optimize cooperation platforms, innovate cooperation models, and create new growth points for bilateral cooperation. Fourthly, we want to expand cultural exchanges between the two countries and build a strong foundation for public relations in bilateral relations. The connection between the people is the fundamental guarantee for the long-term development of Sino-Western relations. The two sides should continue to expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as culture, education, tourism, sports, and youth, expand aviation links between the two countries, and provide more convenient measures for two-way personnel exchanges. Both China and the West are major cultural heritage countries. Both sides can deepen cooperation in the protection of cultural heritage. China is also willing to strengthen cooperation with Spain in the breeding and breeding of giant pandas, so that giant pandas can become the messengers of the friendship between the two countries from generation to generation. Fifth, we must strengthen international cooperation between the two countries to maintain world peace, stability and prosperity. China is willing to maintain close dialogue and communication with the West within the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G20 and other international multilateral organizations, and strengthen cooperation and coordination on major international and regional issues such as UN Security Council reform, global governance, and climate change, and jointly maintain Multilateralism and free trade are the promoters and defenders of the international order. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Europe. China has always firmly supported European integration and is happy to see a united, stable, open and prosperous Europe. Under the current situation, it is in the common interest of both parties to continue to deepen China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. Spain is an important EU country and a good friend and partner of China in the EU. We hope and believe that Spain will continue to play an active role in the EU and promote the healthy and stable development of China-EU relations. , Spanish thinker Gasset said, ""Ambition with great ambition can make progress, and long-term vision can move forward."" China looks forward to working with Spain to share opportunities, meet challenges together, write a new chapter in Sino-Western relations, and create a better future for the two peoples.

7,28,"[, November 19, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of the Philippines, President Xi Jinping published in the Philippines ""Philippine Star"", ""Manila Bulletin"", ""Daily Tribune"" entitled ""To jointly open up a new future for China-Philippine relations"" Signed articles. The article is as follows: To jointly open up a new future for China-Philippine relations, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of President Duterte of the Republic of the Philippines, I will pay a state visit to the Philippines. The Philippines has beautiful scenery, simple folk customs, and rapid national development. I look forward to this visit. Here, I would like to extend my sincere regards and best wishes to the people of the Philippines! , China and the Philippines face each other across the sea and carry water with their clothes. As early as more than 1,000 years ago, the ""ships and ships have successively joined each other, and the merchants have been affiliated."" More than 600 years ago, Chinese navigator Zheng He made seven voyages and visited the Gulf of Manila and Visaya and Sulu many times to spread friendship and cooperation. King Sulu took the best wishes of the Filipino people to embark on the road of friendship to China, leaving behind the popular stories. Many residents of China's southeast coast traveled across the ocean to the Philippines and lived in harmony with the local people. The ancestor of the Philippine founder and national hero Rizal came from Jinjiang City, Fujian Province, China. Ye Fei, the founder of New China, was born in Quezon, Philippines. They are the common pride of the two peoples. After President Duterte took office, China and the Philippines returned to properly handle the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation. The relationship between the two countries saw a rainbow after the ups and downs. In just over two years, China has become the Philippines’ largest trading partner, the largest export market, the largest source of imports, and the second largest source of tourists. The enthusiasm for private investment between China and the Philippines is increasing, and there are frequent exchanges between cultural groups. More and more Filipino fruits are displayed on the table of Chinese people, and more and more Philippine attractions are included in the itinerary of Chinese tourists. China firmly supports the Philippines’ anti-drug and anti-terrorist efforts, supports the post-war reconstruction of Malawi, and contributes to the maintenance of peace in the Philippines. The people of the two countries watched each other for help in the face of the disaster, and wrote one after another China-Philippine friendship anthem. At present, under the leadership of President Duterte, the Filipino people are promoting the implementation of the ""10-point plan for social and economic development"" and ""large construction and special construction"", which has created a prosperous national development situation. The Chinese people are also making unremitting efforts to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The common expectation and common dream will closely connect the people of China and the Philippines. The main purpose of my visit this time is to exchange in-depth views with President Duterte on enhancing all-round cooperation between China and the Philippines under the new situation, make comprehensive arrangements, and promote greater development of China-Philippine relations at a high level. -Deepening political mutual trust and promoting the stability of Sino-Philippine relations. China is willing to work with the Philippines to plan a blueprint for the development of relations between the two countries with a broader vision and strengthen strategic communication on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues. We must properly handle differences through friendly consultations, strengthen maritime dialogue and cooperation, and make the South China Sea a sea of ​​peace, friendship, and cooperation for the benefit of the people. , ——Insisting on cooperation and seeking truth, ensuring a solid foundation for China-Philippine relations. The geographic location of the Philippines is unique, and it is a natural partner in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. China is willing to work with the Philippines to continue writing a new chapter of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, promote strategic integration within the framework of the “Belt and Road”, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields such as economic and trade, infrastructure construction, agriculture and tourism, and help the Philippines implement more livelihood projects So that the people of the two countries will continue to increase their sense of gain and happiness from their cooperation. China is willing to continue to deepen cooperation in defense, drug control, anti-terrorism, and law enforcement with the Philippines to create a favorable environment for the development of the two countries and regional peace and stability. , ——Insist on the connection between the people and realize the lasting relationship between China and the Philippines. China and the Philippines are geographically close, are close to each other, and have similar cultural links. People's friendly exchanges are the source of the relationship between the two countries. The more the merrier. We must promote exchanges between the political parties, parliaments, localities and think tanks of the two countries, strengthen education, science and technology, culture and youth exchanges, mobilize more forces to participate in the cooperation between the two countries, so that the friendship between China and the Philippines will continue to spread and endless. , ——Insist on working together for a win-win situation, and promote the further development of East Asian cooperation This year marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of a strategic partnership between China and ASEAN. The Philippines successfully held a series of meetings on East Asian cooperation leaders last year, and this year it took over as the coordinator of China-ASEAN relations. It has a glorious mission and great responsibility. China firmly supports the Philippines in fulfilling its responsibilities as a coordinating country, and is willing to join hands with the Philippines to promote the optimization and upgrading of China-ASEAN relations and promote greater development of East Asian cooperation. China will increase its investment in the eastern growth zone of the ASEAN, which is the initiative of the Philippines, further enhance cooperation between the two sides, create new growth points for cooperation with ASEAN, and help the Mindanao and other regions of the Philippines develop better. , 40 years ago, China began reformsEnhance cooperation between the two sides, create new growth points for cooperation with ASEAN, and help the Philippines and Mindanao and other regions develop better. 40 years ago, China began the great process of reform and opening up. Forty years of forging ahead and forging ahead, the Chinese people have written with both hands the magnificent epic of the development of the country and the nation. China has become the world’s second largest economy, the largest industrial country, the largest cargo trading country, and the largest foreign exchange reserve country, contributing more than 30% to global economic growth, and achieving stable poverty alleviation of more than 700 million people under United Nations standards . China is comprehensively deepening reforms and opening up to the outside world. Our reforms will not stop, and opening will not stop. The trend of the times of trade liberalization and economic globalization is irresistible. As a responsible big country, China adheres to the concept of win-win cooperation, and insists on expanding opening up. It is willing to share the opportunities and potential of the Chinese market with other countries. The first successful China International Import Expo just held is the best proof. China welcomes the Philippines and more countries to take the express train developed by China. We will work with other countries to firmly maintain the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization as the core, and promote the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and reasonable direction. Hundreds of years ago, China's GDP had accounted for 30% of the world, but China has never invaded and expanded abroad. For more than 100 years after the Opium War in 1840, China was frequently ravaged by aggression and suffered from war and turmoil. Confucius said: ""Do not do what you don't want, do not impose on others."" The Chinese people believe that only peace and tranquility can develop and prosper. This is not an expedient measure, nor a diplomatic rhetoric, but an organic unity of self-confidence and practical consciousness. We will stick to the path of peaceful development and always be the anchor of peace and stability in the world and the Asia-Pacific region.

8,29,"[, Dear Prime Minister O’Neill, Dear Colleagues,, It’s a pleasure to be here with you all in the beautiful Port Moresby. For the first time, APEC member leaders gathered in the Pacific Island Countries area, focusing on the theme of ""Capturing Inclusive Opportunities and Embracing the Digital Future"" to review the history of cooperation and discuss the Asia-Pacific vision. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Papua New Guinea Government, especially Prime Minister O’Neill for their efforts in preparing for this meeting! In today's world, development and change are surging. New technological revolutions and industrial changes have developed in depth, the global governance system has been profoundly reshaped, and the international landscape has accelerated. At the same time, deep-seated contradictions in global development are prominent, protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise, the multilateral trading system has been hit, and the overall development environment of the world economy is facing many risks and uncertainties. , ""The wise man seeks in time."" Standing at the crossroads of historical progress, we should recognize the general trend of the world, grasp the economic pulse, clarify the future direction, and answer the proposition of the times. First, insist on promoting regional economic integration and building an open Asia-Pacific economy. We should continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. The road to the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area will not be smooth, but we must always move in this general direction and goal. For all kinds of free trade arrangements, we should adhere to the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency, and promote coordination with each other to achieve benign interaction. We should firmly maintain the rules-based multilateral trading system and clearly resist protectionism. The World Trade Organization is exploring a new round of reform. The purpose of the reform should be to make it work better and adhere to the core values ​​and basic principles of the multilateral trading system, rather than reinvent the wheel. We should guide economic globalization to develop in a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win direction. This year is the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up. China will unswervingly deepen reforms comprehensively, accelerate the improvement of the socialist market economic system, and build a modern economic system. China will adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world, substantially relax market access, increase the protection of intellectual property rights, and create a more attractive investment and business environment. A week ago, the first China International Import Expo was successfully held in Shanghai, attracting 172 countries, regions and international organizations, more than 3,600 enterprises participated in the exhibition, more than 400,000 domestic and foreign buyers attended the meeting to negotiate purchases, and the turnover reached 57.8 billion US dollars. More than 4500 celebrities from all walks of life attended the Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum. This shows once again that China’s determination to support free and open trade and to actively open the market to the world will not be shaken. Second, adhere to the innovation drive and cultivate new growth momentum. The digital economy is the future development direction of Asia-Pacific and even the world. We should firmly grasp the trend of the era of innovation and development, fully implement the ""Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap"", and unlock the growth potential of the digital economy. At the same time, we should strengthen digital infrastructure and capacity building, increase the accessibility of the digital economy, bridge the digital divide, allow members at different stages of development to share the achievements of the digital economy, and let the people of the Asia-Pacific region catch the digital economy. , China is vigorously building a ""Digital China"" and has harvested a number of innovations in the fields of ""Internet +"" and artificial intelligence. New technologies, new business models and new models such as sharing economy, online retail, and mobile payment are constantly emerging, which has profoundly changed the lives of Chinese people. China is willing to deepen digital economic cooperation with all parties in the Asia-Pacific region, cultivate more points of interest and economic growth, and inject strong new momentum into the Asia-Pacific economy. Thirdly, insist on improving the interconnected network to promote inclusive and joint development. Interconnection is the basis for inclusive and joint development. We should thoroughly implement the blueprint for interconnection and interconnection, so that Unicom's network can cover every corner of the Pacific coast. We should take the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as the guide and take more pragmatic measures to make development more balanced, more sustainable growth, more equal opportunities, and more inclusive society. , China attaches great importance to the construction of interconnection. After five years of hard work, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is entering a new stage of in-depth development. In April next year, China will host the second ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum. China will work with other countries to insist on mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, high-quality, high-standard, and high-level construction of the “Belt and Road”, creating greater development opportunities for people in the Asia-Pacific and the world. , Fourth, insist on deepening partnership and work together to meet common challenges. APEC has gone through nearly 30 years of cooperation, and the partnership of mutual trust, tolerance, cooperation and win-win has become our common wealth. The national conditions of Asia-Pacific countries vary greatly, and it is not surprising that there are differences. The key is to adhere to the common development of this convention, carry forward the spirit of partnership, negotiate differences, and explore and solve common challenges. We should base ourselvesNot surprisingly. The key is to adhere to the common development of this convention, carry forward the spirit of partnership, negotiate differences, and explore and solve common challenges. We should base ourselves on the reality of diversity, respect each other's choice of development path, blend and learn from each other on an open and inclusive basis, cooperate with each other while benign competition, and jointly build a community of shared destiny in Asia and the Pacific. , China adheres to the people-centered development concept and practices the new development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing. Over the past few decades, more than 700 million people in China have been lifted out of poverty, and they will alleviate poverty by 2020. The contribution rate of the Chinese economy to world economic growth has been maintained at over 30%. At the same time, it is accelerating from rapid growth to high-quality development. This year, consumption has contributed 78% to China's economic growth. The overall momentum of China’s long-term economic stability will continue. , Colleagues! As leaders of the Asia-Pacific region, we have a responsibility to ascend our horizons and plan the cooperation vision of APEC after 2020. We should follow the trend of economic globalization and not be blocked by temporary difficulties, continue to uphold the purpose of promoting regional economic integration, grasp the general direction of building an open world economy, and strive to maintain the momentum of Asia-Pacific cooperation and steadily move to a higher level. , China is an active advocate and firm practitioner of Asia-Pacific cooperation. China's development is inseparable from close cooperation with all parties in the Asia-Pacific region, and it also expands vast space for Asia-Pacific development. China will deeply participate in the Asia-Pacific cooperation process, increase investment, deepen practical cooperation with all parties, and make new contributions to the development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Port Moresby, November 18th), ""People's Daily"" (November 19, 2018, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Seize the opportunity of the times and seek prosperity in the Asia-Pacific,2004,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-11-19,"[, 尊敬的奥尼尔总理，, 各位同事：, 很高兴同大家相聚在美丽的莫尔兹比港。亚太经合组织成员领导人首次在太平洋岛国地区聚首，围绕“把握包容性机遇，拥抱数字化未来”的主题，回顾合作历程，共商亚太愿景。我谨对巴布亚新几内亚政府特别是奥尼尔总理为筹备本次会议付出的努力，表示衷心的感谢！, 当今世界，发展和变革风起云涌。新科技革命和产业变革深入发展，全球治理体系深刻重塑，国际格局加速演变。同时，全球发展深层次矛盾突出，保护主义、单边主义思潮抬头，多边贸易体制受到冲击，世界经济整体发展环境面临诸多风险和不确定性。, “智者顺时而谋。”站在历史前进的十字路口，我们应该认清世界大势，把握经济脉动，明确未来方向，解答时代命题。, 第一，坚持推进区域经济一体化，构建开放型亚太经济。我们应该持续推进贸易和投资自由化便利化。通往亚太自由贸易区的路途不会平坦，但我们要始终朝着这个大方向、大目标迈进。对各类自由贸易安排，我们应该坚持开放、包容、透明原则，促进彼此协调，实现良性互动。我们应坚定维护以规则为基础的多边贸易体制，旗帜鲜明抵制保护主义。世界贸易组织正在探讨新一轮改革，改革的目的应该是让其更好发挥作用，坚持多边贸易体制的核心价值和基本原则，而不是推倒重来。我们应该引导经济全球化朝着更加开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的方向发展。, 今年是中国改革开放40周年。中国将坚定不移全面深化改革，加快完善社会主义市场经济体制，建设现代化经济体系。中国将坚持对外开放基本国策，大幅度放宽市场准入，加大保护知识产权力度，创造更具吸引力的投资和营商环境。一周前，首届中国国际进口博览会在上海成功举行，吸引了172个国家、地区和国际组织，3600多家企业参展，40多万名境内外采购商到会洽谈采购，成交额达到578亿美元。4500多名各界知名人士出席虹桥国际经贸论坛。这再次表明，中国支持自由开放贸易、主动向世界开放市场的决心不会有任何动摇。, 第二，坚持创新驱动，培育增长新动能。数字经济是亚太乃至全球未来的发展方向。我们应该牢牢把握创新发展时代潮流，全面平衡落实《互联网和数字经济路线图》，释放数字经济增长潜能。同时，我们应该加强数字基础设施和能力建设，增强数字经济可及性，消弭数字鸿沟，让处于不同发展阶段的成员共享数字经济发展成果，让亚太地区人民搭上数字经济发展快车。, 中国正在大力建设“数字中国”，在“互联网+”、人工智能等领域收获一批创新成果。分享经济、网络零售、移动支付等新技术新业态新模式不断涌现，深刻改变了中国老百姓生活。中国愿同亚太各方深化数字经济合作，培育更多利益契合点和经济增长点，为亚太经济注入强大新动能。, 第三，坚持完善互联互通网络，促进包容联动发展。互联互通是实现包容联动发展的基础。我们应该深入落实互联互通蓝图，让联通的网络覆盖太平洋沿岸的每一个角落。我们应该以2030年可持续发展议程为引领，采取更多务实举措，让发展更加均衡、增长更可持续、机会更加平等、社会更加包容。, 中国高度重视互联互通建设。经过5年努力，共建“一带一路”正进入深入发展新阶段。明年4月，中国将主办第二届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛。中国将同各国一道，坚持共商共建共享，高质量、高标准、高水平建设“一带一路”，为亚太和世界各国人民创造更大发展机遇。, 第四，坚持深化伙伴关系，携手应对共同挑战。亚太经合组织走过近30年合作历程，互信、包容、合作、共赢的伙伴关系已经成为我们的共同财富。亚太各国国情千差万别，有分歧并不奇怪。关键是要坚持共谋发展这个公约数，发扬伙伴精神，协商处理分歧，探索解决共同挑战。我们应该立足多样性实际，尊重彼此选择的发展道路，在开放包容的基础上交融互鉴，在良性竞争的同时互利合作，共同构建亚太命运共同体。, 中国坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，践行创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的新发展理念。过去几十年，中国7亿多人口摆脱贫困，将在2020年实现全面脱贫。中国经济对世界经济增长的贡献率一直保持在30%以上。同时正在加快从高速增长转向高质量发展。今年，消费对中国经济增长的贡献达到78%。中国经济长期稳定向好的总体势头会继续保持下去。, 各位同事！, 作为亚太地区领导人，我们有责任登高望远，规划好亚太经合组织2020年后的合作愿景。我们应该顺应经济全球化发展大势，不为一时的困难所阻挡，继续秉持推动区域经济一体化宗旨，把握构建开放型世界经济大方向，努力保持亚太合作势头，稳步迈向更高水平。, 中国是亚太合作的积极倡导者和坚定践行者。中国的发展离不开同亚太各方的紧密合作，也为亚太发展拓展了广阔空间。中国将深入参与亚太合作进程，加大投入，同各方深化务实合作，为亚太地区发展繁荣作出新贡献！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社莫尔兹比港11月18日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2018年11月19日 02 版）, ]",习近平：把握时代机遇 共谋亚太繁荣,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30407251
9,30,"[, November 17, on the eve of a state visit to Brunei Darussalam, State President Xi Jinping published in Brunei's ""Borneo Bulletin"", ""Shihua Daily"", ""Lianhe Daily"" and ""Sin Chew Daily"" A signed article entitled ""Working Together to Write the Xinhua Chapter of China-Brunei Relations"". The article is as follows:, Working together to write the Xinhua chapter of China-Brunei relations, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, at the invitation of His Majesty Sultan Hassanal, I will pay a state visit to Brunei from November 18 to 20. This is my first visit to your country, and I am very happy about this trip. , The name of the country of Brunei means ""a state of peace"". There are beautiful natural scenery, rich urban style, and peaceful social atmosphere here, just like the paradise described by the ancient Chinese poet Tao Yuanming. In recent years, under the excellent leadership of His Majesty the Sultan, Brunei has embarked on a development path that suits its national conditions. The country is prosperous and prosperous, and the people live and work in peace and contentment. I sincerely wish Brunei greater achievements in development. , China and China are friendly neighbors across the sea. Brunei has been an important part of the Maritime Silk Road since ancient times. As early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, our ancestors communicated with each other through this maritime bond, and wrote a beautiful chapter of knowing each other and meeting each other. Zheng He led the fleet through Brunei twice, bringing peace and friendship to the local people, and was kindly called ""Marshal Zheng He"" by the Brunei people. The ""Zhongbingbing Road"" and the Tomb of Dandelion in Sri Baga Bay City, and the Tomb of King Mu Ni in Nanjing, China, have witnessed the long history of friendly exchanges between the two countries. , In 1991, China formally established diplomatic relations with Brunei, and the ""leading edge"" of the two countries for thousands of years was renewed. Over the past five years since the two sides established a strategic cooperative relationship, mutual political trust has continued to deepen, pragmatic cooperation has steadily advanced, and they have supported and cooperated with each other in international and regional affairs. The Chinese relationship has entered the best period in history and has become a model for countries of all sizes to treat each other as equals, for mutual benefit and win-win progress and common development. The initiative to co-construct the “Belt and Road” initiative received positive response and strong support from Brunei. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to promote the integration of this initiative with Brunei’s “Vision 2035” and inject new impetus into the development of bilateral relations. This year, the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has expanded rapidly. China has become one of Brunei's most important partners. The two flagship cooperation projects of Hengyi Brunei Petrochemical and the ""Guangxi-Brunei Economic Corridor"" have proceeded smoothly. The increasing number of Chinese companies investing in Brunei's business has played an active role in Brunei's economic diversification. Chinese companies have actively participated in the construction of Brunei’s infrastructure, and have undertaken projects such as the Great Mora Island Bridge, the Trice-Rumu Expressway, and the Uludu East Dam, which has raised the level of Brunei’s interconnectivity and has become a beautiful place in Brunei. ""Chinese business card"". , Humanities exchanges between the two countries are becoming more frequent. China is Brunei’s largest source of tourists, and Chinese tourists can be seen on the streets of Sri Baga Bay from time to time. The two countries have opened direct air routes from Sri Baga Bay City to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanning, and Kunming, which has established an air corridor for personnel exchanges. As the friendship cities of Nanjing and Sri Baga Bay frequently move around, the friendship between the people of the two countries has shown new vitality. This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up, and the 5th anniversary of the proposal to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative. China will insist on opening up to the outside world and promote the “Belt and Road” to go deeper and better, so as to better benefit the people along the route. At present, China and Brunei are in the critical period of achieving the ""two hundred years"" struggle goals and the realization of the ""2035 vision"". Both parties should deepen understanding, enhance friendship, deepen cooperation, and promote the development of Chinese relations. , ——We want to enhance mutual political trust. Both sides should plan for the development of Chinese relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, maintain high-level exchanges, increase political mutual trust, and push bilateral relations to a new level. China respects and firmly supports Brunei's development path in line with its national conditions. , ——We must deepen pragmatic cooperation. The two sides should strengthen strategic integration, and China is willing to continue to provide assistance to Brunei to achieve economic diversification, build key cooperation projects, and explore cooperation in the fields of energy, infrastructure, agriculture and fisheries, e-commerce, and offshore. China will encourage Chinese companies to invest in Brunei and welcome Brunei to expand the export of high-quality products to China. , ——We want to deepen cultural exchanges. Both sides should expand exchanges and cooperation in culture, health, education, sports, tourism, human resources training and other fields. We support the airline companies of the two countries to open more direct flights, encourage more Chinese tourists to visit Brunei, and welcome more Brunei friends to study, travel and work in China. -We must strengthen coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs. China is willing to work with Brunei to promote the in-depth development of China-ASEAN cooperation in various fields, accelerate the process of negotiating regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements, and promote ChinaTogether. China is willing to work with the Brunei side to promote the in-depth development of China-ASEAN cooperation in various fields, accelerate the negotiation process of the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement, promote the achievement of the China-ASEAN free trade zone upgrade as soon as possible, and support the Brunei side to play a greater role in the ASEAN growth zone effect. China is willing to join hands with the Liberal side to safeguard multilateralism, the international trading system, and the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and contribute to regional peace, stability, and prosperity. , Brunei has a proverb: ""Without mutual understanding, it is not possible to build a deep friendship."" The Chinese said: ""The acquaintances of people, know each other."" We are willing to be a good friend and a good partner for common development with Brunei . I believe that with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations in Chinese will surely write a better chapter!

In recent years, relations between the two countries have entered a new stage of rapid development. PNG is China's largest trading partner in the Pacific Island Countries, and China has become the largest source of foreign investment and the largest project contractor in PNG. China’s aided Independence Avenue and International Conference Center will play an important role in hosting the APEC leaders’ informal meeting; the Chinese medical team will provide humanitarian medical services to the people of Papua New Guinea for 16 years; use Chinese government preferential loans The constructed hydropower stations, hospitals, and school buildings have become new landmarks throughout Papua New Guinea; Chinese companies have actively responded to the ""2030 Development Strategy"" proposed by the Papua New Guinea government and participated in the construction of highways, bridges, airports, and docks throughout Papua New Guinea. 18 years ago, during my tenure as governor of Fujian Province in China, I had promoted the implementation of a demonstration project on the cultivation of fungus and upland rice by the Fujian Province to assist the Papua New Zealand. I am happy to learn that this project has continued to operate so far and has played a very good economic and social benefit, which has become a good story for the development of China-Papua New Guinea relations. , I look forward to working with Papua New Guinea through this visit to increase mutual trust, expand pragmatic cooperation, expand cultural exchanges, and push China-Papua New Guinea relations to a new level. The rapid development of China-Pakistan-New Zealand relations is the epitome of the overall development of China’s relations with Pacific island countries. Four years ago, I held a collective meeting with the leaders of the eight Pacific island countries that established diplomatic relations in Nadi, Fiji. All parties unanimously agreed to establish a strategic partnership of mutual respect and common development. The relationship between China and the island countries has entered a new historical period and rejuvenated. Vitality. In promoting the development of bilateral relations, China and island countries adhere to the following principles. , ——Insist on mutual respect. China and the island nation regard each other as sincere friends and friendly partners. China insists on equality between large and small countries, firmly supports the people of island countries in taking a development path that suits their national conditions, and supports island countries in playing their due role in international affairs. The island nation has long given China valuable support on issues involving China's core interests and major concerns. , ——Insist on deepening cooperation. China's economic and trade exchanges with island countries are becoming closer, economic and technological cooperation is deepening, and the cake of common interests is constantly growing. Special commodities such as LNG from Papua New Guinea, mineral water from Fiji, pumpkins from Tonga and tuna from the Federated States of Micronesia have successfully entered the Chinese market. China provides support and assistance to the development and construction of island countries within its capacity, and has contributed to the promotion of the economic development of island countries and the well-being of the people. , ——Insist on the common people. The average number of Chinese tourists to islands exceeds 100,000 annually. A large number of young students, government officials, and technicians from island countries came to China to study, study, and study. The cultural and art troupes of both sides exchange and exchange visits frequently. The Chinese Navy’s “Peace Ark” hospital ship visited Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu and provided humanitarian diagnosis and treatment services to more than 20,000 island people. ""We don't know each other far and wide, and thousands of miles are still neighbors."" Facts have proved that the vast Pacific Ocean is the link between China and the island countries. Looking at the whole world, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are developing in depth. How to seize opportunities, overcome difficulties and accelerate development is a common historical task for China and island countries, and a common good for both peoples.With the in-depth development of industry reform, how to seize opportunities, overcome difficulties and accelerate development is a common historical task for China and island countries, and a common wish of both peoples. During this visit to Papua New Guinea, I once again invited the leaders of the eight Pacific island countries that established diplomatic relations to gather in Papua New Guinea to discuss friendship, discuss development plans, and let China and the island nations set sail again. First, strategic mutual trust must reach a new level. China will stand firmly with developing countries including Pacific island countries. The Chinese side will uphold the true and sincere concept and the correct concept of justice and benefit to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Pacific island countries, support the development of island countries, and promote the reduction of the North-South development gap. China is willing to work with island nations to promote the construction of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. Second, common development must add new impetus. China is willing to expand pragmatic cooperation with island countries in trade and investment, and welcomes Pacific island countries to actively participate in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” in accordance with their own conditions and advantages, combined with their own development strategies and plans. It is believed that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” will provide a new path for China to strengthen economic and trade ties and interconnections between island countries, various island countries, and other countries in the world, and to better participate in the process of economic globalization. Thirdly, the people's friendship must write a new chapter. The island state has a proverb: ""Friendship is a canal in the desert."" We are willing to continue to expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of culture, education, health, sports, youth, locality, human resources training and other fields with the island country, and welcome more friends from Pacific island countries to China for sightseeing 1. Studying abroad, investing in business, investigating and visiting, deepening mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two sides, and spreading the friendship between the two sides. During my visit to Papua New Guinea, I will also attend the 26th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. This is the first time that Papua New Guinea and Pacific island countries host an informal meeting of APEC leaders. It can be said that it is a grand event for the entire island country. I look forward to working with all members to focus on the theme of ""Capturing Inclusive Opportunities and Embracing the Digital Future"", and to conduct in-depth exchanges on important topics such as regional economic integration, digital economy, interconnection, sustainability, and inclusive growth. Make new contributions to stability and development. At present, the development of relations between China and Pacific island countries is at the best period in history and is facing important development opportunities. China is willing to work with Pacific island countries to ride the wind and waves and set sail towards a better tomorrow for the relationship between the two sides! , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 14th), ""People's Daily"" (November 15, 2018, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in Papua New Guinea media,2261,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-11-15,"[, 11月14日，在对巴布亚新几内亚独立国进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在巴布亚新几内亚《信使邮报》、《国民报》发表题为《让中国同太平洋岛国关系扬帆再启航》的署名文章。文章如下：, 让中国同太平洋岛国关系扬帆再启航, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 我即将对著名的“天堂鸟之国”巴布亚新几内亚进行国事访问，并出席在巴新举行的亚太经合组织第二十六次领导人非正式会议。这将是我首次到访巴新，也是中国国家主席首次对巴新进行国事访问。我对此充满期待。, 巴新是面积最大、人口最多的太平洋岛国，自然资源丰富，发展潜力巨大，是一片充满希望的热土。近年来，在奥尼尔总理领导下，巴新政府和人民积极进取、奋发图强，国家发展欣欣向荣，社会面貌焕然一新。我衷心祝愿巴新在国家建设和经济社会发展的道路上不断取得新的更大成就，预祝巴新这次主办亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议获得圆满成功。, 中国同巴新友好交往源远流长。早在100多年前就有华人漂洋过海来到这里，扎根当地、辛勤劳动，为巴新经济社会发展作出了重要贡献。1976年两国建交以来，双方坚持相互尊重、平等相待、互利共赢，中国同巴新关系经受住了国际风云变幻考验，历久弥新。, 近年来，两国关系进入了快速发展的新阶段。巴新是中国在太平洋岛国地区第一大贸易伙伴，中国成为巴新第一大外资来源地和第一大工程承包方。中国援建的独立大道、国际会议中心将为巴新主办这次亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议发挥重要作用；中国医疗队16年如一日为巴新民众提供人道主义医疗服务；使用中国政府优惠贷款建设的水电站、医院、校舍成为巴新各地的新地标；中国公司积极响应巴新政府提出的“2030发展战略”，在巴新全国参与建设公路、桥梁、机场、码头。, 18年前，我担任中国福建省省长期间，曾推动实施福建省援助巴新东高地省菌草、旱稻种植技术示范项目。我高兴地得知，这一项目持续运作至今，发挥了很好的经济社会效益，成为中国同巴新关系发展的一段佳话。, 我期待着通过这次访问，同巴新方一道努力，增进相互信任，拓展务实合作，扩大人文交流，推动中国同巴新关系再上新台阶。, 中国同巴新关系的迅速发展，是中国同太平洋岛国整体关系发展的缩影。4年前，我在斐济楠迪同8个建交太平洋岛国领导人举行集体会晤，各方一致同意建立相互尊重、共同发展的战略伙伴关系，中国同岛国关系进入了新的历史时期，焕发出新的勃勃生机。中国和岛国在推动双边关系发展实践中，坚持了以下原则。, ——坚持相互尊重。中国和岛国视彼此为真诚朋友和友好伙伴。中方坚持大小国家一律平等，坚定支持岛国人民走符合自身国情的发展道路，支持岛国在国际事务中发挥应有作用。岛国在涉及中国核心利益和重大关切问题上长期给予中方宝贵支持。, ——坚持深化合作。中国同岛国经贸交往日益密切，经济技术合作更加深入，共同利益的蛋糕不断做大。巴新的液化天然气、斐济的矿泉水、汤加的南瓜、密克罗尼西亚联邦的金枪鱼等特色商品已经成功进入中国市场。中国在力所能及范围内为岛国发展建设提供支持和援助，为促进岛国经济发展、增进人民福祉作出了贡献。, ——坚持民心相通。中国赴岛国游客年均超过10万人次。大量岛国青年学生、政府官员、技术人员到中国学习深造、考察研修。双方文艺团组交流互访频繁。中国海军“和平方舟”医院船访问巴新、斐济、汤加、瓦努阿图，为2万多名岛国民众提供了人道主义诊疗服务。, “相知无远近，万里尚为邻。”事实证明，浩瀚的太平洋是中国同岛国关系发展的纽带。放眼全球，新一轮科技革命和产业变革深入发展，如何把握机遇、共克时艰、加快发展，是中国和岛国共同的历史任务，也是双方人民共同的美好心愿。这次访问巴新期间，我再次邀请8个建交太平洋岛国领导人在巴新相聚，共叙友好情谊，共商发展大计，让中国同岛国关系扬帆再启航。, 第一，战略互信要再上新台阶。中国将同包括太平洋岛国在内的广大发展中国家坚定站在一起。中方将秉持真实亲诚理念和正确义利观加强同太平洋岛国的团结合作，支持岛国发展，促进缩小南北发展差距。中国愿和岛国共同推动构建新型国际关系，推动构建人类命运共同体。, 第二，共同发展要再添新动力。中方愿扩大同岛国在贸易和投资等领域务实合作，欢迎太平洋岛国根据自身条件和优势，结合本国发展战略和规划积极参与共建“一带一路”。相信共建“一带一路”将为中国同岛国、各个岛国之间以及岛国同世界其他国家加强经贸联系和互联互通、更好参与经济全球化进程提供新的路径。, 第三，人民友谊要再谱新篇章。岛国有句谚语：“友谊是沙漠中的水渠。”我们愿同岛国不断扩大文化、教育、卫生、体育、青年、地方、人力资源培训等领域交流合作，欢迎更多太平洋岛国朋友到中国旅游观光、留学深造、投资经商、考察访问，加深双方人民相互了解和友谊，让双方友好事业薪火相传。, 我这次访问巴新期间还将出席亚太经合组织第二十六次领导人非正式会议。这是巴新也是太平洋岛国首次主办亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议，可以说是整个岛国地区的一件盛事。我期待着同各成员一道，聚焦“把握包容性机遇，拥抱数字化未来”主题，就区域经济一体化、数字经济、互联互通、可持续和包容增长等重要议题进行深入交流，为本地区和平、稳定、发展作出新贡献。, 当前，中国同太平洋岛国关系发展正处于历史最好时期，面临重要发展机遇。中国愿同太平洋岛国一道努力，乘风破浪，向着双方关系更加美好的明天扬帆再启航！, （新华社北京11月14日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2018年11月15日 01 版）, ]",习近平在巴布亚新几内亚媒体发表署名文章 ,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30401403
11,32,"[, Dear President Putin, Dear colleagues from various countries, Ladies, gentlemen, friends:, I am very happy to visit Vladivostok again after an interval of 8 years. First of all, I would like to sincerely thank President Putin for his kind invitation and thoughtful arrangement of Russian friends. At the initiative of President Putin, the Oriental Economic Forum has been successfully held for three sessions, becoming an important platform for all parties to gather wisdom and discuss cooperation. This year's Oriental Economic Forum was full of guests and unprecedented. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend warm congratulations to President Putin and Russian friends! , ""Eastern winds are springing."" Yesterday, when I got off the plane, I was attracted by the new look of Vladivostok. The rippling Golden Horn Bay is connected, and the Russian Island Bridge is flying north and south, making us feel the rapid development of Vladivostok. The development achievements made by Vladivostok are the epitome of the rapid development of the Russian Far East in recent years. Just like the theme of this year's Oriental Economic Forum-""Far East: More Opportunities"", the Far East region has shown vigorous development vitality, providing new opportunities for all parties to come here to invest in business and carry out cooperation. , China has always been an active supporter and participant of Russian Far East cooperation. China and Russia are each other's largest neighbors and have unique geographical advantages for cooperation. China and Russia are each other's comprehensive strategic cooperation partners. The relationship between the two countries is at its best in history and the political foundation for cooperation is solid. China implements a coordinated regional development strategy and accelerates the pace of revitalization of old industrial bases such as the Northeast. Russia has incorporated Far East development into its national development strategy, and the cooperation policy is guaranteed to be strong. The two countries established the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee of Northeast China and the Russian Far East and Baikal Region, formed the Industrial Council of Northeast China and the Russian Far East and Baikal Region, and held a dialogue between Chinese and Russian local leaders. The cooperation mechanism is complete and efficient. With the joint efforts of both sides, in recent years, China's participation in Russian Far East cooperation has achieved remarkable results. In 2017, China's trade with the Russian Far East Federal District exceeded US$7.7 billion. China has participated in more than 30 projects in the Far East Leapfrog Development Zone and Freeport, with a planned investment of over US$4 billion. China has become the largest trading partner and the largest source of foreign investment in the Russian Far East. China has set up the first phase of China-Russia regional cooperation and development investment fund of 10 billion yuan and a total scale of 100 billion yuan. It is willing to work with Russia to support the operation of the fund, promote the implementation of major projects, and build it into an important platform for China-Russia regional cooperation. . With the smooth progress of a number of major projects such as the Sino-Russian crude oil pipeline, the East Line natural gas pipeline, the Tongjiang Railway Bridge, and the Heihe Highway Bridge, Sino-Russian Far East cooperation will usher in a bumper harvest season. This year and next year will be the year of Sino-Russian local cooperation and exchange determined by President Putin and me, and will open up a wider space for cooperation between the Far East of the two sides. China is willing to work with Russia to expand cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure construction, energy, agriculture, and tourism, widely mobilize the enthusiasm of small and medium-sized enterprises, and strive to increase the technical content and added value of cooperation between the two sides, achieve complementary advantages, mutual benefit and win-win, promote China More cooperation has been achieved in the Russian Far East. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! Under the new situation, we must work together and strengthen cooperation to promote peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region. I would like to share some views with you. , We must increase mutual trust and maintain regional peace and tranquility. At present, the international situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, and power politics, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. The population of the six countries of Northeast Asia accounts for 23% of the global population, and the GDP accounts for 19% of the global economy. A harmonious, mutual trust, unity, and stable Northeast Asia is in line with the interests of all countries and the expectations of the international community. It is also of great significance for maintaining multilateralism and promoting the development of international order in a more just and reasonable direction. As a member of Northeast Asia, China has always upheld the concept of peaceful development and strived to create a harmonious and friendly surrounding environment; always participated in regional cooperation in a constructive attitude in the spirit of mutual respect; always focused on considering and caring for the concerns of all parties and committed to Promote exchanges and dialogue among countries in the region. China is willing to continue to work with all parties to continuously consolidate unity, increase mutual trust, and jointly explore effective ways to maintain lasting and peaceful Northeast Asia, and make unremitting efforts to achieve peace, stability and development in the region. , We must deepen cooperation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win situation for all countries. Northeast Asia is rich in energy resources, has world-leading scientific and technological research and development capabilities, and has sufficient capital and human resources. Each country has its own advantages in economic development, with distinctive characteristics and strong complementarities. At present, the regional situation is stable and improving, and the countries in the region are fully capable and capable of giving full play to their respective advantages and carry out in-depth cooperation in various fields. , We must actively carry out development strategy docking. According to the consensus I reached with President Putin, China and RussiaGive full play to their respective advantages and carry out in-depth cooperation in various fields. , We must actively carry out development strategy docking. According to the consensus I reached with President Putin, China and Russia are actively carrying out the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" and the docking of the Eurasian Economic Union, which has achieved important early gains. China is willing to connect development strategies with all parties on this basis, strengthen policy communication and coordination, form synergy, and grasp the general direction of cooperation. We must focus on improving the level of cross-border infrastructure interconnection, trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, promoting the market, capital, and technology flow of countries, optimizing resource allocation and industrial structure, jointly building an open regional economy, and striving to build a Northeast Asian economic circle. We must vigorously promote small multilateral cooperation and subregional cooperation. Trilateral cooperation between China, Japan, South Korea, China, Russia and Mongolia has achieved good results. China is open to multilateral cooperation that is conducive to regional stability, development, and win-win cooperation. China is willing to study in depth the possibility of other multilateral and subregional cooperation with all parties, and promote the implementation of more tangible projects. The people bring more benefits. In this regard, China supports the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund to play a greater role in providing project funding guarantees. , We must learn from each other and consolidate the traditional friendship of the people. The countries in Northeast Asia are geographically close, culturally integrated, and people's hearts shared. People of all countries have forged profound friendships during long-term exchanges, and many moving stories have emerged. The Vladivostok “Ocean” All-Russian Children’s Center has received more than 900 children from the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area in Sichuan, China. The Chinese children have been cared for by meticulous care here and have formed a deep love with Russia. One of the children named Xi Junfei made a wish, hoping to grow up and study in Russia. The drift bottle with his wish was returned to the staff of the ""Ocean"" Children's Center after a few months of drifting in the sea. Now his wish comes true, studying at the Federal University of the Far East. This story is a vivid example of friendly exchanges among people in the region. In the future, countries can broaden communication channels and innovate forms of cooperation on the existing basis, consolidate and deepen cooperation in traditional fields such as tourism, youth, education, and cultural industries, and strengthen mutual cooperation in the areas of cultural heritage, co-creation, and intellectual property protection. Learn from each other and strive to create convenience and build a platform for people from all countries and all ages to communicate. , We must focus on the long-term and achieve comprehensive and coordinated development. Countries in Northeast Asia have different development models and levels, rapid economic growth, and many cooperation projects. They need to be based on reality, focus on the long-term, strengthen overall coordination, and achieve coordinated and sustainable development of economy and society, resources and environment, and people and nature. , China is willing to work with countries in the region to actively explore the establishment of a new model for coordinated development in Northeast Asia, accelerate technological innovation, change development concepts, increase comprehensive environmental governance, and form an industrial pattern and lifestyle that conserves resources and protects the environment. Facing regional environmental problems. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , China is willing to continue to work with countries in the region to seize historical opportunities, follow the trend of the times, strengthen cooperation in the Russian Far East and Northeast Asia, promote the realization of regional diversification and sustainable development, and continue to make the common interest cake bigger so that people in the region Share cooperation opportunities and development achievements, and work together to create a better tomorrow in the Far East and Northeast Asia! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Vladivostok, September 12th), ""People's Daily"" (September 13, 2018, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Sharing the New Opportunities for the Development of the Far East and Creating a Beautiful New Future in Northeast Asia,2547,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-09-13,"[, 尊敬的普京总统，, 尊敬的各国同事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 很高兴时隔8年再次到访符拉迪沃斯托克。首先，我要衷心感谢普京总统的盛情邀请和俄方朋友的周到安排。, 在普京总统亲自倡议下，东方经济论坛已经成功举办3届，成为各方凝聚智慧、共商合作的重要平台。本届东方经济论坛宾朋满座，盛况空前。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向普京总统和俄方朋友表示热烈的祝贺！, “东方风来满眼春。”昨天一下飞机，我就被符拉迪沃斯托克的崭新面貌吸引。碧波荡漾的金角湾舳舻相接，俄罗斯岛大桥飞架南北，让我们感受到符拉迪沃斯托克快速发展的景象。, 符拉迪沃斯托克取得的发展成就，是近年来俄罗斯远东地区快速发展的缩影。正如本届东方经济论坛的主题——“远东：更多机遇”，远东地区展现出勃勃发展生机，为各方来这里投资兴业、开展合作提供了新契机。, 中国一直是俄罗斯远东合作的积极支持者和参与者。中俄互为最大邻国，合作地缘优势独特。中俄互为全面战略协作伙伴，两国关系处于历史最好时期，合作政治基础牢固。中国实施区域协调发展战略，加快东北等老工业基地振兴步伐，俄罗斯将远东发展纳入国家发展战略，合作政策保障有力。两国成立中国东北地区和俄罗斯远东及贝加尔地区政府间合作委员会，组建中国东北地区和俄罗斯远东及贝加尔地区实业理事会，举行中俄地方领导人对话会，合作机制完备高效。, 在双方共同努力下，近年来，中方参与俄罗斯远东合作成果显著。2017年，中国同俄罗斯远东联邦区贸易额超过77亿美元。中方参与远东跨越式发展区和自由港项目30余个，规划投资超过40亿美元。中国已经成为俄罗斯远东地区第一大贸易伙伴国和第一大外资来源国。中方已设立首期100亿元、总规模1000亿元人民币的中俄地区合作发展投资基金，愿同俄方一道支持运营好基金，推进重大项目落地，将其打造成为中俄地区合作的重要平台。随着中俄原油管道、东线天然气管道、同江铁路桥、黑河公路桥等一批大项目顺利推进，中俄远东合作将迎来丰收季。, 今明两年是我和普京总统确定的中俄地方合作交流年，为双方远东合作开辟了更加广阔的空间。中方愿同俄方一道努力，拓展基础设施建设、能源、农业、旅游等重点领域合作，广泛调动中小企业积极性，努力提高双方合作技术含量和产品附加值，实现优势互补，互利共赢，推动中俄远东合作取得更多成果。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 新形势下，我们要携手并肩、加强合作，共同促进本地区和平稳定和发展繁荣。我愿提几点看法同大家交流。, 我们要增进互信，维护地区和平安宁。当前，国际形势深刻复杂变化，强权政治、单边主义、保护主义抬头。东北亚地区六国人口占全球人口23%，国内生产总值占全球经济总量19%。一个和睦、互信、团结、稳定的东北亚符合各国利益和国际社会期待，对维护多边主义、推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展也具有重要意义。, 作为东北亚地区一员，中方始终秉持和平发展理念，努力营造和睦友好的周边环境；始终本着相互尊重的精神，以建设性姿态参与地区合作；始终注重考虑和照顾各方关切，致力于推动地区各国交流对话。中方愿继续同各方一道，不断巩固团结，增进互信，共同探索维护东北亚持久和平安宁的有效途径，为实现本地区和平、稳定、发展不懈努力。, 我们要深化合作，实现各国互利共赢。东北亚地区能源资源丰富，具有世界领先的科技研发能力，资金和人力资源充足，各国经济发展各具优势，特点鲜明，互补性强。当前，地区形势稳定向好，地区国家完全有能力、有条件充分发挥各自优势，开展各领域、深层次合作。, 我们要积极开展发展战略对接。根据我同普京总统达成的共识，中俄正在积极开展“一带一路”建设和欧亚经济联盟对接，已经取得重要早期收获。中方愿在这一基础上同各方对接发展战略，加强政策沟通和协调，形成合力，把握合作大方向。我们要重点提升跨境基础设施互联互通、贸易和投资自由化便利化水平，促进各国市场、资本、技术流动，优化资源配置和产业结构，共同建设开放型区域经济，努力构建东北亚经济圈。我们要大力推动小多边合作、次区域合作。中日韩、中俄蒙等三方合作都已取得良好成效。中方对有利于促进地区稳定、发展、共赢的多边合作均持开放态度，愿同各方深入研究开展其他多边和次区域合作的可能性，推动更多实实在在的项目落地实施，给地区人民带来更多实惠。在这方面，中方支持亚洲基础设施投资银行、丝路基金发挥更大作用，提供项目资金保障。, 我们要互学互鉴，巩固人民传统友谊。东北亚各国地缘相近，文化相融，民心相通，各国人民在长期交往中结下深厚友谊，涌现了许多感人故事。符拉迪沃斯托克“海洋”全俄儿童中心曾经接待900多名中国四川汶川地震灾区儿童疗养，中国孩子们在这里受到无微不至的关怀，同俄罗斯结下深厚情缘。其中一名叫席浚斐的儿童许下心愿，希望长大后来俄罗斯读书。装有他心愿的漂流瓶在大海漂流几个月后回到“海洋”儿童中心工作人员手中。现在他的愿望成真，在远东联邦大学就读。这个故事是本地区人民友好往来的生动例证。, 未来，各国可以在现有基础上，拓宽交流渠道，创新合作形式，巩固和深化旅游、青年、教育、文化产业等传统领域合作，同时在文化遗产、共同创作、知识产权保护等领域加强互学互鉴，努力为各国、各年龄段民众开展交流创造便利，打造平台。, 我们要着眼长远，实现综合协调发展。东北亚地区各国发展模式和水平不尽相同，经济增速快，合作项目多，更需要立足现实，着眼长远，加强统筹协调，实现经济和社会、资源和环境、人与自然协调可持续发展。, 中方愿同地区各国一道，积极探讨建立东北亚地区协调发展新模式，加快科技创新，转变发展理念，加大环境综合治理力度，形成节约资源和保护环境的产业格局和生活方式，携手应对共同面临的区域性环境问题。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中方愿继续同地区国家一道，抓住历史机遇，顺应时代潮流，加强在俄罗斯远东及东北亚地区合作，推动实现本地区多元化、可持续发展，不断做大共同利益蛋糕，使本地区人民共享合作机遇和发展成果，携手开创远东和东北亚更加美好的明天！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社符拉迪沃斯托克9月12日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2018年09月13日 02 版）, ]",习近平：共享远东发展新机遇 开创东北亚美好新未来,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30289798
12,33,"[, Dear President Ramaphosa, Dear President Sale, Dear journalist friends, Ladies and gentlemen: Good afternoon! Nice to meet you all. , First of all, I am happy to announce that the 2018 China-Africa Cooperation Forum Beijing Summit has just concluded successfully! In the past two days, the leaders of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum members gathered in Beijing to review the implementation of the results of the 2015 Forum Johannesburg Summit and plan for China-Africa, focusing on the theme of ""win-win cooperation and building a closer community of shared destiny between China and Africa."" The future development of the relationship draws a grand blueprint for China-Africa cooperation. The meeting issued the ""Beijing Declaration on Building a Closer Community of Destiny for China and Africa"", which embodies the consensus of China and Africa on current major international and regional issues, and sends a strong signal to the world that China and Africa go hand in hand. The meeting adopted the ""China-Africa Cooperation Forum-Beijing Action Plan"", which determined that China and Africa will focus on implementing the ""Eight Actions"" in the next three years and comprehensively strengthen practical cooperation in various fields. We all agree that the world today is undergoing a major change that has not been seen in a century. The world is multi-polarized and economic globalization is developing in depth. The destiny of peoples of all countries has never been as closely connected as it is today. At the same time, the instability and uncertainty faced by the world is outstanding, and mankind faces many common challenges. We are willing to join hands to jointly create a community of shared destiny between China and Africa with shared responsibility, win-win cooperation, shared happiness, cultural prosperity, safety and harmony, and better safeguard the common interests of China and Africa, and strengthen the strength of developing countries. Let the world we live in become more balanced and beautiful, and set an example for the times to promote the building of a community of human destiny. We agree that China-Africa relations have withstood the test of time and international changes, and have embarked on a road of distinctive win-win cooperation, which is at the best period in history. China and Africa are willing to strengthen strategic coordination and policy coordination, promote China-Africa cooperation in building the “Belt and Road”, and build the “Belt and Road” with the African Union’s 2063 Agenda, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries Close connection, focusing on the implementation of the ""eight actions"" of industry promotion, facilities connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, health and hygiene, cultural exchanges, peace and security, provide more opportunities for China-Africa cooperation and add stronger momentum.

China and Africa will unswervingly strengthen unity and cooperation and move forward together on the road of win-win cooperation and common development. China will continue to uphold the true concept of sincerity and the correct concept of justice and benefit, and work with Africa to draw strength from the profound foundation of China-Africa friendship and mutual trust, grasp the direction in the vigorous momentum of pragmatic cooperation between China and Africa, and promote China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership. Going deep and going forward We all agree that the realization of development and revitalization is Africa’s due right, which requires the efforts of African countries and people and the support of the international community. China-Africa cooperation is a part of international cooperation with Africa. China-Africa cooperation has always adhered to mutual benefit and win-win results and openness and tolerance. We hope that international partners can learn from each other, give play to their respective advantages, form synergy, and jointly contribute to peace and development in Africa.

After five years of separation, the BRICS leaders' meeting once again entered Africa, and it is a matter of celebration. , The theme of this meeting is ""Brics in Africa: Conspiracy, Inclusive Growth and Common Prosperity in the Fourth Industrial Revolution"", which is of practical significance. From the mechanization of the first industrial revolution in the 18th century, to the electrification of the second industrial revolution in the 19th century, and to the informatization of the third industrial revolution in the 20th century, subversive technological innovations brought great liberation of social productivity The great leap in living standards has fundamentally changed the trajectory of human history. Nowadays, we are experiencing a larger and deeper technological revolution and industrial transformation. Big data, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies have continuously made breakthroughs, and new technologies, new formats, and new industries are emerging in an endless stream. The interests and destinies of various countries are closely linked and deeply integrated. At the same time, the conversion of new and old kinetic energy in the world economy has not yet been completed, and deep-seated and structural problems such as the imbalance between north and south have not been eliminated. Geopolitical conflicts are emerging one after another, and protectionism and unilateralism are intensifying, which directly affects the external environment for the development of emerging market countries and developing countries. , The tide of the times is running endlessly, and no one's will is transferred. The BRICS countries must grasp the historical trend, deepen strategic partnerships, consolidate the ""three-wheel drive"" cooperation structure, and make the vision of the second ""Golden Decade"" a reality, and work together towards the community of human destiny. , First, unleash the enormous potential of economic cooperation. Strengthening economic cooperation and achieving common development is the original intention and main line of BRICS cooperation, and it is also an area with the greatest potential, the richest content, and the most concentrated results. We must strengthen cooperation in trade, investment, finance, interconnection and other fields and make the cooperation cake bigger and more substantial. Within the framework of the United Nations, the G20, and the World Trade Organization, we must firmly maintain the rule-based multilateral trading system, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and clearly oppose protectionism. , We must persist in innovation and lead by building new industrial revolution partnerships, strengthening macroeconomic policy coordination, achieving in-depth integration of development strategies, and accelerating the transformation of old and new kinetic energy and the transformation and upgrading of economic structure through mutual efforts.

Second, firmly maintain international peace and security. Political and security cooperation is an important part of the BRICS strategic partnership. We will continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism, safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and urge all parties to abide by the basic norms of international law and international relations, resolve disputes through dialogue, and negotiate differences. It is necessary to give full play to the mechanisms of foreign ministers’ meetings, meetings of high-level representatives of security affairs, and meetings of permanent representatives to the United Nations, make a BRICS voice, propose BRICS plans, and jointly build new international relations of mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. , Third, deepen the humanities exchanges and cooperation.

China has achieved common development and prosperity. We must expand ""BRICS+"" cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and the G20, expand the common interests and development space of emerging market countries and developing countries, promote the establishment of broad partnerships, and make greater contributions to world peace and development. , Colleagues!

14,35,"[, Dear colleagues: Qingdao in June, picturesque. At this beautiful time, everyone is welcome to attend the eighteenth meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. As early as 2500 years ago, Confucius, a great thinker in ancient China, said, ""A friend comes from afar, is it fun?"" Today, Shandong, the hometown of Confucius, welcomes guests from all over the world. We are here to discuss Shanghai cooperation Organizational development plan has special significance. In five days, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will celebrate its 17th birthday. In retrospect, the organization has gone through an extraordinary development process and achieved significant achievements. For 17 years, we have followed the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to build constructive partnerships that are non-aligned, non-confrontational, and do not target third parties. This is a major innovation in the theory and practice of international relations, creating a new model of regional cooperation and making new contributions to regional peace and development. Today, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is the world’s most comprehensive and most comprehensive regional cooperation organization. The member countries’ economies and populations account for about 20% and 40% of the world’s total, respectively. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has 4 observer countries, 6 dialogue partners, and has established extensive cooperative relations with the United Nations and other international and regional organizations. The international influence has continuously increased, and it has become an indispensable part of promoting world peace and development and maintaining international fairness and justice. Important power. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has always maintained a strong vitality and a strong momentum for cooperation. The fundamental reason is that it creatively proposes and always practices the ""Shanghai Spirit"", advocating mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and seeking common development. This transcends outdated concepts such as conflicts of civilizations, cold war thinking, and zero-sum games. It has opened a new page in the history of international relations and has been increasingly recognized by the international community. , Colleagues! , ""Confucius ascended the East Mountain and Xiaolu, climbed the Taishan Mountain and small world"". In the face of the new situation of major developments, major changes and adjustments in the world, in order to better advance the cause of human civilization and progress, we must ascend our horizons and correctly understand and grasp the general trend of the world and the trend of the times. Although hegemonism and power politics still exist in the world today, the call to promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction cannot be ignored, and the democratization of international relations has become an irresistible trend of the times. Despite the continuous emergence of various traditional and non-traditional security threats, the forces that defend peace will eventually defeat the forces that disrupt peace, and security and stability are what people want. Although the trend of unilateralism, trade protectionism, and anti-globalization is constantly showing new manifestations, the world of ""global villages"" determines the increasing integration of interests, destiny and common interests of all countries, and a win-win cooperation is the general trend. Although the clashes of civilization conflicts and superior civilizations have emerged from time to time, the diversity of civilizations is an inexhaustible driving force for human progress. Exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations are the common aspirations of people of all countries. , Colleagues! At present, the development of the world is full of hope and challenges. Our future is extremely bright, but the road ahead will not be smooth. We must further promote the ""Shanghai Spirit"", solve the problems of the times, and resolve the risks and challenges. ——We must promote the innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development concept, achieve coordinated economic and social progress of all countries, solve the problems caused by uneven development, narrow the development gap, and promote common prosperity. ——We must practice a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, abandon the Cold War mentality, group confrontation, and oppose sacrificing the security of other countries in exchange for our absolute security to achieve universal security. ——We must uphold an open, harmonious, mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation concept, reject selfish self-interest, short-sighted and closed narrow policies, maintain the rules of the World Trade Organization, support the multilateral trading system, and build an open world economy. ——We must establish a civilization concept of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and tolerance, use civilization exchange to transcend civilization barriers, use civilization mutual learning to transcend civilization conflicts, and civilization coexistence transcend civilization superiority. ——We must adhere to the global governance concept of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, constantly reform and improve the global governance system, and promote countries to work together to build a community of shared future for humanity. , Colleagues! The ""Shanghai Spirit"" is our common wealth, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is our common home. Under the guidance of the ""Shanghai Spirit"", we must continue to work together, cooperate sincerely, work together to build a community of shared destiny in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, promote the construction of a new type of international relations, and work together towards a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, tolerance, cleanness and beauty . To this end, I would like to make the following suggestions. , First, gather together a strong force of unity and mutual trust. We want to fully implement the Qingdao Declaration and the implementation outline of the long-term good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treatyWilling to make the following suggestions. , First, gather together a strong force of unity and mutual trust. We must fully implement the Qingdao Declaration and the implementation outline of the long-term good-neighborly friendship and cooperation treaty, respect each other’s chosen development path, take into account each other’s core interests and major concerns, enhance mutual understanding through empathy, promote harmony and unity through seeking common ground while reserving differences, and continuously strengthen the organization’s Cohesion and centripetal force. Second, build a common foundation for peace and security. We must actively implement the cooperation outline for combating the ""three forces"" from 2019 to 2021, continue to hold ""peace missions"" and other joint anti-terrorism exercises, and strengthen cooperation in defense security, law enforcement security, and information security. The role of ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization-Afghanistan Liaison Group"" should be played to promote the process of peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan. In the next three years, China is willing to use the China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization International Judicial Exchange and Cooperation Training Base and other platforms to train 2,000 law enforcement personnel for all parties and strengthen law enforcement capacity building. Third, build a powerful engine for common development and prosperity. We must promote the integration of development strategies, promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” in accordance with the principle of mutual consultation and joint construction, accelerate the process of regional trade facilitation, and step up the implementation of international road transport facilitation agreements and other cooperation documents. China welcomes all parties to actively participate in the first China International Import Expo to be held in Shanghai this November. The Chinese government supports the establishment of a China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization local economic and trade cooperation demonstration zone in Qingdao, and will also establish a ""China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization Legal Service Committee"" to provide legal support for economic and trade cooperation. , I announced that China will set up a RMB 30 billion equivalent special loan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Banking Consortium. , Fourth, tighten the common bond of cultural exchanges and cooperation. We must actively implement documents such as the environmental protection cooperation concept of member countries, continue to carry out brand projects such as youth exchange camps, and solidly promote cooperation in various fields such as education, science and technology, culture, tourism, health, disaster reduction, and media. In the next three years, China will provide 3,000 human resources development training places for member countries to enhance the public's understanding and recognition of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization family. China is willing to provide meteorological services to all parties using the Fengyun 2 meteorological satellite. Fifth, jointly expand the network of partners for international cooperation. We must strengthen exchanges and cooperation with observer countries, dialogue partners and other regional countries, close partnerships with international and regional organizations such as the United Nations, and carry out dialogues with international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to promote the resolution of hot issues and improve the global Governance contributes. , Colleagues! Over the past year, with the strong support and help of various member states, China has completed the work of the presidency and held this summit.

15,105,"[, Dear President Ramaphosa, Dear Togolese President Faure, Dear Vice President Mabuza, Ministers, Dear friends of industry and commerce, Ladies and gentlemen, friends: PM it is good! It's great to be here again in the ""Rainbow Country"" and to be with you in the scenic Johannesburg. Five years ago, the first international summit I attended after taking over as China’s president was the fifth meeting of BRICS leaders in Durban. Three years ago, at this conference center, I attended the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with African leaders. After nearly 3 years, I set foot on the African continent again. I deeply feel the vigorous development and prosperity of the African continent. In September 2017, with the strong support of all parties, China successfully hosted the meeting of the BRICS leaders Xiamen. The leaders of the five countries unanimously decided to deepen the strategic partnership, consolidate the ""three-wheel drive"" cooperation framework of economic and trade finance, political security, and cultural exchanges, establish the ""BRICS+"" cooperation concept, and jointly create the second ""golden decade"" of BRICS cooperation. "". , I heard that Johannesburg is called ""Golden City"" in Nguni language. In the ""Golden City"" sketching the beauty of the ""Golden Decade"" blueprint, it would be more appropriate! I look forward to working with leaders to promote the BRICS cooperation from Johannesburg, embark on a new journey and complete a new mission! , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The birth and development of the BRICS mechanism is the product of changes in the world economy and the evolution of the international landscape. In the first 10 years, the BRICS cooperation took off, with bright spots. The five countries uphold the BRICS spirit of openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation. They have promoted the deepening of pragmatic cooperation in various fields, deepened solidarity and mutual trust, enhanced the well-being of the people of the five countries, tightened the interests and emotional bonds, and stabilized the recovery of the world economy and returned to growth. Road has made outstanding contributions. Now the world is facing a major change that has not been seen in a century. For the vast number of emerging market countries and developing countries, this world is full of opportunities and challenges. We must plan for BRICS cooperation in the historical process of the evolution of the international landscape, seek our own development in the historical process of world development and the common development of BRICS countries, and achieve new leaps in the ""Golden Decade"". ——The next 10 years will be the key to the transformation of the old and new kinetic energy of the world economy. Artificial intelligence, big data, quantum information, biotechnology and other new rounds of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are gathering strength, spawning a large number of new industries, new formats, and new models, bringing earth-shaking changes to global development and human production and life. We must seize this major opportunity to promote the leapfrog development of emerging market countries and developing countries. -——The next 10 years will be a decade of accelerated evolution of the international pattern and strength comparison. The contribution rate of emerging market countries and developing countries to world economic growth has reached 80%. Calculated by the exchange rate method, the total economic volume of these countries accounts for nearly 40% of the world. Keeping the current development speed, it will be close to half of the world total in 10 years. The emergence of emerging markets and developing countries in an unreasonable manner will make the global development landscape more comprehensive and balanced, and make the foundation of world peace more solid and stable. ——The next 10 years will be a decade of profound reshaping of the global governance system. The world's multi-polarization and economic globalization are moving forward through twists and turns, geopolitical hot spots are emerging one after another, and the haze of terrorism and armed conflict is lingering. Unilateralism and protectionism are intensifying, and multilateralism and the multilateral trading system have been seriously affected. To cooperate or to oppose each other, to open or to close, or to seek mutual benefit or win-win situation, the international community has once again come to a crossroads of where to go. The direction of the global governance system is related to the development space of countries, especially emerging market countries and developing countries, and to the prosperity and stability of the world. The BRICS countries should follow the historical trend, seize the development opportunities, work together to overcome the challenges, and play a constructive role in building a new type of international relations and a community of shared future for mankind. First, adhere to win-win cooperation and build an open economy. Open cooperation is the inevitable logic of scientific and technological progress and the development of productive forces. A trade war is not desirable because there will be no winners. Economic hegemony is even more important, because it will damage the common interests of the international community, and eventually it will lift its feet on the feet. At a time when the world economy is undergoing profound adjustments and changes, only openness can benefit different countries, mutual prosperity, and lasting development. This is the wise choice countries should make. The BRICS countries must resolutely build an open world economy, clearly oppose unilateralism and protectionism, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and jointly guide economic globalization towards a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win direction. . To letPromote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and jointly guide economic globalization towards a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win situation. We must let more of the positive effects of economic globalization be released and help emerging market countries and developing countries, especially African countries and LDCs, to participate effectively in the international industrial division of labor and share the dividends of economic globalization. , Second, adhere to innovation and lead, seize development opportunities. Science and technology are the primary productive forces and provide endless impetus for the progress of human civilization. Mankind has experienced several leaps in agricultural civilization and industrial civilization, which has brought about great development of social productive forces, and it has also been accompanied by the pains of transformation. Today, the world once again comes to such an important historical node. In the new tide of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, removing old fabrics will inevitably lead to industrial transformation. This process is difficult and painful. Successfully leapfrogging transformation, countries will gain new vitality and vitality, bring better lives and more well-being to the people. In the face of the new opportunities brought about by new technology, every country has equal rights to development. When the trend comes, if you can't keep up, you will fall behind and be eliminated. What we can and should do is to seize the opportunity, increase investment in innovation, focus on cultivating new economic growth points, and realize the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. It is necessary to push forward structural reforms with all efforts, remove all institutional and institutional obstacles that are not conducive to innovation, and fully stimulate innovation potential and market vitality. It is necessary to establish a global perspective, deepen international innovation exchanges and cooperation, give play to their respective comparative advantages and resource endowments, and let technological progress benefit more countries and people. At the same time, we must properly resolve the impact of informatization, automation, and intelligence on traditional industries, and create new employment opportunities in the process of cultivating new industries. Thirdly, insist on inclusiveness and benefit for the benefit of people of all countries. The problems of uneven development and inadequate development are common challenges facing all countries. On the one hand, the North-South gap between emerging market countries and developing countries and developed countries is still very obvious. On the other hand, within each country, there are development gaps to varying degrees. , The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a comprehensive action plan for the international community. Based on their own national conditions, the BRICS countries should deeply integrate the 2030 agenda with their own development strategies, insist on taking the people as the center, coordinate economic, social and environmental development, and continuously enhance the people's sense of gain and happiness. We must uphold the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, promote the international community to fully implement the Paris Agreement, and accelerate the construction of an ecological system that respects nature and green development. We must actively promote international development cooperation, urge developed countries to honor their official development assistance commitments, and increase support for developing countries. Africa is the continent with the most concentration of developing countries and the region with the most development potential in the world. We must strengthen cooperation with Africa, support Africa's development, and strive to make the BRICS-Africa cooperation a model for South-South cooperation. In specific cooperation, we should actively cooperate with African countries in poverty reduction, food security, innovation, infrastructure construction, industrialization and other fields in accordance with their own reality, help countries' economic structural development, and provide assistance for the implementation of the AU's 2063 Agenda. Let the ancient African land show vigorous vitality. Fourth, adhere to multilateralism and improve global governance. A good and stable external environment is an important prerequisite for the development of all countries, especially for emerging market countries and developing countries. The current international order is not perfect, but as long as it is based on rules, fairness-oriented, and win-win as the goal, it cannot be abandoned at will, and it cannot be tolerated. The BRICS countries should firmly adhere to multilateralism and urge all parties to earnestly abide by the jointly formulated international rules, insist that all countries, big and small, are equal, discuss their affairs, and oppose hegemonism and power politics. It is necessary to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, and actively participate in good offices to resolve geopolitical hotspot issues. We must firmly support the multilateral trading system, continue to advance global economic governance reform, and increase the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. Regardless of issues such as innovation, trade and investment, intellectual property protection, or Xinjiang, cyberspace, outer space, and polar regions, when formulating new rules, we must fully listen to the opinions of emerging market countries and developing countries, reflect their interests and demands, and ensure that Their room for development. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! This year is the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up. Difficulties and hardships, Yuru Yucheng. Over the past 40 years, China has gone through an extraordinary course and successfully opened the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Based on the national conditions and looking at the world, the Chinese people not only draw wisdom from the long Chinese civilization, but also draw on the strengths of East and West countries, and continue to move towards the world and integrate into the world. While achieving their own development, they have made for the noble cause of human peace and development. Important contribution. As the largest developing country in the world, we will firmly grasp the pulse of the development of the times and deeply implement innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and shared development.offer. As the largest developing country in the world, we will firmly grasp the pulse of the development of the times, deeply implement the concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness, and shared development, accelerate the promotion of innovation-driven development strategies, deeply participate in international innovation and technical cooperation, and actively develop South Africa. South Africa will strive to create greater opportunities for the common development of emerging market countries and developing countries. , We will continue to open the door for construction. At the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Meeting held in April this year, I announced a series of new measures to expand opening up, and these measures are being implemented quickly. We will continue to create a more attractive investment environment, strengthen the connection with international rules, increase transparency, adhere to the law, encourage competition, and oppose monopoly. We will strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights, increase law enforcement, increase the cost of illegality, encourage normal technological exchanges and cooperation between enterprises, and protect the legitimate intellectual property rights of all enterprises. We will take the initiative to expand imports and promote the current account balance. In November this year, China will host the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai. This is a major measure by which China firmly supports trade liberalization and actively opens the market to the world, and will build a new platform for all parties to enter the Chinese market. At present, more than 2,800 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have confirmed to participate in the Expo, and it is estimated that more than 150,000 domestic and foreign buyers will attend the fair. Friends from the BRICS and African countries are welcome to attend the conference and join in the grand event. , We will continue to vigorously promote the construction of the ""Belt and Road"", and open up new space for the economic and social development of various countries and the implementation of the 2030 agenda. The ""One Belt One Road"" initiative is based on the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, which originated in China and belongs to the world. We sincerely hope that BRICS countries, African countries, emerging market countries and developing countries will join the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” partnership network, so that the achievement of the “Belt and Road” will benefit more countries and people. China is a natural good friend, good brother and good partner of African countries. China-Africa cooperation is a model of South-South cooperation. In September this year, China will jointly host the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with African countries. The theme of this summit will be ""win-win cooperation, build a closer community of shared destiny between China and Africa"", with the focus on integrating China and Africa's ""Belt and Road Initiative"", the 2030 Agenda, and the ""2063 Agenda"" with the development strategies of African countries. To achieve a win-win and common development of China-Africa cooperation at a higher quality and a higher level. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Economic cooperation is the most important and most productive area of ​​BRICS cooperation. With the joint efforts of all parties this year, BRICS economic cooperation has taken new steps. We will work together to build a new industrial revolution partnership in the BRICS countries, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, promote innovation and industrialization cooperation, and jointly accelerate the transformation of new and old kinetic energy and the transformation and upgrading of the economy. The five countries have also deepened cooperation in trade facilitation, service trade, e-commerce, and intellectual property, and have achieved positive results. These measures are conducive to seizing opportunities and coping with challenges in today's changing world, and are also conducive to implementing the BRICS economic partnership strategy. The industrial and commercial sector is the main force and new force of BRICS economic cooperation. In the process of initiating the second ""Golden Decade"", the business community has a lot to do. I hope that all entrepreneurs and friends will give full play to their respective advantages, promote mutual benefit and win-win results for the five countries, and achieve common development. I hope you will be brave in reform and innovation, dare to try first, and make a world for the development of the five countries, the common development of emerging market countries and developing countries. I hope that you will closely integrate the actual needs of the people, pursue both economic benefits and social benefits, and build a foundation for the BRICS public opinion. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , This year is the 100th anniversary of Mr. Mandela’s birth. He has a famous saying: ""After climbing a high mountain, you will find that there are more high mountains waiting for you to climb."" The journey of BRICS cooperation is precisely the process of the five countries joining hands to climb the peak and continually surpass. As long as the BRICS countries work together, they can continue to climb dangerous peaks and cliffs, reach new peaks and reach new heights, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development! , thank you all.

16,106,"[, Dear Highness Sabah Emir, Dear President of Al-Afghani, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Jubail, Dear Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Mr. Ghat, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen , Friends:, good morning everyone! , 　　 4 years ago, I sent an invitation to the Arab world to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative. Today, we are here again with our longing for a better future of China-Arab cooperation. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I sincerely welcome the guests! Congratulations on the 8th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab Cooperation Forum! , 　　China-Arab friendship has a long history and lasts forever. Although the two major ethnic groups are far apart, they are like a family. On the ancient Silk Road, we “have a boat to the road, and a ambassador to a merchant”. We have fought side by side in the struggle for national independence and people’s liberation. We have supported each other and cooperated mutually in the construction of our respective countries. We have written a win-win cooperation Splendid chapter. History and practice have proved that no matter how the international situation changes, no matter what difficulties and obstacles we face, China and Afghanistan have always been good partners of mutual benefit and brothers who share the same difficulties. , 　　 In order to promote the common prosperity and progress of all countries, China proposes to jointly build the “Belt and Road”, adhering to the principle of consultation and joint construction and sharing, and promoting policy communication, facility connectivity, trade smoothness, capital and financial links, and people’s hearts, and gained the international community, including the Arab world. Broad support and active participation. As one of the important participants and creators of the Silk Road civilization in history, Arab countries are located at the intersection of the “Belt and Road” and are natural partners in jointly building the “Belt and Road”. , 　　 China published a white paper on Arab countries' policies, and the ""Belt and Road"" has become an important part of China-Arab relations. The Council of Foreign Ministers of the League of Arab States passed a resolution expressing the political will of Arab countries to collectively participate in the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. At this ministerial meeting, China and Afghanistan will also sign the ""Declaration of Action on the Belt and Road Initiative for China-Arab Cooperation"". , 　　 In the past 4 years, we have worked hand in hand to integrate the “Belt and Road” with the actual situation in the region, combine collective action with bilateral cooperation, combine the promotion of development with the maintenance of peace, complement each other's strengths, cooperate and win-win, and benefit the people of the region and the world. . The location of the “Belt and Road” construction presents a colorful and vigorous appearance, bearing fruitful results. In the past four years, the construction of the “Belt and Road” has comprehensively driven the development of China-Arab relations, and the all-round cooperation between China and Arabs has entered a new stage. Here, I announce that after friendly consultations between China and Arab countries, we have unanimously agreed to establish a comprehensive partnership, common development, and future-oriented Sino-Arab strategic partnership. This is a new historical starting point for China-Arab friendly cooperation. , 　　 China is willing to strengthen its strategy and action docking with Afghanistan, work together to promote the construction of the “Belt and Road”, and jointly act as a defender of peace and stability in the Middle East, a defender of fairness and justice, a promoter of common development, and a good friend who learns from and learns from each other. Build a community of shared destiny between China and Afghanistan and contribute to the building of a community of shared destiny between mankind and China. , 　　 First, enhance strategic mutual trust. ""A trip on the road, the world is the public."" At present, the Middle East is facing the urgent task of eliminating the peace and solving the difficulties of development. China's Middle East policy is in line with the strong desire of the Middle East people to pursue peace and look forward to development. Reasonably appeal for endorsement, willing to play a greater role in promoting regional peace and stability. , 　　We must persist in dialogue and consultation. Many things in the Middle East are intertwined. Everyone has to discuss it. It is impossible for one family to make the final decision. We must adhere to the principle of sovereignty and oppose separatism. We must advocate inclusive reconciliation and oppose repressive compromises. We must oppose terrorism, strengthen comprehensive measures, and do a good job in building people's livelihood.　　 China is willing to conduct more dialogues and consultations with Algeria on a wide range of topics including development for peace, collective security, humanitarian relief, navigation by sea lanes, and nuclear-weapon-free zones. Here, I announce that China has set up a “Special Plan for Promoting Economic Reconstruction with Industrial Rejuvenation” to provide a loan of US$20 billion, strengthen cooperation with countries that need reconstruction, and promote projects with wide employment and good benefits in accordance with the principles of commercialization . China will provide another 600 million yuan in aid to the people of Syria, Yemen, Jordan and Lebanon for local humanitarian and reconstruction efforts. China will also discuss the implementation of a project with a total value of 1 billion yuan with countries in the region to support the stability-building capabilities of relevant countries. , 　　 Second, realize the dream of revival. The Arab world has superior location conditions and outstanding energy endowments. China and Arab countries complement each other's strengths and interests, and we must link up each other's development strategies so that the dreams of the revival of the two nations are closely linked. ,The endowment is outstanding. China and Arab countries complement each other's strengths and interests, and we must link up each other's development strategies so that the dreams of the revival of the two nations are closely linked. , 　　 must firmly grasp the ""faucet"" of interconnection. China is willing to participate in the construction of ports and future Arab railway networks in Arab countries, and supports the construction of a golden hub logistics network connecting Central Asia and East Africa and connecting the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. We will work together to create a blue economic channel, build a marine cooperation center, promote the development of the marine industry, and enhance the capacity of marine public services. It is necessary to jointly build the “Belt and Road” space information corridor, develop aerospace cooperation, and promote the construction of China’s Beidou navigation system and meteorological remote sensing satellite technology to serve Arab countries. , 　　 should actively promote the “double-wheel” rotation of oil and gas cooperation and low-carbon energy cooperation. We must continue to promote the ""oil and gas +"" cooperation model, deepen the cooperation of the entire industrial chain of oil and gas exploration, exploitation, refining, storage and transportation. We must comply with the global energy revolution, the vigorous development of green and low-carbon industries, and strengthen the peaceful use of nuclear energy, solar energy, Cooperation in the fields of wind energy, hydropower, etc., jointly build a Sino-Arab energy cooperation pattern of oil and gas traction, nuclear energy follow-up, and clean energy acceleration, and create a mutually beneficial and long-term friendly Sino-Arab energy strategic cooperation relationship. , 　　 should strive to achieve the ""two wings"" of financial cooperation and high-tech cooperation. We need to study how to give full play to the driving role of high technology and the support of financial cooperation, to provide short-term cooperation and long-term support for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, and to explore financial and technological cooperation models that suit the needs of the Middle East and reflect the characteristics of the Middle East. , 　　 China supports the establishment of a production capacity cooperation financial platform, expands diversified investment and financing channels around the construction of industrial parks, and promotes the development of park services, enterprise growth, and financial support. China supports relevant Chinese financial and securities institutions to cooperate with Arab sovereign wealth funds and management institutions to establish an international trading platform based on the Gulf, radiating the Middle East and North Africa, and absorbing global investors, striving to achieve free flow of factors, efficient allocation of resources, in-depth market integration, and services Construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. In order to promote financial exchanges and cooperation, China will set up a ""China-Arab Banking Consortium"" with a $3 billion special loan for financial cooperation.　　 China is willing to strengthen the cooperation between the two sides in the digital economy, artificial intelligence, new materials, biopharmaceuticals, smart cities and other fields in conjunction with the Arab countries’ medium- and long-term development strategic planning. We must implement the China-Arab Science and Technology Partnership Program and build joint laboratories in key areas of interest to both parties. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of the online Silk Road, and strive to reach more cooperation consensus and achievements in the fields of network infrastructure, big data, cloud computing, and e-commerce. , 　　 Third, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. China will insist on comprehensively deepening reforms, adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world, and persist in opening the country to engage in construction. In the next five years, China will import more than US$8 trillion in commodities and its total foreign investment will exceed US$750 billion, which will bring more cooperation opportunities and real benefits to Arab countries. We will continue to make good use of special loans and preferential loans to support the industrialization of the Middle East, promote Chinese enterprises to participate in the development and construction of the park, attract investment, and promote industrial gathering. China welcomes Arab countries to participate in the first China International Import Expo held in Shanghai in November this year. It will achieve full coverage of Arab countries’ participation in the Expo and comprehensive trade and investment exhibitions in the next five years. China is willing to pragmatically advance negotiations with the Gulf Arab States Cooperation Committee and the Palestine Free Trade Area, and is also willing to explore the possibility of signing a comprehensive free trade agreement with more Arab countries. , 　　 Fourth, promote tolerance and mutual learning. The vitality of civilization lies in communication and interaction. In history, the Chinese civilization and the Arab civilization have mingled with each other. Today, we want to learn more wisdom and nutrition from each other. The China-Arab Reform and Development Research Center, which I propose to establish, has worked well and has become an ideological platform for the two sides to exchange experiences in reform, opening up, and governance. In the future, the center will be bigger and stronger to provide more intellectual support for both sides. , 　　 We need to spread the idea of ​​peace, harmony and truth-seeking, and hold a round table meeting on dialogue between China and Arab civilizations and depolarization. We need to eliminate misunderstandings through dialogue, resolve differences with tolerance, and create a good atmosphere for doing things right. We need to dig deeper into the content of different religions to promote harmony, health and upwards, and do a good job of teaching interpretation in light of the progress of the times. We must work together to build an online civilization, and jointly oppose the use of extreme and hate speech on the Internet. , 　　 In order to promote the emotional and spiritual communication between the Chinese and Arab peoples, China will invite 100 young innovation leaders, 200 young scientists, and 300 scientific and technical personnel from the Arab countries to come to China for discussion in the next three years, and then invite 100 religious people, 600 Leaders of famous political parties visited China, provided Arab countries with 10,000 various training places, and dispatched 500 medical members to Arab countries. ,   I'm hereThe party leader visited China, provided Arab countries with 10,000 various training places, and dispatched 500 medical members to the Arab countries. , 　　 I hereby announce that the China-Arab News Exchange Center was officially established, the China-Arab Electronic Library Portal Project was officially launched, and the fourth ""Arab Art Festival"" jointly held by China and Arabs in China was officially launched. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Both China and Afghanistan are important political forces on the international stage, and China-Arab cooperation should continue to develop in the tide of world development and progress, and keep advancing in the pace of human history. Peace, reform and development are the common needs of all countries in the Middle East. Stability, tranquility and happiness are the common pursuit of the people of the Middle East. All parties must accurately grasp the historical trend, sincerely respond to the voice of the people, and together push the Middle East region to embark on a new path of comprehensive revitalization. , 　　 The diversity of the Middle East should become the source of regional vitality. It is necessary to respect the differences in national conditions and independent choices of each country, insist on treating each other as equals, and seek common ground while reserving differences. Foreign forces should do more to persuade and promote talks, and provide positive energy for the peaceful development of the Middle East. It is necessary to abandon the idea of ​​exclusive security and absolute security, not to make you lose or win, and to respect only yourself, to create a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security architecture. , 　　 development is the key to solving many governance problems in the Middle East. The potential for development must be released through reform, and the driving force for progress should be enhanced through opening up. All parties must always be mindful of cooperation, do more win-win additions and multiplications, gather together development efforts, complement each other, and share prosperity.　　The Arab nation is an ancient, tenacious, and wise nation. It has created a splendid civilization with the spirit of not being afraid of challenges and chasing the trend of the times. As long as the Arab countries are united, any difficulties and risks will not stop you. , 　　 The question of Palestine is the root cause of peace in the Middle East. The Chinese people have always been full of justice and compassion. We call on all parties concerned to abide by the international consensus and deal fairly with the relevant Palestinian issues, and not to bury more scourges of conflict in the region. We support the convening of a new international conference on the question of Palestine, support the exploration and innovation of the Middle East peace promotion mechanism, and push the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks out of the impasse as soon as possible based on the ""two-state plan"" and the ""Arab peace initiative"". , 　　 We want to give the Palestinian people more practical support. I announced that China will provide Palestine with 100 million yuan in free assistance to support Palestine's economic development and improve people's livelihood. China will also provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Palestine and make additional contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 As an important platform for China and Arab countries to carry out equal dialogue and strengthen pragmatic cooperation, the China-Arab Cooperation Forum has great potential in promoting the two sides to strengthen docking. To adapt to the development of China-Arab relations in the new era, the forum must have a new outlook and new actions. It is necessary to allocate resources reasonably, revitalize stocks, make good use of increments, strengthen mechanisms such as energy, news, Beidou Navigation, and Entrepreneur Forum, and actively promote the establishment of mechanisms for women, youth, and tourism. The work of the forum should be close to the actual needs of the two parties. By strengthening exchanges, the two sides' ideas can form more intersections, so that collective action will be more powerful. , 　　 Arabic proverb says, ""Language is leaf, action is fruit"".

Thank you. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (July 11, 2018, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Join hands to promote China-Arab strategic partnership in the new era,4145,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-07-11,"[, 尊敬的萨巴赫埃米尔殿下，, 尊敬的阿方主席、沙特外交大臣朱拜尔先生，, 尊敬的阿拉伯国家联盟秘书长盖特先生，, 各位代表团团长，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 大家上午好！, 　　4年前，我在这里向阿拉伯世界发出共建“一带一路”的邀请。今天，我们怀着对中阿合作美好未来的憧憬再度相聚于此。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，对各位嘉宾的到来表示诚挚的欢迎！对中阿合作论坛第八届部长级会议的召开表示热烈的祝贺！, 　　中阿友谊源远流长，历久弥新。中阿两大民族虽相隔遥远，却亲如一家。我们在古丝绸之路上“舟舶继路、商使交属”，在争取民族独立和人民解放的斗争中并肩奋斗、患难与共，在各自国家建设事业中相互支持、互利合作，谱写了合作共赢的灿烂篇章。历史和实践证明，无论国际风云如何变幻，无论面临怎样的艰难险阻，中阿始终是互惠互利的好伙伴、同甘共苦的好兄弟。, 　　为促进各国共同繁荣进步，中方倡议共建“一带一路”，秉持共商共建共享原则，推动政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通，得到包括阿拉伯世界在内的国际社会广泛支持和积极参与。作为历史上丝路文明的重要参与者和缔造者之一，阿拉伯国家身处“一带一路”交汇地带，是共建“一带一路”的天然合作伙伴。, 　　中国发表了对阿拉伯国家政策白皮书，“一带一路”成为中阿关系重要内容。阿拉伯国家联盟外长理事会通过决议，表达阿拉伯国家集体参与“一带一路”建设政治意愿。本届部长级会议上，中阿双方还将签署《中阿合作共建“一带一路”行动宣言》。, 　　4年来，我们携手同行，把“一带一路”同地区实际结合起来，把集体行动同双边合作结合起来，把促进发展同维护和平结合起来，优势互补，合作共赢，造福地区人民和世界人民。“一带一路”建设落地之处呈现出多姿多彩、生机勃勃的面貌，结出累累硕果。, 　　4年来，“一带一路”建设全面带动中阿关系发展，中阿全方位合作进入新阶段。在此，我宣布，经过中阿双方友好协商，我们一致同意建立全面合作、共同发展、面向未来的中阿战略伙伴关系。这是中阿友好合作新的历史起点。, 　　中方愿同阿方加强战略和行动对接，携手推进“一带一路”建设，共同做中东和平稳定的维护者、公平正义的捍卫者、共同发展的推动者、互学互鉴的好朋友，努力打造中阿命运共同体，为推动构建人类命运共同体作出贡献。, 　　第一，增进战略互信。“大道之行，天下为公。”当前，中东面临消除和平之殇、破解发展之困的紧迫任务，中国的中东政策顺应中东人民追求和平、期盼发展的强烈愿望，在国际上为阿拉伯国家合理诉求代言，愿为促进地区和平稳定发挥更大作用。, 　　我们要坚持对话协商。中东很多事情盘根错节，大家要商量着办，不能一家说了算，一家说了也不可能算。我们要坚守主权原则，反对搞分裂割据。我们要倡导包容性和解，反对搞压制性妥协。我们要反对恐怖主义，加强综合施策，抓好民生建设。, 　　中方愿围绕发展促和平、集体安全、人道主义救援、海上通道航行、无核武器区等广泛议题，同阿方开展更多对话协商。在此，我宣布，中方设立“以产业振兴带动经济重建专项计划”，提供200亿美元贷款额度，同有重建需求的国家加强合作，按照商业化原则推进就业面广、促稳效益好的项目。中国将再向叙利亚、也门、约旦、黎巴嫩人民提供6亿元人民币援助，用于当地人道主义和重建事业。中国还将同地区国家探讨实施总额为10亿元人民币的项目，支持有关国家维稳能力建设。, 　　第二，实现复兴梦想。阿拉伯世界区位条件优越、能源禀赋突出。中阿双方优势互补、利益交汇，我们要把彼此发展战略对接起来，让两大民族复兴之梦紧密相连。, 　　要牢牢抓住互联互通这个“龙头”。中方愿参与阿拉伯国家有关港口和未来阿拉伯铁路网建设，支持阿方构建连接中亚和东非、沟通印度洋和地中海的黄金枢纽物流网。我们要携手打造蓝色经济通道，共建海洋合作中心，促进海洋产业发展，提升海洋公共服务能力。要共建“一带一路”空间信息走廊，发展航天合作，推动中国北斗导航系统和气象遥感卫星技术服务阿拉伯国家建设。, 　　要积极推动油气合作、低碳能源合作“双轮”转动。我们要继续推进“油气+”合作模式，深化石油、天然气勘探、开采、炼化、储运等全产业链合作，要顺应全球能源革命、绿色低碳产业蓬勃发展，加强和平利用核能、太阳能、风能、水电等领域合作，共同构建油气牵引、核能跟进、清洁能源提速的中阿能源合作格局，打造互惠互利、长期友好的中阿能源战略合作关系。, 　　要努力实现金融合作、高新技术合作“两翼”齐飞。我们要研究如何发挥好高新技术的驱动作用和金融合作的服务支撑作用，为共建“一带一路”做好短期配合和长期配套，探索适合中东需求、体现中东特色的金融、科技合作模式。, 　　中方支持建立产能合作金融平台，围绕工业园建设拓展多元化投融资渠道，推进园区服务、企业成长、金融支持三位一体发展。中方支持中国有关金融证券机构同阿拉伯国家主权财富基金和管理机构合作，建立立足海湾、辐射中东北非、吸收全球投资者的国际交易平台，争取实现要素自由流动、资源高效配置、市场深度融合，服务“一带一路”建设。为推动金融同业交流合作，中方将成立“中国—阿拉伯国家银行联合体”，配备30亿美元金融合作专项贷款。, 　　中方愿结合阿拉伯国家中长期发展战略规划，加强双方数字经济、人工智能、新材料、生物制药、智慧城市等领域合作。我们要落实好中阿科技伙伴计划，在双方感兴趣的重点领域共建联合实验室。要加快网上丝绸之路建设，争取在网络基础设施、大数据、云计算、电子商务等领域达成更多合作共识和成果。, 　　第三，实现互利共赢。中国将坚持全面深化改革，坚持对外开放基本国策，坚持打开国门搞建设。未来5年，中国将进口超过8万亿美元商品，对外投资总额将超过7500亿美元，这将给阿拉伯国家带来更多合作机会和实实在在的利好。我们要继续用好支持中东工业化的专项贷款和优惠性质贷款，推动中国企业参与园区开发建设、招商运营，促进产业聚集。中国欢迎阿拉伯国家参加今年11月在上海举办的首届中国国际进口博览会，将在今后5年实现阿拉伯国家参加博览会及贸易和投资综合展全覆盖。中国愿务实推进同海湾阿拉伯国家合作委员会、巴勒斯坦自由贸易区谈判，也愿同更多阿拉伯国家探索商签全面自由贸易协定的可能性。, 　　第四，促进包容互鉴。文明的活力在于交往交流交融。历史上，中华文明和阿拉伯文明交相辉映。今天，我们要更多向对方汲取智慧和营养。我倡议成立的中阿改革发展研究中心运作良好，已成为双方交流改革开放、治国理政经验的思想平台。今后，中心要做大做强，为双方提供更多智力支持。, 　　我们要传播重和平、尚和谐、求真知的理念，办好中阿文明对话暨去极端化圆桌会议。我们要以对话消除误解，以包容化解分歧，营造正信正行的良好氛围。我们要深入挖掘不同宗教中增进和谐、健康向上的内容，结合时代进步要求做好教义阐释。我们要合作建设网络文明，共同反对网络上宣扬极端、散布仇恨的言论。, 　　为推动中阿人民情感交流、心灵沟通，未来3年，中国将再从阿拉伯国家邀请100名青年创新领袖、200名青年科学家、300名科技人员来华研讨，再邀请100名宗教人士、600名政党领导人访华，再为阿拉伯国家提供1万个各类培训名额，再向阿拉伯国家派遣500名医疗队员。, 　　我在此宣布，中阿新闻交流中心正式成立，中阿电子图书馆门户网站项目正式启动，中阿共同在华举办的第四届“阿拉伯艺术节”正式启动。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中阿同为国际舞台上重要政治力量，中阿合作应该在世界发展进步的大潮中不断发展，在人类历史前进的步伐中不断前进。和平、改革、发展是中东各国的普遍需要，稳定、安宁、幸福是中东人民的共同追求。各方要准确把握历史大势，真诚回应人民呼声，一起推动中东地区走出一条全面振兴的新路。, 　　中东的多样性应该成为地区活力之源。要尊重每个国家的国情差异和自主选择，坚持平等相待、求同存异。域外力量应该多做劝和促谈的事，为中东和平发展提供正能量。要摒弃独享安全、绝对安全的想法，不搞你输我赢、唯我独尊，打造共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全架构。, 　　发展是解决中东许多治理问题的钥匙。发展的潜力要通过改革来释放，进步的动力要通过开放来提升。各方要始终心系合作，多做共赢的加法和乘法，把一股股发展努力汇聚起来，优势互补，共享繁荣。, 　　阿拉伯民族是古老、坚韧、充满智慧的民族，以不惧挑战、勇追时代潮流的精神创造了辉煌的文明。只要阿拉伯国家团结起来，任何困难和风险都挡不住你们。, 　　巴勒斯坦问题是中东和平的根源性问题。中国人民历来富有正义感和同情心。我们呼吁有关各方遵守国际共识、公正处理巴勒斯坦有关问题，不要给地区埋下更多冲突祸根。我们支持召开新的巴勒斯坦问题国际会议，支持探索创新中东促和机制，以“两国方案”和“阿拉伯和平倡议”为基础，推动巴以和谈尽快走出僵局。, 　　我们要给予巴勒斯坦人民更多实际支持。我宣布，中国再向巴勒斯坦提供1亿元人民币无偿援助，用于支持巴勒斯坦发展经济、改善民生。中国还将向巴勒斯坦提供紧急人道主义援助，并向联合国近东巴勒斯坦难民救济和工程处追加捐款。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　作为中阿双方开展平等对话、加强务实合作的重要平台，中阿合作论坛在推动双方加强对接方面大有可为。要适应新时代中阿关系发展，论坛建设要有新气象、新作为。要合理配置资源，盘活存量，用好增量，做强能源、新闻、北斗导航、企业家论坛等机制，积极推动建立妇女、青年、旅游等机制。论坛工作要贴近双方实际需要，通过加强交流，让双方思想形成更多交汇，这样集体行动才会更有力量。, 　　阿拉伯谚语讲，“语言是叶子，行动才是果实”。中国古人讲，“锲而不舍，金石可镂”。让我们发扬丝路精神，一步一个脚印朝着目标前行，为实现中阿两大民族伟大复兴、推动建设中阿利益和命运共同体而不懈努力！, 　　最后，我预祝这次会议取得圆满成功。, 　　舒克拉！谢谢。, 　　（新华社北京7月10日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2018年07月11日 02 版）, ]",习近平：携手推进新时代中阿战略伙伴关系,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/30139172
17,133,"[, Dear Prime Minister O’Neill, Dear Chairman Taurica, Dear friends from industry and commerce,, Ladies and gentlemen, Hello everyone! It is a pleasure to come to the beautiful Port Moresby and get together with you on the Pacific Explorer. In today's world of economic turbulence and the emergence of risk challenges, it is of special significance for us to plan development cooperation together on the same boat. , 　　 The theme of this business summit is ""Promoting Inclusion in an Era of Disruptive Change: Planning a Common Future"", which has a profound meaning. The world today is in a period of major development, major changes, and major adjustments. The tide of economic globalization is rolling forward, but protectionism and unilateralism have cast a shadow over world economic growth. New technological revolutions and industrial changes are poised to take off, but the conversion of growth kinetic energy between old and new has not yet been completed. The international pattern has evolved profoundly, but the imbalance in development has not changed fundamentally. The global governance system is accelerating changes, but lagging governance remains a prominent challenge. , 　　 The change in the world today has not happened for a century. Change will create new opportunities, but the process of change is often full of risks and challenges, and humanity has once again stood at a crossroads. Cooperation or confrontation? Open or closed? Mutually beneficial and win-win or zero-sum game? How to answer these questions is related to the interests of all countries and the future and destiny of mankind. , 　　 Looking back at the history of the world since modern times, we can clearly see that different choices once brought a very different historical trajectory to the world. , 　　 Asia-Pacific region has such success stories as APEC. The birth and development of APEC conforms to the historical trend of openness and integration, the strong desire for development in the Asia-Pacific region, and the common needs of people of all countries to meet challenges together. Asia-Pacific open cooperation not only spurs the Pacific Ocean, but also enlivens the oceans of the world economy. Today's Asia-Pacific is the economic sector with the most growth vitality and development potential in the world, and it is also recognized as an important engine of world economic growth. , 　　 However, not all stories are so beautiful, and humans have had painful lessons. The Second World War that took place in the last century has plunged mankind into a tremendous catastrophe. Not far from us, the tragic Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Guadalcanal during the Second World War broke out. Today, this sea surface has been calm, but we cannot forget the ups and downs of history. , 　　 ""The mirror mirrors the shape, the ancient things know the present."" When we look back at history, we should use history as a mirror and not let historical tragedies repeat. Facing the historical tide, how can we grasp the correct direction for the development of the world economy? How can we find effective governance ideas for the international community? Here, I would like to make the following claims. , 　　 First, adhere to the open orientation and expand the development space. Economic globalization is the only way for human society to develop. The multilateral trading system has brought common opportunities to all countries. In today's increasingly interdependent countries, global supply chains, industrial chains, and value chains are closely linked. Each country is a link in the global cooperation chain, and a community of interests and a community of destiny are increasingly formed. , 　　 This is due to economic laws, and it is not based on human will. We should grasp the trend of the times, objectively understand the development and changes of the world, and respond to new situations and challenges in a responsible and compliant manner. If artificial barriers are set up to cut off the close economic links of various countries, it not only violates the economic laws and historical trends, but also does not meet the general aspirations of the people of all countries. It is short-sighted and unsuccessful. , 　　 An era has an era problem. The problem itself is not terrible, the key is to take the correct approach to solve the problem. Taking the old path of protectionism and unilateralism will not only solve the problem, but also increase the uncertainty of the world economy. History has proved that only by adhering to open cooperation can we gain more opportunities and space for development. Self-closure will only lose the world, and eventually lose ourselves. , 　　 APEC is a pioneer in building an open world economy. The Bogor goal will expire in 2020. We should focus on the vision of cooperation after 2020 and insist on advancing the construction of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area. We should clearly oppose protectionism and unilateralism, safeguard the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization as the core, guide economic globalization to develop in a more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win direction, and expand commonality in opening up Benefits, share opportunities in cooperation. , 　　 Second, adhere to the development orientation and enhance the well-being of the people. We should put the welfare of the people first. All countries in the world have equal rights to development, and no one has the right and can not stop people in developing countries from pursuing a better life. We should be committed to strengthening development cooperation, helping developing countries get rid of poverty, and let the people of all countries live a good life. This is the biggest publicbegging. We should be committed to strengthening development cooperation, helping developing countries get rid of poverty, and let the people of all countries live a good life. This is the greatest fairness and the moral responsibility of the international community. , 　　 We should incorporate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into our national development strategy, promote coordinated economic, social, and environmental development, promote inclusive development according to our own national conditions, and actively build an equal and balanced global development partnership. Developed countries should honor their official development assistance commitments and increase their support for developing countries. , 　　 We should strengthen the position of development in the coordination of international economic policies. When discussing policies and rules in various fields such as trade and investment, intellectual property protection, and the digital economy, we should have a clear development perspective to create common development opportunities and space for all countries. To provide strong momentum and a stable environment for world economic growth. ""Special and differential treatment"" is an important cornerstone of the World Trade Organization. This principle cannot be denied, otherwise it will shake the foundation of the multilateral trading system. , 　　 Third, adhere to an inclusive orientation and promote mutual learning. We live together on the same planet. This planet has more than 200 countries and regions, more than 2,500 ethnic groups, and a population of more than 7 billion. It is impossible to understand everything. This difference should not be an obstacle to communication, nor a reason for confrontation. The diversity of different civilizations, systems and roads, as well as exchanges and mutual learning, can provide a powerful impetus for the progress of human society. We should have less arrogance and prejudice, more respect and tolerance, embrace the richness and diversity of the world, strive to seek common ground while reserving differences, learn from each other's strengths, seek harmonious coexistence and win-win cooperation. , 　　 What kind of path a country takes, only the people of this country have the most say. One prescription cannot cure all diseases, and one model cannot solve all countries' problems. Unreasonable or forced on people will cause dissatisfaction. , 　　 Fourth, adhere to the innovation orientation and open up a source of growth. At present, information technology, life sciences, intelligent manufacturing, green energy and other frontier fields are constantly breaking through, and the iterative cycle of new materials, new products, and new formats is constantly shortening. Big data, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, these once scientific illusions, have now been integrated into people's clothing, food, housing and transportation, and the future has come to us. , 　　 Hundreds of people contend for the flow, and those who persevere first. The wave of times of the new technological revolution and industrial transformation is coming. If we do not adapt and change, we will miss development opportunities and even miss the entire era. We should explore the new growth momentum and development path in a spirit of striving for the day and night, eliminate all institutional and institutional obstacles that are not conducive to innovation, fully stimulate the potential of innovation and market vitality, deepen international innovation exchanges and cooperation, and better respond to their respective and common development. challenge. , 　　 The new technological revolution and industrial transformation are all-round changes that will have a profound impact on human production patterns, lifestyles, and values. The relationship between equity and efficiency, capital and labor, technology and employment has become a common issue of the international community, and improper handling will lead to a further widening of the gap between the rich and the poor between the north and the south. We should review the situation, make scientific decisions, and lead the new technological revolution and industrial transformation in the right direction.　　Serving the people is the essential requirement of scientific and technological innovation, and all countries have the right to benefit from scientific and technological innovation through their own efforts and international cooperation. Scientific and technological innovations should not be blocked and should not be used as a tool for the benefit of only a few people. The purpose of establishing an intellectual property system is to protect and encourage innovation, not to create or even widen the scientific and technological gap. We should jointly discuss the establishment of a policy and system oriented to the new technological revolution and industrial transformation, create an international cooperation environment, and allow scientific and technological innovations to be reached, shared, and used by more countries and people. , 　　 Fifth, adhere to the rule-based approach and improve global governance. The painful lessons of the two world wars have made people of all countries painful and painful, and established a global governance framework with the United Nations as the main body, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. Although this framework is not perfect, it is an important step taken by human society and played an important role in world peace and development in the past few decades. Strengthening global governance based on rules is a necessary prerequisite for stable development. The rules should be formulated jointly by the international community, not whoever has the thick arms and the strongest strength will have the final say, and will not be able to engage in pragmatism and double standards. , 　　 If the global economic governance system is to be fair and effective, it must keep up with the times. We should uphold the concept of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, and promote the reform of the global economic governance system. The process of change should reflect the spirit of equality, openness, transparency, and inclusiveness, improve the representativeness and voice of developing countries, and should be resolved through consultations when encountering differences, and should not engage in small circles or be imposed on others. History tells us that if we embark on a road of confrontation, whether it is a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, there will be no real winners. Country to countryAdd to people. History tells us that if we embark on a road of confrontation, whether it is a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, there will be no real winners. As long as countries treat each other as equals and understand each other, there will be no problems that cannot be resolved through consultation. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 In 1978, the great journey of China's reform and opening up kicked off. Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people have relied on their wisdom and hard-working hands to forge ahead in the wind and rain, ushered in a historical leap from standing up, getting rich, and becoming strong, and ushered in the glorious course of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. , 　　——For 40 years, the Chinese people have been courageous to explore and work hard. With a pioneering and innovative spirit and a self-reliant tenacity, China has become the world’s second largest economy, the face of China, and the face of the Chinese people. Earth-shaking changes have taken place. Today in China, the Chinese people did it! , 　　——In the past 40 years, the Chinese people have opened their minds and embraced the world, insisting on opening the country to engage in construction. China’s total import and export of goods has increased by 198 times, and the total value of imports and exports of service trade has increased by more than 147 times. It has become the world's largest trading country for goods, the largest tourist market, and a major trading partner for more than 130 countries. , 　　——For 40 years, the Chinese people have focused on development and benefited the people, and adhered to the people-centered development concept. From 1978 to 2017, China’s per capita disposable income increased by 22.8 times, the number of poor people decreased by 740 million, and the number of employees has doubled. For a while, free and compulsory education in urban and rural areas was fully realized, the social security system with the largest population in the world was basically established, and the Chinese people's sense of gain, happiness, and security were significantly improved. , 　　-For 40 years, the Chinese people have stood up to one another and sought common development. They have always taken the path of peaceful development, actively participated in global economic governance, actively supported the development of the vast number of developing countries, implemented responsible macroeconomic policies, and maintained The higher contribution rate of economic growth has made its own contribution to coping with the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis, and contributed wisdom and strength to the construction of a community of shared future for mankind. , 　　 Five years ago, I put forward the initiative to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative, the purpose of which was to promote the interconnectedness of all countries and regions, form a joint development pattern, and expand new growth space for the world economy. Over the past five years, the ""Belt and Road"" initiative has been very popular. China has signed cooperation agreements with more than 140 countries and international organizations, and a large number of major cooperation projects have taken root. , 　　 I want to emphasize that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” is an open platform for cooperation, upholding the basic principles of mutual consultation, joint construction, and sharing. There is no geopolitical purpose, nor does it exclude anyone, and does not close the door. Engaging in small circles is not a so-called ""trap"" that some people say, but a sunshine avenue for China to share opportunities and seek common development with the world. China will host the second ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum in Beijing next April. Welcome friends from the Asia-Pacific business community to participate actively. , 　　Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, the Chinese people have more firmly realized that only reform and opening up can develop China. Facing the future, China will make greater contributions to the common prosperity of all countries in the world while achieving its own development with a more responsible spirit, a more open and inclusive mind, and higher-quality growth. , 　　 China will continue to greatly relax market access, strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights, and actively expand imports. Since the beginning of this year, China has successively announced a series of new opening measures, including creating a more attractive investment and business environment, greatly reducing the import tariffs on 1449 kinds of daily consumer goods, 1585 kinds of industrial products, and other The tax rate was reduced to 13.8% and 6% respectively, and all tariffs for imported anti-cancer drugs were achieved. With the implementation of a new round of tax reduction measures on November 1, China's total tariff level has been reduced to 7.5%, exceeding the commitment to the World Trade Organization and also lower than most developing countries. China has released a new negative list for foreign investment access, which is further opened up in the fields of finance, automobiles, airplanes, and ships. According to a World Bank report, China's business environment ranking has increased by more than 30 places compared to last year, making it one of the economies with the largest improvement in business environment. China treats domestic and foreign companies equally and equally, and welcomes and encourages all types of enterprises to compete fairly, and will fully protect their legitimate rights and interests. , 　　 A week ago, the first China International Import Expo was successfully held in Shanghai, attracting 172 countries, regions and international organizations, more than 3600 enterprises participated in the exhibition, more than 400,000 domestic and foreign buyers attended the meeting to discuss procurement, and the turnover reached 57.8 billion US dollars . More than 4500 celebrities from all walks of life attended the Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum. China's actions prove that it supports trade liberalization and actively opens the market to the worldyuan. More than 4500 celebrities from all walks of life attended the Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum. China's actions have proved its determination to support trade liberalization and actively open the market to the world. Everyone is welcome to participate in the second China International Import Expo next year. I believe that China's large market of nearly 1.4 billion people will surely become the source of growth and vitality for the world economy! , 　　 Many entrepreneurs present here are witnesses, contributors, and beneficiaries of China's reform and opening up, and have formed an inseparable bond with China. The business sector is an important force leading economic growth in the Asia-Pacific and the world. I hope that you can play an entrepreneurial spirit, be a courageous player in economic globalization, continue to make wise suggestions for policy makers, promote active and pragmatic policies in various countries, and carry out extensive economic and technological cooperation to break new ground for the common development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 APEC is bound by water. When I boarded the ship just now, looking at the vast ocean, I thought of the word ""together in the same boat"". Let's hold the steering wheel firmly, steer the quasi-heading, paddle together, ride the wind and waves, and drive the big ship of the world economy to a better shore! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Port Moresby, November 17), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (November 18, 2018, 02 edition),]",Working together to create a better future,4878,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2018-11-18,"[, 尊敬的奥尼尔总理，, 尊敬的陶里卡主席，, 各位工商界朋友，, 女士们，先生们：, 　　大家好！很高兴来到景色宜人的莫尔兹比港，同大家相聚在太平洋探索者号上。在当今世界经济风起云涌、风险挑战凸显的形势下，我们同在一条船上，一起谋划发展合作，具有特别的意义。, 　　这次工商峰会的主题“在颠覆性变革时代促进包容：规划共同未来”，寓意深刻。当今世界正处于大发展大变革大调整时期。经济全球化大潮滚滚向前，但保护主义、单边主义为世界经济增长蒙上了阴影。新科技革命和产业变革蓄势待发，但增长新旧动能转换尚未完成。国际格局深刻演变，但发展失衡未有根本改观。全球治理体系加快变革，但治理滞后仍是突出挑战。, 　　当今世界的变局百年未有，变革会催生新的机遇，但变革过程往往充满着风险挑战，人类又一次站在了十字路口。合作还是对抗？开放还是封闭？互利共赢还是零和博弈？如何回答这些问题，关乎各国利益，关乎人类前途命运。, 　　回顾近代以来的世界历史，我们可以清楚地看到，不同选择曾经给世界带来迥异的历史轨迹。, 　　亚太地区有着亚太经合组织这样的成功故事。亚太经合组织的诞生和发展顺应了开放融合的历史潮流，顺应了亚太地区谋求发展的强烈愿望，顺应了各国人民携手应对挑战的共同需要。亚太的开放合作不仅激荡着太平洋，也活跃了世界经济的海洋。如今的亚太，是全球最具增长活力和发展潜力的经济板块，也是举世公认的世界经济增长的一个重要引擎。, 　　然而，不是所有故事都这么美好，人类也有过惨痛教训。上世纪发生的第二次世界大战，让人类陷入了滔天浩劫。就在离我们不远的地方，曾经爆发第二次世界大战期间惨烈的珊瑚海战役、瓜达尔卡纳尔战役。今天，这片海面已经波澜不惊，但我们不能忘却历史上的风风雨雨。, 　　“明镜所以照形，古事所以知今。”我们回顾历史，是要以史为鉴，不让历史悲剧重演。面对历史大潮，如何才能为世界经济发展把握正确方向？如何才能为国际社会找到有效治理思路？这里，我愿提出以下主张。, 　　第一，坚持开放导向，拓展发展空间。经济全球化是人类社会发展必经之路，多边贸易体制为各国带来了共同机遇。在各国相互依存日益紧密的今天，全球供应链、产业链、价值链紧密联系，各国都是全球合作链条中的一环，日益形成利益共同体、命运共同体。, 　　这是经济规律使然，不以人的意志为转移。我们应该把握时代大势，客观认识世界发展变化，以负责任、合规矩的方式应对新情况新挑战。如果人为设置壁垒，切断各国经济上的密切联系，不仅违背经济规律和历史潮流，也不符合各国人民普遍愿望，既是短视的，也是不会成功的。, 　　一个时代有一个时代的问题。问题本身并不可怕，关键是采取正确的办法来解决问题。走保护主义、单边主义的老路，不仅解决不了问题，还会加剧世界经济的不确定性。历史已经证明，只有坚持开放合作才能获得更多发展机遇和更大发展空间，自我封闭只会失去世界，最终也会失去自己。, 　　亚太经合组织是建设开放型世界经济的先驱。茂物目标将于2020年到期，我们应该着眼2020年后合作愿景，坚持推进亚太自由贸易区建设。我们应该旗帜鲜明反对保护主义、单边主义，维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，引导经济全球化朝着更加开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的方向发展，在开放中扩大共同利益，在合作中实现机遇共享。, 　　第二，坚持发展导向，增进人民福祉。我们应该把人民福祉放在首位。世界上所有国家都享有平等的发展权利，任何人都无权也不能阻挡发展中国家人民对美好生活的追求。我们应该致力于加强发展合作，帮助发展中国家摆脱贫困，让所有国家的人民都过上好日子。这才是最大的公平，也是国际社会的道义责任。, 　　我们应该把落实2030年可持续发展议程纳入本国发展战略，促进经济、社会、环境协调发展，根据自身国情推动普惠发展，积极构建平等均衡的全球发展伙伴关系。发达国家应该履行官方发展援助承诺，增加对广大发展中国家的支持。, 　　我们应该加强发展在国际经济政策协调中的地位，在讨论制定贸易和投资、知识产权保护、数字经济等各领域政策和规则时应该有明确的发展视角，为各国营造共同的发展机遇和空间，为世界经济增长提供强劲动力和稳定环境。“特殊与差别待遇”是世界贸易组织的重要基石。这一原则不能否定，否则将动摇多边贸易体制的根基。, 　　第三，坚持包容导向，促进交融互鉴。我们共同居住在同一个星球上，这个星球有200多个国家和地区、2500多个民族、70多亿人口，搞清一色是不可能的。这种差异不应该成为交流的障碍，更不能成为对抗的理由。不同文明、制度、道路的多样性及交流互鉴可以为人类社会进步提供强大动力。我们应该少一点傲慢和偏见、多一些尊重和包容，拥抱世界的丰富多样，努力做到求同存异、取长补短，谋求和谐共处、合作共赢。, 　　一个国家走什么样的道路，只有这个国家的人民最有发言权。一副药方不可能包治百病，一种模式也不可能解决所有国家的问题。生搬硬套或强加于人都会引起水土不服。, 　　第四，坚持创新导向，开辟增长源泉。当前，信息技术、生命科学、智能制造、绿色能源等前沿领域不断突破，新材料、新产品、新业态迭代周期不断缩短。大数据、3D打印、人工智能，这些曾经的科学幻想，如今已经融入人们的衣食住行用，未来已经来到我们身边。, 　　百舸争流，奋楫者先。新科技革命和产业变革的时代浪潮奔腾而至，如果我们不应变、不求变，将错失发展机遇，甚至错过整个时代。我们应该以只争朝夕的精神，探寻新的增长动力和发展路径，消除一切不利于创新的体制机制障碍，充分激发创新潜能和市场活力，深化国际创新交流合作，更好应对各自和共同的发展挑战。, 　　新科技革命和产业变革是一次全方位变革，将对人类生产模式、生活方式、价值理念产生深刻影响。公平和效率、资本和劳动、技术和就业的关系成为国际社会的共同课题，处理不当将导致南北贫富差距进一步拉大。我们应该审时度势、科学决策，引领新科技革命和产业变革朝着正确方向发展。, 　　服务人民是科技创新的本质要求，各国都有权通过自身努力和国际合作从科技创新中受益。科技创新成果不应该被封锁起来，不应该成为只为少数人牟利的工具。设立知识产权制度的目的是保护和激励创新，而不是制造甚至扩大科技鸿沟。我们应该共同探讨建立面向新科技革命和产业变革的政策制度体系，营造国际合作环境，让科技创新成果为更多国家和人民所及、所享、所用。, 　　第五，坚持规则导向，完善全球治理。两次世界大战的惨痛教训让各国人民痛定思痛，建立了以联合国为主体，包括国际货币基金组织、世界银行、世界贸易组织等机制的全球治理框架。虽然这个框架并不完美，却是人类社会迈出的重要一步，为过去几十年世界和平与发展发挥了重要作用。以规则为基础加强全球治理是实现稳定发展的必要前提。规则应该由国际社会共同制定，而不是谁的胳膊粗、气力大谁就说了算，更不能搞实用主义、双重标准，合则用、不合则弃。, 　　全球经济治理体系要想公平有效，必须跟上时代。我们应该秉持共商共建共享理念，推动全球经济治理体系变革。变革过程应该体现平等、开放、透明、包容精神，提高发展中国家代表性和发言权，遇到分歧应该通过协商解决，不能搞小圈子，不能强加于人。历史告诉我们，如果走上对抗的道路，无论是冷战、热战还是贸易战，都不会有真正的赢家。国与国只要平等相待、互谅互让，就没有通过协商解决不了的问题。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　1978年，中国改革开放的伟大征程拉开了序幕。40年来，中国人民依靠自己的智慧和勤劳的双手，在风雨中砥砺前行，迎来了从站起来、富起来到强起来的历史飞跃，开启了中华民族伟大复兴的光辉历程。, 　　——40年来，中国人民勇于探索、真抓实干，凭着一股开拓创新的拼劲，一股自力更生的韧劲，把中国建成了世界第二大经济体，中国的面貌、中国人民的面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。中国的今天，是中国人民干出来的！, 　　——40年来，中国人民敞开胸怀、拥抱世界，坚持打开国门搞建设，中国货物进出口总额增长198倍，服务贸易进出口总额增长超过147倍，累计吸引外资超过2万亿美元，中国已经成为世界第一大货物贸易国、最大的旅游市场、130多个国家的主要贸易伙伴。, 　　——40年来，中国人民聚焦发展、造福人民，坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，从1978年到2017年，中国人均可支配收入增长22.8倍，贫困人口减少了7.4亿，就业人员翻了一番，城乡免费义务教育全面实现，世界上覆盖人口最多的社会保障体系基本建立，中国人民的获得感、幸福感、安全感显著提高。, 　　——40年来，中国人民立己达人、共谋发展，始终不渝走和平发展道路，积极参与全球经济治理，积极支持广大发展中国家发展，实施负责任的宏观经济政策，保持对世界经济增长的较高贡献率，为应对亚洲金融危机、国际金融危机作出了自己的贡献，为推动构建人类命运共同体贡献了智慧和力量。, 　　5年前，我提出共建“一带一路”倡议，目的就是促进各国各地区互联互通，形成联动发展格局，为世界经济拓展新的增长空间。5年来，共建“一带一路”倡议广受欢迎，中国已经同140多个国家和国际组织签署共建“一带一路”合作协议，一大批重大合作项目已经落地生根。, 　　我要强调的是，共建“一带一路”是开放的合作平台，秉持的是共商共建共享的基本原则，没有地缘政治目的，不针对谁也不排除谁，不会关起门来搞小圈子，不是有人说的这样那样的所谓“陷阱”，而是中国同世界共享机遇、共谋发展的阳光大道。中国将于明年4月在北京举办第二届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛。欢迎亚太工商界朋友积极参与。, 　　回首40年改革开放历程，中国人民更加坚定地认识到，只有改革开放才能发展中国。面向未来，中国将以更负责的精神、更开放包容的胸襟、更高质量的增长，在实现自身发展的同时，为世界各国共同繁荣作出更大贡献。, 　　中国将继续大幅放宽市场准入，加强知识产权保护，主动扩大进口。今年以来，中国陆续宣布了一系列新的开放举措，包括创造更具吸引力的投资营商环境，大幅降低1449种日用消费品、1585种工业品等商品进口关税，将汽车整车和零部件税率分别降到13.8%和6%，实现进口抗癌药全部零关税。随着11月1日新一轮降税措施实施，中国关税总水平已经降到7.5%，超出了对世界贸易组织的承诺，也低于大多数发展中国家。中国发布了外商投资准入新的负面清单，在金融、汽车、飞机、船舶等领域进一步开放。根据世界银行的报告，中国营商环境排名比去年提升30多位，成为营商环境改善幅度最大的经济体之一。中国对内外资企业一视同仁、平等对待，欢迎和鼓励各类企业公平竞争，也将充分保障它们的合法权益。, 　　一周前，首届中国国际进口博览会在上海成功举行，吸引了172个国家、地区和国际组织，3600多家企业参展，40多万名境内外采购商到会洽谈采购，成交额达到578亿美元。4500多名各界知名人士出席虹桥国际经贸论坛。中国用行动证明了支持贸易自由化、主动向世界开放市场的决心。欢迎大家明年参加第二届中国国际进口博览会。我相信，中国近14亿人口的大市场必将成为世界经济的增长之源、活力之源！, 　　在座许多企业家都是中国改革开放的见证者、贡献者、受益者，同中国结下了不解之缘。工商界是引领亚太和世界经济增长的重要力量。希望你们发挥企业家精神，勇做经济全球化的弄潮儿，继续为决策者提出明智建议，推动各国采取积极务实政策，广泛开展经济技术合作，为亚太地区乃至世界共同发展繁荣闯出新的天地。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　亚太经合组织因水结缘。刚才登船时，望着广袤无边的大海，我想到了“同舟共济”这个词。让我们握稳舵盘、把准航向、齐力划桨、乘风破浪，共同驾驶着世界经济的大船驶向更加美好的彼岸！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社莫尔兹比港11月17日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2018年11月18日 02 版）,

Let us welcome them with warm applause! , 　　 colleagues, ladies and gentlemen! , 　　 More than a month ago, I visited Africa for the fourth time as the President of China. This is also my ninth time to set foot on this hot spot in Africa. During my visit, I once again witnessed the rich and beautiful land of Africa, the development of Africa is full of vitality, and the African people yearn for a happy life.

History has its laws and logic. Based on similar encounters and common missions, China and Africa have worked together in the past years and watched each other for help. They have embarked on a road of win-win cooperation with distinctive characteristics. , 　　 On this road, China has always upheld the true and sincere concept and the correct view of justice and benefit, and united with African countries, working together and advancing together. , 　　——China adheres to sincerity, friendship and equality in cooperation.

Whether China-Africa cooperation is good or not, only the people of China and Africa have the most say. No one can deny the remarkable achievements of China-Africa cooperation with imagination and speculation! , 　　-China adheres to openness, tolerance, and inclusion in its cooperation. China has always believed that Africa’s long-term peace and stability, development and revitalization are the wishes of the African people and the responsibility of the international community. China is willing to work with international partners to support peace and development in Africa. We welcome and support everything that is beneficial to Africa, and the world should do its best to do it seriously.

　　九月的北京，金风送爽，秋色怡人。在这美好的季节，中非友好大家庭的新老朋友们再次相聚，共襄2018年中非合作论坛北京峰会盛举，我们感到十分高兴。, 　　首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，对各位同事和嘉宾的到来表示热烈的欢迎！我也愿通过你们，向兄弟的非洲人民转达中国人民的诚挚问候和良好祝愿！, 　　我要特别提到的是，自约翰内斯堡峰会以来，中非合作论坛相继增加了冈比亚、圣多美和普林西比、布基纳法索3名新成员。今天，巴罗总统、特罗瓦达总理、卡博雷总统分别率领三国代表团出席北京峰会，让我们以热烈的掌声欢迎他们！, 　　各位同事、女士们、先生们！, 　　一个多月前，我以中国国家主席身份第四次访问了非洲，这也是我本人第九次踏上非洲这片热土。访问期间，我再次目睹了非洲大地富饶美丽，非洲发展充满生机，非洲人民渴望幸福生活。我也更加坚定了这样的信念：非洲发展不可限量，非洲未来充满希望，中非友好合作前景广阔，中非全面战略合作伙伴关系发展大有可为！, 　　“根之茂者其实遂，膏之沃者其光晔。”历史有其规律和逻辑。中非双方基于相似遭遇和共同使命，在过去的岁月里同心同向、守望相助，走出了一条特色鲜明的合作共赢之路。, 　　在这条道路上，中国始终秉持真实亲诚理念和正确义利观，同非洲各国团结一心、同舟共济、携手前进。, 　　——中国在合作中坚持真诚友好、平等相待。13亿多中国人民始终同12亿多非洲人民同呼吸、共命运，始终尊重非洲、热爱非洲、支持非洲，坚持做到“五不”，即：不干预非洲国家探索符合国情的发展道路，不干涉非洲内政，不把自己的意志强加于人，不在对非援助中附加任何政治条件，不在对非投资融资中谋取政治私利。中国希望各国都能在处理非洲事务时做到这“五不”。中国永远是非洲的好朋友、好伙伴、好兄弟。任何人都不能破坏中非人民的大团结！,

——中国人民是具有伟大梦想精神的人民。在几千年历史长河中，中国人民始终心怀梦想、不懈追求，我们不仅形成了小康生活的理念，而且秉持天下为公的情怀，盘古开天、女娲补天、伏羲画卦、神农尝草、夸父追日、精卫填海、愚公移山等我国古代神话深刻反映了中国人民勇于追求和实现梦想的执着精神。中国人民相信，山再高，往上攀，总能登顶；路再长，走下去，定能到达。近代以来，实现中华民族伟大复兴成为中华民族最伟大的梦想，中国人民百折不挠、坚忍不拔，以同敌人血战到底的气概、在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心、自立于世界民族之林的能力，为实现这个伟大梦想进行了170多年的持续奋斗。今天，中国人民比历史上任何时期都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴。我相信，只要13亿多中国人民始终发扬这种伟大梦想精神，我们就一定能够实现中华民族伟大复兴！, 同志们！有这样伟大的人民，有这样伟大的民族，有这样的伟大民族精神，是我们的骄傲，是我们坚定中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信的底气，也是我们风雨无阻、高歌行进的根本力量！, 我国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家，国家一切权力属于人民。我们必须始终坚持人民立场，坚持人民主体地位，虚心向人民学习，倾听人民呼声，汲取人民智慧，把人民拥护不拥护、赞成不赞成、高兴不高兴、答应不答应作为衡量一切工作得失的根本标准，着力解决好人民最关心最直接最现实的利益问题，让全体中国人民和中华儿女在实现中华民族伟大复兴的历史进程中共享幸福和荣光！, 各位代表！,

我们要适应我国发展新的历史方位，紧扣我国社会主要矛盾的变化，高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，全面贯彻党的十九大和十九届二中、三中全会精神，坚持以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观、新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，统揽伟大斗争、伟大工程、伟大事业、伟大梦想，统筹推进“五位一体”总体布局，协调推进“四个全面”战略布局，奋力开创新时代中国特色社会主义事业新局面！,

维护国家主权和领土完整，实现祖国完全统一，是全体中华儿女共同愿望，是中华民族根本利益所在。在这个民族大义和历史潮流面前，一切分裂祖国的行径和伎俩都是注定要失败的，都会受到人民的谴责和历史的惩罚！中国人民有坚定的意志、充分的信心、足够的能力挫败一切分裂国家的活动！中国人民和中华民族有一个共同信念，这就是：我们伟大祖国的每一寸领土都绝对不能也绝对不可能从中国分割出去！, 各位代表！, 我们生活的世界充满希望，也充满挑战。中国人民历来富有正义感和同情心，历来把自己的前途命运同各国人民的前途命运紧密联系在一起，始终密切关注和无私帮助仍然生活在战火、动荡、饥饿、贫困中的有关国家的人民，始终愿意尽最大努力为人类和平与发展作出贡献。中国人民这个愿望是真诚的，中国决不会以牺牲别国利益为代价来发展自己，中国发展不对任何国家构成威胁，中国永远不称霸、永远不搞扩张。只有那些习惯于威胁他人的人，才会把所有人都看成是威胁。对中国人民为人类和平与发展作贡献的真诚愿望和实际行动，任何人都不应该误读，更不应该曲解。人间自有公道在！, 中国将继续高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，始终不渝走和平发展道路、奉行互利共赢的开放战略。中国将继续积极维护国际公平正义，主张世界上的事情应该由各国人民商量着办，不会把自己的意志强加于人。中国将继续积极推进“一带一路”建设，加强同世界各国的交流合作，让中国改革发展造福人类。中国将继续积极参与全球治理体系变革和建设，为世界贡献更多中国智慧、中国方案、中国力量，推动建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界，让人类命运共同体建设的阳光普照世界！, 各位代表！, 中国共产党领导是中国特色社会主义最本质的特征，中国共产党是国家最高政治领导力量，是实现中华民族伟大复兴的根本保证。东西南北中，党政军民学，党是领导一切的。全国各党派、各团体、各民族、各阶层、各界人士要紧密团结在党中央周围，增强“四个意识”，坚定“四个自信”，万众一心向前进。, 中国共产党要担负起领导人民进行伟大社会革命的历史责任，必须勇于进行自我革命，坚持立党为公、执政为民，深入推进全面从严治党，坚决扫除一切消极腐败现象，始终与人民心心相印、与人民同甘共苦、与人民团结奋斗，永远保持马克思主义执政党本色，永远走在时代前列，永远做中国人民和中华民族的主心骨！, 各位代表！, “等闲识得东风面，万紫千红总是春。”在中国共产党领导下，经过近70年奋斗，我们的人民共和国茁壮成长，正以崭新的姿态屹立于世界东方！, 新时代属于每一个人，每一个人都是新时代的见证者、开创者、建设者。只要精诚团结、共同奋斗，就没有任何力量能够阻挡中国人民实现梦想的步伐！, 我们要乘着新时代的浩荡东风，加满油，把稳舵，鼓足劲，让承载着13亿多中国人民伟大梦想的中华巨轮继续劈波斩浪、扬帆远航，胜利驶向充满希望的明天！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京3月20日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2018年03月21日 02 版）, ]",习近平在第十三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29879544
