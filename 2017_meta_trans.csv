0,4,"[, Dear Chancellor Merkel,, colleagues: 　　 Hamburg is known as the ""World Bridge City"". I am very happy to be here with you, to discuss building a bridge of cooperation, and to promote common prosperity. First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the warm and thoughtful reception of Prime Minister Merkel and Germany. , 　　 At present, the world economy is showing a good momentum. Relevant international organizations predict that the world economy is expected to grow by 3.5% this year. This is the best economic situation in recent years. Such a situation is inseparable from the efforts of the G20. At the same time, the deep-seated problems in the world economy have not been resolved, and they still face many unstable and uncertain factors. In the face of challenges, the Hangzhou Summit proposed the G20 plan: to build an innovative, dynamic, joint and inclusive world economy. The Hamburg Summit takes ""Shaping a Linked World"" as its theme, which is in line with the Hangzhou Summit. We must work together to turn these ideas into action. Here, I would like to make a few comments. , 　　 First, we must adhere to the general direction of building an open world economy. This is an important experience of the G20 in dealing with the international financial crisis and an important way to promote world economic growth. An important reason why international organizations are currently raising their expectations for world economic growth is that international trade is expected to grow by 2.4% and global investment by 5%. We must stick to the path of open development and mutual benefit and win-win results, and jointly make the world economy a bigger cake. As the world’s major economies, we should also be able to play a leading role, support the multilateral trading system, act in accordance with jointly formulated rules, and find win-win solutions to meet common challenges through consultation. , 　　 Second, we must work together to find new impetus for world economic growth. This motivation comes first from innovation. Research shows that 95% of the global industry and commerce are closely related to the Internet, and the world economy is undergoing a digital transformation. We must strengthen cooperation in the field of digital economy and new industrial revolution and jointly create new technologies, new industries, new models and new products. This motivation also comes from better solving development problems and implementing the 2030 sustainable development agenda. This is beneficial to developing countries and will also bring market and investment opportunities to developed countries. Everyone is a winner. The Hangzhou Summit reached an important consensus on innovation and development. The momentum of cooperation was continued in the German year. The next step is to continue to deepen and solidify. , 　　 Third, we must work together to make the world's economic growth more inclusive. At present, the development of the world economy is still uneven, and the challenges of technological advancement for employment are becoming increasingly prominent. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2020, artificial intelligence will replace more than 5 million jobs worldwide. An important mission of the G20 is to deal with the contradictions of fairness and efficiency, capital and labor, technology and employment in line with the concept of inclusive growth determined by the Hangzhou Summit. It is necessary to continue to combine economic policies and social policies organically to solve the challenges brought about by industrial upgrading and the mismatch of knowledge and skills to make income distribution more fair and reasonable. The G20 should pay more attention to exchanges and cooperation in education and training, employment and entrepreneurship, and distribution mechanisms. The completion of these tasks is also conducive to the healthy development of economic globalization. , 　　 Fourth, we must continue to improve global economic governance. Since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, the G20 has achieved positive results in strengthening macro-policy coordination, reforming international financial institutions, improving international financial supervision, and combating tax avoidance, and has made important contributions to stabilizing financial markets and promoting economic recovery. The next step is to continue our efforts in the above areas, especially to strengthen macro policy communication, prevent financial market risks, develop inclusive finance and green finance, and promote the financial industry to better serve the development of the real economy. , 　　 Not long ago, China successfully held the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum. In the spirit of consultation, co-construction and sharing, all parties to the meeting have achieved fruitful results in promoting policy communication, facility connectivity, trade flow, capital and financial connectivity, and people-to-people communication, and strive to create new governance concepts, new cooperation platforms, and new development momentum. This is highly consistent with the purpose of the G20. , 　　 German proverb says that one person’s effort is addition, and one team’s effort is multiplication. Let us work together to promote linked growth, promote common prosperity, and continue to move towards the goal of building a community of human destiny! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Hamburg, Germany, July 7th), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (July 08, 2017, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Adhere to Openness and Inclusion and Promote Linked Growth,1399,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-07-08,"[, 尊敬的默克尔总理，, 各位同事：, 　　汉堡被誉为“世界桥城”。很高兴同大家在这里相聚，共商架设合作之桥、促进共同繁荣大计。首先，我谨对默克尔总理及德方的热情周到接待，表示衷心感谢。, 　　当前，世界经济出现向好势头，有关国际组织预计，今年世界经济有望增长3.5%。这是近年来最好的经济形势。有这样的局面，同二十国集团的努力分不开。同时，世界经济中的深层次问题尚未解决，仍然面临诸多不稳定不确定因素。, 　　面对挑战，杭州峰会提出了二十国集团方案：建设创新、活力、联动、包容的世界经济。汉堡峰会把“塑造联动世界”作为主题，同杭州峰会一脉相承。我们要共同努力，把这些理念化为行动。这里，我愿谈几点意见。, 　　第一，我们要坚持建设开放型世界经济大方向。这是二十国集团应对国际金融危机的重要经验，也是推动世界经济增长的重要路径。国际组织当前调高世界经济增长预期，一个重要原因就是预计国际贸易增长2.4%、全球投资增加5%。我们要坚持走开放发展、互利共赢之路，共同做大世界经济的蛋糕。作为世界主要经济体，我们应该也能够发挥领导作用，支持多边贸易体制，按照共同制定的规则办事，通过协商为应对共同挑战找到共赢的解决方案。, 　　第二，我们要共同为世界经济增长发掘新动力。这个动力首先来自创新。研究表明，全球95%的工商业同互联网密切相关，世界经济正在向数字化转型。我们要在数字经济和新工业革命领域加强合作，共同打造新技术、新产业、新模式、新产品。这个动力也来自更好解决发展问题，落实2030年可持续发展议程。这对发展中国家有利，也将为发达国家带来市场和投资机遇，大家都是赢家。杭州峰会就创新和发展达成重要共识，有关合作势头在德国年得以延续，下一步要不断走深、走实。, 　　第三，我们要携手使世界经济增长更加包容。当前，世界经济发展仍不平衡，技术进步对就业的挑战日益突出。世界经济论坛预计，到2020年，人工智能将取代全球逾500万个工作岗位。二十国集团的一项重要使命，就是本着杭州峰会确定的包容增长理念，处理好公平和效率、资本和劳动、技术和就业的矛盾。要继续把经济政策和社会政策有机结合起来，解决产业升级、知识和技能错配带来的挑战，使收入分配更加公平合理。二十国集团应该更加重视在教育培训、就业创业、分配机制上交流合作。这些工作做好了，也有利于经济全球化健康发展。, 　　第四，我们要继续完善全球经济治理。国际金融危机爆发以来，二十国集团在加强宏观政策协调、改革国际金融机构、完善国际金融监管、打击避税等方面取得积极成果，为稳定金融市场、促进经济复苏作出了重要贡献。下一步，我们要在上述领域继续努力，特别是要加强宏观政策沟通，防范金融市场风险，发展普惠金融、绿色金融，推动金融业更好服务实体经济发展。, 　　不久前，中国成功举办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛。与会各方本着共商、共建、共享精神，在促进政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通上取得丰硕成果，努力打造治理新理念、合作新平台、发展新动力。这同二十国集团的宗旨高度契合。, 　　德国谚语说，一个人的努力是加法，一个团队的努力是乘法。让我们携手合作，推动联动增长，促进共同繁荣，不断向着构建人类命运共同体的目标迈进！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社德国汉堡7月7日电）, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年07月08日 02 版）, ]",习近平：坚持开放包容 推动联动增长,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29391615

On behalf of the Chinese government and people, on behalf of my wife, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to everyone at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation! , Many of the friends here are not new to Beijing, and have left many memories here. Beijing is the ancient capital of thousands of years and has witnessed the vicissitudes of history. Beijing is also a modern new city, with the development of China constantly showing new styles. Beijing is even more an international metropolis, where different civilizations from the east and the west meet and blend together from time to time. In Beijing, you can visit the ancient Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the Temple of Heaven, as well as visit the modernist Bird's Nest, Water Cube, and National Grand Theater. You can hear traditional Chinese opera and crosstalk, as well as appreciate ballet and symphony from the West. You will meet young Chinese who are trendy in clothes and walking through world-famous stores, and you can also meet foreign friends who speak fluent Chinese and wander in the old Hutong. , Watching the sea in a drop of water, looking at the world in a grain of sand. Beijing has become a cosmopolitan city from a small historical city, revealing the truth to us: human beings live in a common homeland and share a common destiny, and human history has always developed in the encounter and knowledge of different peoples and different cultures. . , More than 2000 years ago, our predecessors, with the simple desire of friendly exchanges, opened up the ancient Silk Road and opened the era of great exchanges in the history of human civilization. Today, we inherit the spirit of the ancient Silk Road and discuss the construction of the “Belt and Road”, which is the continuation of the historical trend and the right choice for the future. The construction of the “Belt and Road” bears our desire for civilization exchanges, will continue to serve as the messenger of civilization communication, promote various civilizations to learn from each other, and make human civilization more colorful. The construction of the “Belt and Road” bears our expectation for peace and tranquility, and will become a bond that brings closer relations between countries, allowing people of all countries to help each other, respect and trust each other, and jointly build a harmonious home and a peaceful world. The construction of the “Belt and Road” carries our pursuit of common development and will help countries break through development bottlenecks, narrow development gaps, share development achievements, and build a development community that connects suffering and common destiny. The construction of the “Belt and Road” carries our longing for a better life, and will consolidate the dreams of each country and common people into a common aspiration, let ideals become reality, and make people happy and healthy.

Tomorrow, we will hold a round table summit on the shore of Yanqi Lake and jointly plan the ""Belt and Road"" construction cooperation plan.

I believe that as long as we move towards each other, heart to heart, without retreating, without stopping, we can finally usher in the day when roads are connected, beautiful and common. I believe that our cause will be as old as the ancient Silk Road and will be descended from the future. , Now, I propose that everyone toast together to build a better future for the “Belt and Road”, to develop and prosper for all countries, for the success of this summit forum, for the health of guests and families, cheers!

3,36,"[, November 13, on the occasion of a state visit to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping published in Lao People’s Daily, Bat Liao Pao, and Vientiane Times the title “Building Together The signed article of China-Laos Strategic Destiny Community. The article is as follows:, Working together to build a strategically destiny community between China and Laos, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People’s Republic of China, at the invitation of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party and State Chairman Benyan Volaji, I am about to The People’s Democratic Republic conducts state visits. I have visited Laos twice. The warm and friendly Lao people, the magnificent Vientiane Pagoda Luang, and the beautiful Mekong River left a deep and beautiful impression on me. I look forward to having a friendly relationship with new and old friends in Laos, seeking common development, and forging a better future for bilateral relations. China and Laos are socialist friendships with similar ideals and beliefs, the same social system and similar development paths. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than half a century ago, the relations between the two parties and two countries have withstood the test of changes in the times and international changes, and they have written touching stories. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Kaishan Fengweihan and other leaders of the older generation of the two countries have taken a close look at each other, forming a profound fighting friendship and laying a solid foundation for the friendship between generations. The descendants of the important Laotian leader Guining Benchena have studied in China for many years. They have left a youthful footprint in China and have also become witnesses, inheritors and promoters of traditional friendship between China and Laos. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese military and civilians actively supported the cause of national independence and liberation of Laos. More than 200 Chinese martyrs stayed in this hot spot where they fought, building a monument of indelible friendship between China and Laos. In the new era, the friendship between China and Laos has been strengthened for a long time and a new vitality has been radiated. The comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries is constantly expanding. High-level exchanges have become increasingly close, inter-party exchanges have continued to deepen, and political mutual trust has become more stable. There is an old saying in China, ""Public friends are friends, and comrades are friends."" This is a true portrayal of China-Laos relations. As like-minded good neighbors, good friends, good comrades, and good partners, China and Laos are exploring socialist theory and practical innovation, comprehensively promoting economic, political, cultural, and social construction, and accelerating the process of modernization. ,Mutual support. China-Laos relations can be called a model of good-neighborly friendship and comprehensive cooperation between China and neighboring countries. , China-Laos development strategy integration has accelerated. The “Belt and Road” initiative proposed by China is highly compatible with Laos’ strategy of “changing the landlocked country into a landlocked country”, China’s “13th Five-Year Plan” and the “eighth five-year” plan for social development in Laos, and the development philosophy of the two countries is similar. Last year, the China-Laos Railway, the flagship project of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries, started construction on all lines, and the transportation artery carrying the development dream of the Lao people is gradually becoming a reality. The construction of the Mohan-Moding Economic Cooperation Zone and the Vientiane Seseta Comprehensive Development Zone has made gratifying progress. A number of enterprises and institutions have signed up to settle in, which will help Laos achieve industrial upgrading, attract foreign investment, promote employment, and promote the development of SMEs. , China-Laos pragmatic cooperation enters the fast lane. China has become the largest investor in Laos and the second largest trading partner. From January to September this year, the bilateral trade volume reached US$2.1 billion, a year-on-year increase of 25.1%. China's direct investment in Laos totaled more than US$6.1 billion, driving the development of local industries such as hydropower, minerals, and service trade. China has actively promoted the implementation of a number of livelihood assistance projects, such as hospitals, highways, and schools, to help the Lao people improve their living standards and quality. The Nanlek Hydropower Station, constructed by Chinese companies, is performing well and has played an important role in the economic construction and social development of Laos. Laos’ exports to China continue to expand, and agricultural products such as rice, coffee, bananas, and watermelons are increasingly popular with Chinese consumers. , Middle-aged and elderly cultural exchanges are increasingly active. In the first half of this year, 400,000 Chinese tourists went to Laos for sightseeing. More and more Lao people go to China to do business and travel, and the number of Lao students studying in China with Chinese government scholarship ranks first among ASEAN countries. China's ""Peace Train"" and ""Mekong Bright Travel"" medical service activities have won wide acclaim from the Lao people. Nearly 100 young volunteers in Shanghai, China have successively gone to Laos for network technology, physical education, etc. One of the volunteers has been the head coach of the Lao National Men's Basketball Team. The documentary ""The Story of Time"" co-produced by China and Laos has been broadcast on the Internet for millions of times, deeply shaking the hearts of the people of both countries. A rock song ""Belt and Road"" created and sung by Lao friends was popular on the Internet, and won a large number of netizens to like and comment. In the great journey of building socialism with its own characteristics, China and Laos ""have the same intentions and harmony"". Last month, the Communist Party of China successfully held the 19th National Congress. This conference formulated the overall policy and actions for the future development of the Chinese party and countryLast month, the Communist Party of China successfully convened the 19th National Congress. This conference formulated the overall policy and action plan for the future development of the Chinese party and the country. The conference draws on the grandeur of China’s construction and development from now to the middle of this century Blueprint. By 2020, a moderately prosperous society will be fully built; from 2020 to 2035, socialist modernization will be basically achieved; from 2035 to the middle of this century, China will be built into a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful socialist modern power. We have Ability and confidence to lead the Chinese people towards the Chinese dream of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Under the leadership of the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, the Lao society is harmonious and stable, the economy is booming, and the country is changing with each passing day. It is being determined by the Lao Party’s 10th National Congress The goal is to promote comprehensive innovation. The same mission and common dream, just like the Lancang-Mekong River running through the old and the old, firmly link our future and closely connect our destiny., ——We need to strengthen our strategy Communicate and build a community of shared destiny of mutual respect and trust. Both China and Laos must inherit and carry forward the friendly traditions of the two countries, firmly grasp the correct direction of the development of bilateral relations, deepen political mutual trust, learn from each other’s theory and practical experience of advancing reform and exploring socialist construction, Close contacts between political parties, governments, legislative bodies, and localities to expand the breadth and depth of China-Laos comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation. The two countries should continue to support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests and major concerns, and determine foreign policy based on the merits of the matter. To jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries., ——We must deepen strategic integration and build a community of mutual help and destiny. China supports Laos to take advantage of its unique location and achieve green and sustainable development. The China-Laos Railway is an important component of the Pan-Asian Railway Network Partly, it has great strategic and practical significance to Laos. The two sides should strengthen overall coordination and strive to complete the opening to traffic as soon as possible, so that Laos can communicate with neighboring countries and the world. We must promote the construction and operation of major projects such as economic cooperation zones, satellites, and hydropower stations. The Lao people benefit more and benefit early. ——We need to expand pragmatic cooperation to create a mutually beneficial community of destiny. China and Laos are linked by mountains and rivers, and their economies complement each other. Laos’ natural endowment is superior, its economy is developing rapidly, and it is advancing industrialization and modernization. The key stage of the process. China has rich experience and advantages in capital, technology, equipment, etc. Both sides should constantly explore cooperation potential, innovate cooperation models, expand pragmatic cooperation in the fields of power interconnection, finance, energy and other fields, and promote Laos’ agriculture and water conservancy. The construction of infrastructures such as transportation, communications, and communications has brought tangible benefits to the people of the two countries. ——We want to expand cultural exchanges and build a community of shared future with mutual learning. We must strengthen culture, science and technology, youth, localities, etc. Exchanges and cooperation in the field have allowed the friendship between China and Laos to spread. We welcome more Lao friends to study, travel and work in China and become messengers to inherit and carry forward the traditional friendship between China and Laos. China will actively support Laos in hosting the 2018 Tourism Year and encourage more Chinese tourists come to Laos for sightseeing and experience the unique charm of Laos' history and culture., Both China and Laos An important member of the Cangjiang-Mekong cooperation mechanism. Since the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism was officially launched in 2016, it has achieved fruitful results, reflecting the ""Lan-Mei Speed"" and ""Lan-Mei Efficiency"", and cultivated the Lan-Mei culture of treating each other as equals, sincerely helping each other, and being close to one family. Laos will serve as co-chair of the Lancang-Mekong cooperation next year. China is willing to work with Laos to promote the Lancang-Mekong cooperation to achieve more results, implement the early harvest projects proposed by the Laos, drive the development of the subregion, and bring more benefits to the people of the countries in the region. , Lao people often say that ""a wood stick can't burn into a fire, and a wooden stick can't be fenced.""

5,38,"[, People's Network Beijing, November 9th-On November 9th, on the eve of a state visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping published the title of ""Creating a New Situation in China-Vietnam Friendship"" in the Vietnam People's Daily Signed articles. The article is as follows: To create a new situation in China-Vietnam friendship, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping, at the invitation of General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Ruan Fuzhong and President Chen Daguang, I will soon pay a state visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. This is my warmth after I visited Vietnam again at the end of 2015. China and Vietnam are neighbors connected by mountains and rivers. The peoples of the two countries live next to each other, and there has been a mutual understanding since ancient times. Since modern times, in the struggle for national independence and national liberation, the two peoples fought side by side and supported each other, forming a special friendship of ""comrades plus brothers."" President Ho Chi Minh has been in China for 12 years before and after the revolution, and he has sympathy with Chinese leaders such as Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. The well-known Vietnamese general Flood actively participated in the Chinese revolution and participated in the Long March of the Red Army. He became the only foreign officer awarded by the New China and a rare ""two-state general"" in the world. The Chinese people have also provided selfless help to the struggle for the national liberation of Vietnam. Chairman Mao Zedong once stated that ""700 million Chinese people are a strong backing for the Vietnamese people, and the vast Chinese territory is a reliable rear for the Vietnamese people."" Dou Jinbo, the first artillery adviser of China’s military advisory group to Vietnam, named the newly born daughter “Yuehua” after receiving the task of helping Vietnamese comrades. Recalling the years, the friendship created by the older generations of the leaders of the two parties and two countries, and the friendship formed by the people of the two countries with blood, deserves to be remembered and cherished forever. Entering a new era, in advancing reform and innovation and the cause of socialist construction, the peoples of the two countries learn from each other and go hand in hand. We have jointly explored the path of socialist development in line with our national conditions, created their own development miracles, and also promoted the rapid development of relations between the two countries. Mutual political trust between the two countries is becoming stronger and higher-level exchanges are more frequent. My visit this time is the mutual visit of the highest leaders of the two parties and two countries after another lapse of two years. The pragmatic cooperation between the two countries has expanded in depth. China has maintained Vietnam's largest trading partner status for 13 consecutive years. Vietnam has become China's largest trading partner among ASEAN countries, with bilateral trade volume of nearly 100 billion US dollars in 2016. More and more Chinese companies are investing in Viet Nam. Rainbow Group has been operating in Vietnam for more than ten years. The factory built in Quang Ninh Province has created more than 7,000 jobs for the local area and is also a major taxpayer in the province. More than 30 companies have settled in the Longjiang Industrial Park established in Qianjiang by investors mainly Chinese private enterprises. The humanities exchanges between the two countries have become closer. China is the largest source of foreign tourists in Vietnam, and Chinese tourists can be seen everywhere in tourist cities such as Da Nang and Nha Trang. There are more than 300 passenger flights between the two countries every week. Chinese classics such as ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" and ""Water Margin"" are highly respected in Vietnam, and contemporary film and television works are also popular among Vietnamese people. Vietnamese singer Du Shiqinghua also won the monthly championship on China Central Television's ""Star Walk"". Even more commendable is that the two countries have resolved the demarcation of the land and the Beibu Gulf through friendly consultations, properly handled and managed their differences, and created favorable conditions for the common development of the two countries and regional peace and stability. These are the best interpretations of the spiritual core and rich connotation of the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation between China and Vietnam. At present, both countries are embarking on a new journey of reform and development, and are advancing bravely towards their respective grand goals. Last month, the Communist Party of China successfully held the 19th National Congress. This conference formulated the overall policy and action plan for the future development of the Chinese party and country. The conference drew a grand blueprint for China's construction and development from now to the middle of this century. By 2020, a moderately prosperous society will be fully built; from 2020 to 2035, socialist modernization will be basically realized; from 2035 to the middle of this century, China will be built into a strong, powerful, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful socialist modern power. We are capable and confident to lead the Chinese people towards the Chinese dream of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Vietnam is also in accordance with the guidelines established by the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, comprehensively promoting the cause of innovation, and moving towards the goal of building a modern industrial country that is rich, powerful, democratic, fair, and civilized. More than ever, we need to work together to pursue the dream of strengthening the country and enriching the people. At present, the international and regional situation is changing, and the two parties and two countries of China and Vietnam are facing many new issues and challenges that are the same or similar. As the Chinese saying goes, ""difficulties and hardships make you better."" There’s a saying in Vietnam, “No one sees the waves high, let go of the paddleThe same or similar new problems and new challenges. As the Chinese saying goes, ""difficulties and hardships make you better."" There is a saying in Vietnam, ""You can't see the high waves, put down your paddles."" As good neighbors, good friends, good comrades, and good partners with related futures and common destiny, we must maintain and develop good relations between the two countries, provide assistance for maintaining stability, deepening reform, and improving people's livelihood, and jointly promote the cause of socialism and promote the region. Peaceful, stable and open development. I would like to share a few thoughts on this. , ——To stabilize the direction and seek a new height of strategic mutual trust. We need to maintain regular high-level contacts, exchange views on the relations between the two parties and two countries and issues of common interest in a timely manner, and steer China-Vietnam relations. Actively carry out the exchange of experience in governing and rejuvenating the country, strengthen inter-party exchanges, jointly enrich and develop the theory and practice of socialist construction, and create a community of destiny with strategic significance. , ——Deepen cooperation and build a new pattern of interest integration. We will continue to closely link the development strategies of the two countries, jointly promote the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" and ""two corridors and one circle"", and promote substantial progress in cooperation in key areas such as infrastructure construction, economic and trade, production capacity, cross-border economic cooperation zones, and agriculture. To bring more benefits to the people of the two countries. , ——Expand exchanges and build a new foundation for people's blind date. We must carry forward the traditional friendship, promote cultural and cultural exchanges, close cooperation in culture, education, tourism, youth, media, etc., tell Chinese stories and Vietnamese stories, so that the friendship between China and Vietnam will take root in the hearts of the people and spread from generation to generation. , ——Strengthen coordination and create new highlights of multilateral cooperation. We must grasp the general trend of the world and the trend of the times, strengthen coordination and cooperation within the multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, APEC, China-ASEAN, and Lancang-Mekong cooperation, to jointly lead open and inclusive regional cooperation, and maintain the momentum of regional open development. , ——Look at the big picture and continue writing a new chapter of friendship and good neighborliness We must proceed from the respective reform and development and stability and the overall situation of Sino-Vietnamese friendship, manage contradictions and differences, adhere to friendly consultations, and seek a basic and long-term solution to the maritime issue acceptable to both parties. We must fully and effectively implement the ""Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea"", actively promote the ""South China Sea Code of Conduct"" consultations, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability of the South China Sea. , Another important agenda for my visit is to attend the 25th APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting in Da Nang. China supports the Vietnamese side to hold this conference well and is willing to work with the Vietnamese side and other members to deepen regional economic integration, build the Asia-Pacific free trade zone and strengthen regional interconnection under the theme of ""Building a New Momentum and Creating a Shared Future"" Promote economic structure reform and innovation, promote inclusive development, plan for a post-2020 cooperation vision, and carry out practical discussions to achieve positive results and make positive contributions to promoting the common development and prosperity of Asia-Pacific. , President Ho Chi Minh called Vietnam's relationship with China ""like hands and feet, like pestle and mortar, like roots and stems, like brother and brother."" There is an old saying in China, ""Brothers are one heart, and their profits are determined by gold."" Through this visit, I look forward to in-depth exchanges with Vietnamese leaders and friends from all walks of life, to tap the potential for cooperation, to build friendly friendship, to deepen the special friendship between the two countries, and to jointly create a new situation in China-Vietnam relations. , ""People's Daily"" (November 10, 2017, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in the Vietnamese media to create a new situation in China-Vietnam friendship,2481,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-11-10,"[, 人民网北京11月9日电 11月9日，在对越南社会主义共和国进行国事访问前夕，中共中央总书记、国家主席习近平在越南《人民报》发表题为《开创中越友好新局面》的署名文章。文章如下：, 开创中越友好新局面, 中共中央总书记、中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 应越共中央总书记阮富仲和国家主席陈大光邀请，我即将对越南社会主义共和国进行国事访问。这是我在2015年年底访问越南后，再次踏上这片美丽的土地，感到十分亲切。, 中越是山水相连、唇齿相依的邻邦。两国人民毗邻而居，自古便有互通互鉴之情。, 近代以来，在争取国家独立和民族解放的斗争中，两国人民并肩战斗、彼此支援，结下了“同志加兄弟”的特殊情谊。胡志明主席在中国开展革命的时间前后长达12年，同毛泽东主席、周恩来总理等中国领导人情同手足。越南著名将领洪水积极投身中国革命，参加红军25000里长征，成为新中国授衔的唯一一位外籍军官，也是世界上少有的“两国将军”。中国人民也为越南民族解放斗争提供无私帮助，毛泽东主席曾表示“7亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方”。中国赴越南军事顾问团首任炮兵顾问窦金波，在接到帮助越南同志的任务后，将刚降生的女儿起名为“越华”。忆峥嵘岁月，两党两国老一辈领导人亲手缔造、两国人民用鲜血凝成的情谊值得我们永远铭记和珍惜。, 进入新时期，在推进改革和革新以及社会主义建设事业中，两国人民相互借鉴、携手并进。我们共同探索符合本国国情的社会主义发展道路，创造出各自的发展奇迹，也推动两国关系得到长足发展。两国政治互信日益牢固，高层往来更加频密。我这次访问是两党两国最高领导人时隔两年后再度实现年内互访。两国务实合作深入拓展。中国连续13年保持越南第一大贸易伙伴地位，越南成为东盟国家中中国最大贸易伙伴，2016年双边贸易额近1000亿美元。越来越多的中国企业到越南投资兴业。天虹集团在越南经营十几年，在广宁省兴建的工厂为当地创造了7000多个就业岗位，也是省内纳税大户。以中国民营企业为主的投资商在前江省创建的龙江工业园，已有30多家企业入驻。两国人文交流更加密切。中国是越南第一大外国游客来源地，岘港、芽庄等旅游城市随处可见中国游客。每周往返于两国之间的客运航班有300多趟。中国的《三国演义》《水浒传》等经典名著在越南备受推崇，当代影视作品也深受越南民众喜爱。越南歌手杜氏清花还在中国中央电视台《星光大道》节目中获得月度冠军。更难能可贵的是，两国通过友好协商解决了陆地和北部湾划界问题，妥善处理并管控分歧，为两国共同发展和地区和平稳定创造了有利条件。这些都是对中越全面战略合作伙伴关系精神内核和丰富内涵的最好诠释。, 当前，两国都走在改革发展的新征程上，朝着各自的宏伟目标奋勇前进。上个月，中国共产党成功召开第十九次全国代表大会。这次大会制定了中国党和国家未来发展的总体方针和行动纲领。大会绘制了从现在到本世纪中叶中国建设发展的宏伟蓝图。到2020年，将全面建成小康社会；从2020年到2035年，基本实现社会主义现代化；从2035年到本世纪中叶，把中国建设成为富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国。我们有能力、有信心带领中国人民朝着实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦迈进。越南也正按照越共十二大确定的方针，全面推进革新事业，朝着早日建成民富国强、民主、公平、文明的现代化工业国目标迈进。我们比以往任何时候都需要携手合作，共同追寻强国富民梦。, 当前，国际和地区形势风云变幻，中越两党两国面临许多相同或相似的新问题新挑战。中国俗语称，“艰难困苦，玉汝于成”。越南有句俗语，“莫见浪头高，放下手中桨”。作为前途相关、命运与共的好邻居、好朋友、好同志、好伙伴，我们要维护和发展好两国关系，为各自维护稳定、深化改革、改善民生提供助力，共同推进社会主义事业，促进地区和平稳定和开放发展。我愿就此分享几点想法。, ——把稳方向，谋求战略互信新高度。我们要保持高层经常接触，及时就两党两国关系及共同关心的问题交换意见，为中越关系掌好舵。积极开展执政兴国经验交流，加强党际交往，共同丰富和发展社会主义建设理论和实践，打造具有战略意义的命运共同体。, ——深化合作，构建利益融合新格局。我们要继续把两国发展战略紧密对接起来，共同推进“一带一路”和“两廊一圈”建设，推动基础设施建设、经贸、产能、跨境经济合作区、农业等重点领域合作取得实质进展，给两国人民带来更多实惠。, ——扩大交流，筑就民心相亲新基础。我们要把传统友谊发扬光大，促进人文交流，密切文化、教育、旅游、青年、媒体等合作，讲好中国故事和越南故事，让中越友好扎根人民心间、代代薪火相传。, ——加强协调，打造多边合作新亮点。我们要把握世界大势和时代潮流，加强在联合国、亚太经合组织、中国—东盟、澜沧江—湄公河合作等多边框架内的协调和配合，共同引领开放包容的区域合作，维护地区开放发展势头。, ——着眼大局，续写敦亲睦邻新篇章。我们要从各自改革发展稳定和中越友好大局出发，管控矛盾分歧，坚持友好协商，寻求双方均能接受的海上问题基本和长久解决办法。我们要全面有效落实《南海各方行为宣言》，积极推进“南海行为准则”磋商，共同维护南海和平稳定。, 我这次访问还有一个重要日程，就是出席在岘港举行的亚太经合组织第二十五次领导人非正式会议。中方支持越方办好这次会议，愿同越方和其他成员一道，在“打造全新动力，开创共享未来”的主题下，就深化区域经济一体化、建设亚太自由贸易区、加强地区互联互通、推进经济结构改革创新、促进包容性发展、规划2020年后合作愿景等方面开展务实讨论，取得积极成果，为推动亚太共同发展繁荣作出积极贡献。, 胡志明主席称越南同中国的关系“如手和足，如杵和臼，如根和茎，如兄和弟”。中国有句古话，“兄弟同心，其利断金”。我期待通过这次访问，同越南领导人以及各界朋友深入交流，共挖合作潜力，厚植友好情谊，深化两国特殊友好，携手开创中越关系新局面。, 《 人民日报 》（ 2017年11月10日 01 版）, ]",习近平在越南媒体发表署名文章 开创中越友好新局面,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29637604
6,39,"[, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, friends: Good morning! Now, I announce the beginning of the dialogue between emerging market countries and developing countries. , Warmly welcome everyone to attend the dialogue between emerging market countries and developing countries. During the leaders' meeting, the BRICS countries focused on communicating with other emerging market countries and developing countries. China has made innovations this year and invited representative countries from different regions to participate in today's dialogue. I believe this dialogue will help strengthen solidarity and cooperation between emerging market countries and developing countries, as well as the BRICS' own development. , Today, it is very rare for everyone to get together. Many colleagues came from afar, and some have adjusted their schedules specifically for attending the dialogue, and I am grateful for this. I look forward to working with you on the theme of ""Deepening Mutually Beneficial Cooperation and Promoting Common Development"" to discuss development cooperation plans and inject strong momentum into deepening South-South cooperation and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Since the beginning of the new century, the collective rise of emerging market countries and developing countries has become an irreversible trend of the times. In recent years, the contribution rate of these countries to world economic growth has been steadily high, reaching 80% in 2016, and is the well-deserved main engine. Recently, the world economy is showing signs of improvement, international trade and investment are picking up, a new round of technology and industrial revolution is poised to take off, and new industries, new technologies, and new business forms are emerging in endlessly. In this sense, emerging market countries and developing countries face rare development opportunities. At the same time, we must also see that the downside risks and uncertainties of the world economy are rising simultaneously, multilateral trade negotiations are struggling, and the implementation of the Paris Agreement has encountered resistance. In some countries, the tendency of internal supervision has increased, and the willingness to participate in international development cooperation has declined. The spillover effect of policy adjustment is still fermenting. The world economy has entered a critical period of accelerating the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. The game between the parties around interests and rules is becoming increasingly fierce. The external environment of emerging market countries and developing countries is more complicated and grim. , Sailing against the current, retreating if not advancing. Facing the new situation, emerging market countries and developing countries need to work together to strengthen their confidence, join hands in creating a favorable development environment, strive to achieve greater development, and make greater contributions to world economic growth. (1) Strengthen unity and cooperation and jointly build an open world economy. In today's era, all countries are interdependent and integrated communities of interests. Openness, tolerance, and win-win cooperation are the only correct choices. Enthusiastic neighbors and zero-sum games will not help world economic growth. Emerging market countries and developing countries will be the first victims. We must advocate for an open world economy, firmly support the multilateral trading system, oppose protectionism, and guide economic globalization to achieve an inclusive and inclusive rebalancing. It is necessary to strengthen the coordination of positions, promote positive results of the 11th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, promote the remaining issues of the Doha Development Round, and clarify the direction for the development of the multilateral trading system. Efforts should be made to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries in global economic governance, and promote the formation of a more just and reasonable international economic order. (2) Strengthen solidarity and cooperation to jointly implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Development is the first priority of emerging market countries and developing countries. Based on our own national conditions, we must effectively link the sustainable development agenda with our national development strategies, promote it persistently, and explore a road of sustainable development in which economic, social, and environmental coordination goes hand in hand. We must call on the international community to place development at an important position in macro policy coordination, play the role of the United Nations, make good use of the high-level political forum on sustainable development, and accelerate the implementation of the sustainable development agenda. It is necessary to urge developed countries to keep their promises and increase their support for developing countries in accordance with the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities. Recently, the United Nations development system is brewing reforms. We must promote reforms to focus on development, increase investment, and truly serve the needs of developing countries. (3) Strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and jointly grasp the historical opportunities of world economic restructuring. The new round of technology and industrial revolution has spawned new momentum for development, and has also brought rare development opportunities. Seizing this opportunity, emerging market countries and developing countries may achieve ""overtaking in corners"". Without this opportunity, the North-South divide and the imbalance in development will further expand. Therefore, we must have the courage to innovate and dare to reform, drastically advance the adjustment of the economic structure, and tap the endogenous driving force for development. At the same time, it is necessary to solve the problem of underpinning social policies and pay attention to ensuring and improving people's livelihood. We should focus on infrastructure construction, science and technology, education, industry and other fields, strengthen development strategy docking, experience exchange, and capacity building cooperation to help each other's economic development. (4) Strengthen solidarity and cooperationFocus on the field, strengthen development strategy docking, experience exchange, and capacity building cooperation to help each other's economic development. (4) Strengthen unity and cooperation and jointly build a wide range of development partnerships. A flower is not spring, so lone geese are difficult to travel. Emerging market countries and developing countries face similar development tasks, deepen pragmatic cooperation, and give play to complementary advantages, which can produce a positive effect of ""one plus one is greater than two."" We must make good use of the BRICS and the Group of 77 and other mechanisms to carry out South-South cooperation in a wider and wider field, work together to meet various global challenges, cultivate a joint development chain, and achieve joint self-reliance. This year, China invited representative developing countries to attend this dialogue, the purpose of which is to build a network of partners and a development community and a community of shared destiny among nations. , Colleagues! , China attaches great importance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, has formulated country-level plans to implement the agenda, established sustainable development innovation demonstration zones, and achieved many early gains in the economic, social, and environmental fields. To promote international development cooperation, China will use the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund, China-United Nations Peace and Development Fund, Climate Change South-South Cooperation Fund and other mechanisms to actively help other developing countries implement the sustainable development agenda. , I would like to take this opportunity to announce that China will provide $500 million in aid under the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund to help other developing countries cope with the challenges of famine, refugees, climate change, and public health. China will also use platforms such as the International Development Knowledge Center and the South-South Cooperation and Development Institute to strengthen development experience exchange and capacity-building cooperation with other countries and provide 40,000 training places for other developing countries to China in the coming year. 4 years ago, I proposed the initiative to jointly build the “Belt and Road” initiative, which received a warm response from the international community. In May this year, China successfully hosted the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum, worked with relevant countries and international organizations to outline the “Belt and Road” construction cooperation vision, and proposed a series of pragmatic measures to support the sustainable development of countries along the Belt and Road. All parties believe that the concept and direction of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative, including policy communication, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, capital and financial connectivity, and people’s hearts, are highly compatible with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are fully capable of strengthening docking and mutual promotion . ""The Belt and Road Initiative"" is a road to cooperation, but also a road to hope and a win-win situation. China will combine the achievements of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum and cooperate with relevant countries in the areas of infrastructure interconnection, capacity cooperation, technological innovation and other fields. The ancient Chinese said: ""Is it easy to do things in the world? For those who are difficult, it is easy to carry on; if not, it is easy to be easy."" Emerging market countries and developing countries represent the future of world development. It is our due responsibility to promote international development cooperation and implement the sustainable development agenda. Let us join hands to open up a fair, open, comprehensive and innovative development path. , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, September 5th), ""People's Daily"" (September 06, 2017, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and promote common development,2467,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-09-06,"[, 各位同事，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　上午好！现在，我宣布新兴市场国家与发展中国家对话会开始。, 　　热烈欢迎大家出席新兴市场国家与发展中国家对话会。金砖国家在领导人会晤期间，注重同其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家进行沟通交流。中方今年有所创新，邀请了来自不同地区有代表性的国家出席今天的对话会，相信这种对话有利于新兴市场国家和发展中国家加强团结合作，有利于金砖机制自身发展。, 　　今天，大家能够聚到一起非常难得。很多同事是远道而来，有的还专门为出席对话会调整了日程安排，我对此表示感谢。我期待同大家围绕“深化互利合作，促进共同发展”的主题，共商发展合作大计，为深化南南合作、落实2030年可持续发展议程注入强劲动力。, 　　进入新世纪以来，新兴市场国家和发展中国家群体性崛起，成为不可逆转的时代潮流。近几年，这些国家对世界经济增长的贡献率稳居高位，2016年达到80%，是当之无愧的主引擎。近期，世界经济呈现向好态势，国际贸易和投资回升，新一轮科技和工业革命蓄势待发，新产业、新技术、新业态层出不穷。从这个意义上讲，新兴市场国家和发展中国家面临难得的发展机遇。, 　　同时，我们也要看到，世界经济下行风险和不确定性在同步上升，多边贸易谈判举步维艰，《巴黎协定》落实遭遇阻力。部分国家内顾倾向加重，参与国际发展合作意愿减退，其政策调整的外溢效应仍在发酵。世界经济进入新旧动能加速转换的关键期，各方围绕利益、规则的博弈日益激烈，新兴市场国家和发展中国家所处的外部环境更加复杂严峻。, 　　逆水行舟，不进则退。面对新的形势，新兴市场国家和发展中国家需要同舟共济，坚定信心，联手营造有利发展环境，努力实现更大发展，为世界经济增长作出更大贡献。, 　　（一）加强团结协作，共同构建开放型世界经济。当今时代，各国是相互依存、彼此融合的利益共同体，开放包容、合作共赢是唯一正确的选择。搞以邻为壑、零和游戏无助于世界经济增长，新兴市场国家和发展中国家将是首当其冲的受害者。我们要为开放型世界经济鼓与呼，坚定支持多边贸易体制，反对保护主义，引导经济全球化实现包容、普惠的再平衡。要加强立场协调，推动世界贸易组织第十一届部长级会议取得积极成果，推进多哈发展回合剩余议题，并为多边贸易体制发展明确方向。要努力提升新兴市场国家和发展中国家在全球经济治理中的代表性和发言权，推动形成更加公正合理的国际经济秩序。, 　　（二）加强团结协作，共同落实2030年可持续发展议程。发展是新兴市场国家和发展中国家的第一要务。我们要立足自身国情，把可持续发展议程同本国发展战略有效对接，持之以恒加以推进，探索出一条经济、社会、环境协调并进的可持续发展之路。要呼吁国际社会把发展置于宏观政策协调的重要位置，发挥联合国作用，利用好可持续发展高级别政治论坛，加快落实可持续发展议程。要敦促发达国家信守承诺，根据共同但有区别的责任等原则，增加对发展中国家支持力度。近期，联合国发展系统酝酿改革，我们要推动改革聚焦发展，增加投入，真正服务广大发展中国家需要。, 　　（三）加强团结协作，共同把握世界经济结构调整的历史机遇。新一轮科技和工业革命催生新的发展动能，也带来千载难逢的发展机遇。抓住这个机遇，新兴市场国家和发展中国家就可能实现“弯道超车”。失去这个机遇，南北鸿沟、发展失衡将进一步扩大。因此，我们必须勇于创新、敢于改革，大刀阔斧推进经济结构调整，挖掘发展内生动力。同时，要解决好社会政策托底问题，重视保障和改善民生。我们应该相互以基础设施建设、科技、教育、工业等领域为重点，加强发展战略对接、经验交流、能力建设合作，助力彼此经济发展。, 　　（四）加强团结协作，共同建设广泛的发展伙伴关系。一花不是春，孤雁难成行。新兴市场国家和发展中国家面临相似的发展任务，深化务实合作，发挥互补优势，能产生“一加一大于二”的积极效应。我们要利用好金砖国家、七十七国集团等机制，在更大范围、更广领域开展南南合作，携手应对各种全球性挑战，培育联动发展链条，实现联合自强。今年，中方邀请有代表性的发展中国家出席这次对话会，目的就在于构建伙伴网络，建设各国发展共同体、命运共同体。, 　　各位同事！, 　　中国高度重视2030年可持续发展议程，制定了落实议程的国别方案，建立了可持续发展创新示范区，在经济、社会、环境等领域取得多项早期收获。为推动国际发展合作，中方将利用南南合作援助基金、中国—联合国和平与发展基金、气候变化南南合作基金等机制，积极助力其他发展中国家落实可持续发展议程。, 　　我愿借此机会宣布，中国将在南南合作援助基金项下提供5亿美元援助，帮助其他发展中国家应对饥荒、难民、气候变化、公共卫生等挑战。中方还将利用国际发展知识中心、南南合作与发展学院等平台，同各国加强发展经验交流和能力建设合作，并在未来1年为其他发展中国家提供4万个来华培训名额。, 　　4年前，我提出共建“一带一路”倡议，得到国际社会热烈响应。今年5月，中国成功主办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，同有关国家和国际组织一道勾画“一带一路”建设合作愿景，提出一系列支持沿线国家可持续发展的务实举措。各方都认为，共建“一带一路”倡议的理念和方向，包括政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通，同2030年可持续发展议程高度契合，完全能够加强对接，相互促进。, 　　“一带一路”是一条合作之路，更是一条希望之路、共赢之路。中方将结合“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛成果落实，同有关国家在基础设施互联互通、产能合作、科技创新等领域开展合作。, 　　中国古人说：“天下事有难易乎？为之，则难者亦易矣；不为，则易者亦难矣。”新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表着世界发展的未来。促进国际发展合作、落实可持续发展议程是我们应有的担当。让我们携起手来，一起开辟一条公平、开放、全面、创新的发展之路。, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社厦门9月5日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年09月06日 03 版）, ]",习近平：深化互利合作 促进共同发展,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29517446
7,40,"[, journalist friends, ladies and gentlemen: Good afternoon! It is a pleasure to meet you and introduce you to the BRICS leaders' meeting and the dialogue between emerging market countries and developing countries. , Yesterday, the meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries in Xiamen ended successfully. The leaders of our five countries exchanged in-depth views on the current international situation, global governance, and BRICS cooperation, and reached broad consensus on the theme of ""deepening the BRICS partnership and opening up a brighter future."" The Xiamen meeting adopted the ""Brazil Declaration of Leaders of BRICS Countries"", reaffirming the BRICS spirit of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, comprehensively summarizing the successful experience of BRICS cooperation in the past 10 years, in order to strengthen the BRICS partnership and deepen practical cooperation in various fields A new blueprint was planned. During the meeting, China held a dialogue meeting between emerging market countries and developing countries. The leaders of the BRICS countries, Egypt, Mexico, Thailand, Tajikistan and Guinea were invited to attend. Leaders of various countries combined the theme of the ""Deepening Mutually Beneficial Cooperation and Promoting Common Development"" theme, discussed international development cooperation plans, and agreed to establish a wide range of development partnerships, accelerate the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda, and promote common development of all countries. 10 years ago, the BRIC cooperation emerged at a time when the world pattern was profoundly adjusted and reformed, which aroused great concern from the international community. Tested by major challenges such as the international financial crisis, the BRICS countries have explored a new path for unity, cooperation and mutual benefit between emerging market countries and developing countries. Leaders of various countries are determined to take the Xiamen meeting as a new starting point, strengthen their convictions, and make persistent efforts to jointly build a closer, broader, and more comprehensive strategic partnership and create the second ""Golden Decade"" of BRICS cooperation. The leaders of our five countries believe that the world today is undergoing profound and complex changes, and the prospects for world economic growth are improving, but various global challenges are emerging. The BRICS countries are all countries with important influence. They should deepen communication and coordination on major issues and promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable international order; they should play a constructive role, defend the basic norms of international relations, and safeguard international fairness and justice; they should cooperate Respond to various global challenges, promote open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win economic globalization, accelerate global economic governance reform, increase the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries, and create a good externality for the development of all countries surroundings. The leaders of our five countries believe that pragmatic cooperation is the foundation of BRICS cooperation, and that deep roots can only be luxuriant. Based on the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results, we should strengthen macro-policy coordination, connect development strategies, and comprehensively deepen cooperation in various fields such as economy, trade, finance, industry, and sustainable development to form a joint development pattern. This year, the BRICS has made new progress in pragmatic cooperation, and the gold content has been further improved. We have planned a cooperation roadmap in the areas of trade facilitation, service trade, currency swap, local currency settlement, government and social capital cooperation, established the New Development Bank Africa Regional Center, and formulated the BRICS Innovation Cooperation Action Plan. After a year of work, the BRICS countries have taken new steps towards the goals of a large market for trade and investment, a large circulation of money and finance, and a major infrastructure connection. We all emphasize that we must pay more attention to the role of innovation, seize the historical opportunities of the new industrial revolution, accelerate the optimization of the economic structure, and jointly achieve higher quality, more resilient and more sustainable growth. Our leaders of the five countries believe that deepening political and security cooperation and enhancing strategic mutual trust are in line with the common interests of the five countries and the expectations of the international community. Since this year, we have exchanged in-depth views on the international situation, global governance, international and regional hotspots, national security and development, and reached important consensus. We successfully held a meeting of high-level representatives of security affairs and the first formal meeting of foreign ministers this year, which injected new impetus into deepening BRICS political and security cooperation. We have established a regular consultation mechanism with permanent representatives in New York, Geneva, and Vienna to coordinate positions on major issues of common concern. Our cooperation in the areas of anti-terrorism, cybersecurity, peacekeeping, and Middle East issues has advanced smoothly. These have increased the influence of the BRICS countries. We support the continuation of good momentum in political and security cooperation, play our due role, and make greater contributions to maintaining global peace and stability. Our leaders of the five countries believe that the five countries have a long history and splendid culture. This is our precious wealth and should be cherished. This year, the humanities exchanges and cooperation between the five countries have been fully rolled out. The games, film festivals, cultural festivals, high-level meetings of traditional medicine and other activities are vivid and colorful, and are warmly welcomed by the people of the five countries. We actively carry out cooperation between parliaments, political parties, think tanks, youth, and localities to build a platform for people from all fields to participate in BRICS cooperation. We support the regularization and institutionalization of humanities exchange activities to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the five countriesPeople from various fields participated in the BRICS cooperation to build a platform. We support the regularization and institutionalization of humanities exchange activities, deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the five countries, and let the concept of partnership take root in the hearts of the people. During the meeting, the leaders of the five countries all felt that as the BRICS cooperation entered its second decade, the BRICS mechanism building needs to keep pace with the times and provide a solid guarantee for deepening cooperation in various fields. We all support strengthening the function of the coordinator, regularly reviewing the progress of the meeting's achievements, exploring new ways and ways of BRICS cooperation, and tightening the links. This year, new progress has been made in the construction of the BRICS mechanism. In addition to the mechanism for the first formal meeting of foreign ministers mentioned above and the regular consultation mechanism with permanent representatives to the United Nations, we have also promoted the establishment of cooperation platforms such as an electronic port demonstration network, e-commerce working group, museum alliance, art museum alliance, and library alliance. These new mechanisms will surely provide a powerful guarantee for our five countries to deepen cooperation in the political, economic and cultural fields. Next year, South Africa will assume the presidency of the BRICS countries and will hold the tenth meeting of leaders in Johannesburg. We believe that next year's meeting will surely achieve fruitful results. China is willing to work with all parties to fully support the Southern Conference and work together to push forward the BRICS cooperation. , Ladies and gentlemen! It is the fine tradition of the BRICS countries to carry out dialogue and cooperation with other emerging market countries and developing countries, and it has even greater significance in the current situation. The dialogue between emerging market countries and developing countries hosted by China has sent a strong signal to deepen South-South cooperation and global development cooperation.

8,41,"[, Dear President Zuma, Dear President Temer, Dear President Putin, Dear Prime Minister Modi, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends: Nice to meet you colleagues again. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to extend a warm welcome to everyone attending the meeting of leaders of the BRICS countries in Xiamen. I look forward to working with my colleagues to review and summarize the BRICS cooperation, draw a blueprint for future development, and start a new voyage of cooperation around the theme of the meeting, ""Deepening BRICS Partnership and Opening a Brighter Future."" , BRICS cooperation has gone through a glorious course of 10 years. Although our five countries are separated by mountains and seas, they came together with the common goal of cooperation and win-win. , The ancient Chinese said: ""It's the right thing to do. It's the same for thousands of miles. It is solid in glue paint and firm in gold stone."" The key to the rapid development of BRICS cooperation is to find the right way for cooperation. This is mutual respect and mutual assistance, taking a development path that suits the national conditions of the country; adhering to the spirit of openness, tolerance and win-win cooperation, and advancing economic, political, and cultural cooperation; advocating international fairness and justice, and working together with other emerging market countries and developing countries. Create a good external environment. Facts have proved that the BRICS cooperation meets the common needs of the development of our five countries and conforms to the historical trend. Although our five countries have different national conditions, our pursuit of partnership and prosperity and development are common, which allows us to transcend differences and differences and strive to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. At present, many profound and complex changes have taken place in the world pattern. In this context, BRICS cooperation is even more important. The people of the five countries hope that we will work together to promote development and improve people's well-being. The international community expects us to maintain world peace and promote common development. We should make persistent efforts to comprehensively deepen the BRICS partnership and start the second ""Golden Decade"" of BRICS cooperation. , First, commit to promoting pragmatic economic cooperation. Pragmatic cooperation is the foundation of BRICS cooperation, and we have made great achievements in this regard. At the same time, we must also see that the potential of BRICS cooperation has not yet been fully released. According to statistics, in 2016, BRICS countries invested US$197 billion in foreign investment, and only 5.7% occurred among our five countries. This shows that our five countries still have broad space for cooperation. Therefore, we should focus on the main line of pragmatic economic cooperation, and expand the points of interest in trade and investment, currency and finance, interconnection, sustainable development, innovation and industrial cooperation. This year, we formulated the ""BRICS Roadmap for Service Trade Cooperation"", ""BRICS Countries Investment Facilitation Program"", ""BRICS Countries Electronic Commerce Cooperation Initiative"", ""BRICS Countries Innovation Cooperation Action Plan"", ""BRICS Countries"" Action Plan for Deepening Cooperation in the Industrial Field, the establishment of the New Development Bank Africa Regional Center, and the decision to establish a BRICS model electronic port network, in taxation, e-commerce, local currency bonds, government and social capital cooperation, financial institutions and service network layout, etc. A positive consensus has been reached, pragmatic cooperation in various fields has been continuously institutionalized and solidified, and the gold content has been continuously improved. , I would like to take this opportunity to announce that China will set up the first phase of 500 million yuan of BRICS economic and technological cooperation and exchange plan to strengthen policy exchanges and pragmatic cooperation in economic and trade fields. Invested US$4 million in the New Development Bank Project Preparation Fund to support banking business operations and long-term development. We are willing to work with all parties to implement the past achievements and consensus, let the existing mechanism work well, jointly grasp the historical opportunities brought by the new industrial revolution, actively explore new areas and new ways of pragmatic cooperation, and tighten the links and let the gold The brick cooperation mechanism is stable and far-reaching. , Second, we are committed to strengthening the connection of development strategies. Although our five countries have different national conditions, they are at similar stages of development and have the same development goals. They have all entered a period of economic climb. Strengthening the connection of development strategies and giving play to their respective comparative advantages in resources, markets, and labor will stimulate the growth potential of our five countries and the creativity of the 3 billion people, and open up huge room for development. , We should plan on the big picture and make key decisions. Based on the principles of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, we should find the matching points of development policies and priority areas, and continue to target the big market of trade and investment, big circulation of money and finance, and big infrastructure. March forward. It is necessary to start from the perspective of structural reform and sustainable development, expand interest gathering points in the fields of innovation and entrepreneurship, industrial production capacity and other fields, exchange and share experience, and help each other's economic development. Deal with the relationship between growth rate, quality, and efficiency, and take the opportunity of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to seek the harmonization of economic, social, and environmental benefits, and achieve joint and inclusive development. Third, we are committed to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. As our five nations are closer to the world, objectiveInclusive development. Third, we are committed to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction. As our five nations have closer ties with the world, we objectively require us to actively participate in global governance. Without the participation of our five countries, many major and pressing global issues are difficult to resolve effectively. Our joint voice on issues related to international peace and development, and joint proposals, not only meet the expectations of the international community, but also help safeguard our common interests. We should firmly adhere to the basic principles of multilateralism and international relations, promote the establishment of a new type of international relations, and create a peaceful and stable environment for the development of all countries. We must promote open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win economic globalization, build an open world economy, support the multilateral trading system, and oppose protectionism. It is necessary to advance the reform of global economic governance, increase the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries, and provide new impetus for resolving the imbalance between north and south development and promoting world economic growth. , Fourth, committed to promoting people-to-people exchanges. The exchange of countries lies in the blind date. Only with deep cultivation can the tree of friendship and cooperation flourish. Strengthening the cultural exchanges among our five countries and putting the partnership concept in the hearts of the people is a work that deserves long-term investment. If this work is done well, the BRICS cooperation will remain viable forever. , We are glad to see that the important consensus reached by the leaders of our five countries on strengthening the BRICS cultural exchange is becoming a reality. This year, the humanities exchanges and cooperation of the five countries have been fully rolled out, and colorful events such as sports meets, film festivals, cultural festivals, and high-level meetings of traditional medicine have been held. It is hoped that with our common concern and promotion, these activities can be regularized and institutionalized, and work hard to reach the grassroots level, face the general public, and create a vivid situation in which all flowers bloom. , Colleagues! The past 10 years have been the 10 years for the BRICS countries to concentrate their efforts on development, and the 10 years for perseverance and deepening of partnership. In the historical process of BRICS cooperation, 10 years is just the beginning. As I said in a letter to my colleagues at the beginning of the year, looking forward to the future, BRICS cooperation will surely get greater development and will also play a greater role in international affairs. Let us work together to promote the BRICS cooperation and set sail from Xiamen once again, opening the door to the second ""Golden Decade"", so that the BRICS cooperation will benefit the people of our five countries and benefit the people of all countries! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, September 4th), ""People's Daily"" (September 05, 2017, 03 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Deepen the BRICS partnership and open up a brighter future,2270,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-09-05,"[, 尊敬的祖马总统，, 尊敬的特梅尔总统，, 尊敬的普京总统，, 尊敬的莫迪总理，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　很高兴同各位同事再次相聚。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，对大家出席金砖国家领导人厦门会晤表示热烈的欢迎。我期待着同各位同事一道，围绕“深化金砖伙伴关系，开辟更加光明未来”的会晤主题，回顾总结金砖合作，勾画未来发展蓝图，开启合作新航程。, 　　金砖合作已经走过10年光辉历程。我们五国虽然山海相隔，但怀着合作共赢的共同目标走到了一起。, 　　中国古人说：“交得其道，千里同好，固于胶漆，坚于金石。”金砖合作之所以得到快速发展，关键在于找准了合作之道。这就是互尊互助，携手走适合本国国情的发展道路；秉持开放包容、合作共赢的精神，持之以恒推进经济、政治、人文合作；倡导国际公平正义，同其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家和衷共济，共同营造良好外部环境。, 　　事实证明，金砖合作契合我们五国发展共同需要，顺应历史大势。尽管我们五国国情不同，但我们对伙伴关系、繁荣发展的追求是共同的，这使我们能够超越差异和分歧，努力实现互利共赢。, 　　当前，世界格局发生了许多深刻复杂变化。在这一背景下，金砖合作显得更加重要。五国人民希望我们携手促进发展，提高人民福祉。国际社会期待我们维护世界和平，推动共同发展。我们应该再接再厉，全面深化金砖伙伴关系，开启金砖合作第二个“金色十年”。, 　　第一，致力于推进经济务实合作。务实合作是金砖合作的根基，在这方面我们成绩斐然。同时，我们也要看到，现在，金砖合作潜力还没有充分释放出来。据统计，2016年金砖国家对外投资1970亿美元，只有5.7%发生在我们五国之间。这说明，我们五国还有广阔合作空间。, 　　我们应该紧紧围绕经济务实合作这条主线，在贸易投资、货币金融、互联互通、可持续发展、创新和产业合作等领域拓展利益汇聚点。今年，我们制定了《金砖国家服务贸易合作路线图》、《金砖国家投资便利化纲要》、《金砖国家电子商务合作倡议》、《金砖国家创新合作行动计划》、《金砖国家深化工业领域合作行动计划》，成立了新开发银行非洲区域中心，决定建立金砖国家示范电子口岸网络，在税收、电子商务、本币债券、政府和社会资本合作、金融机构和服务网络化布局等方面达成积极共识，各领域务实合作不断机制化、实心化，含金量不断提升。, 　　我愿借此机会宣布，中方将设立首期5亿元人民币金砖国家经济技术合作交流计划，用于加强经贸等领域政策交流和务实合作。向新开发银行项目准备基金出资400万美元，支持银行业务运营和长远发展。我们愿同各方一道努力，把以往成果和共识落实好，让现有机制运行好，共同把握新工业革命带来的历史机遇，积极探索务实合作新领域新方式，拉紧联系纽带，让金砖合作机制行稳致远。, 　　第二，致力于加强发展战略对接。我们五国虽然国情不同，但处在相近发展阶段，具有相同发展目标，都已进入经济爬坡过坎的时期。加强发展战略对接，发挥各自在资源、市场、劳动力等方面比较优势，将激发我们五国增长潜力和30亿人民创造力，开辟出巨大发展空间。, 　　我们应该在大局上谋划、关键处落子，本着共商、共建、共享原则，寻找发展政策和优先领域的契合点，继续向贸易投资大市场、货币金融大流通、基础设施大联通目标迈进。要从结构性改革、可持续发展等角度入手，在创新创业、产业产能等领域拓展利益汇聚点，交流分享经验，助力彼此经济发展。处理好增长速度和质量、效益的关系，以落实2030年可持续发展议程为契机，谋求经济、社会、环境效益协调统一，实现联动包容发展。, 　　第三，致力于推动国际秩序朝更加公正合理方向发展。随着我们五国同世界的联系更为紧密，客观上要求我们积极参与全球治理。没有我们五国参与，许多重大紧迫的全球性问题难以有效解决。我们就事关国际和平与发展的问题共同发声，共提方案，既符合国际社会期待，也有助于维护我们的共同利益。, 　　我们应该坚定奉行多边主义和国际关系基本准则，推动构建新型国际关系，为各国发展创造和平稳定环境。要推动开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的经济全球化，建设开放型世界经济，支持多边贸易体制，反对保护主义。要推进全球经济治理改革，提高新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权，为解决南北发展失衡、促进世界经济增长提供新动力。, 　　第四，致力于促进人文民间交流。国之交在于民相亲。只有深耕厚植，友谊和合作之树才能枝繁叶茂。加强我们五国人文交流，让伙伴关系理念扎根人民心中，是一项值得长期投入的工作。这项工作做好了，将使金砖合作永葆活力。, 　　我们高兴地看到，我们五国领导人就加强金砖人文交流达成的重要共识正在变成现实。今年，五国人文交流合作全面铺开，举行了运动会、电影节、文化节、传统医药高级别会议等丰富多彩的活动。希望在我们共同关心和推动下，这些活动能够经常化、机制化，并努力深入基层，面向广大民众，营造百花齐放的生动局面。, 　　各位同事！, 　　过去10年，是金砖国家集中精力谋发展的10年，也是坚持不懈深化伙伴关系的10年。在金砖合作的历史进程中，10年只是一个开端。正如年初我在致各位同事的信中所说，展望未来，金砖合作必将得到更大发展，也必将在国际事务中发挥更大作用。让我们共同努力，推动金砖合作从厦门再次扬帆远航，开启第二个“金色十年”的大门，使金砖合作造福我们五国人民，惠及各国人民！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社厦门9月4日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年09月05日 03 版）, ]",习近平：深化金砖伙伴关系 开辟更加光明未来,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29514692

Let us work together to promote the BRICS cooperation and set sail from Xiamen once again, opening the door to the second ""Golden Decade"", so that the BRICS cooperation will benefit the people of our five countries and benefit the people of all countries! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, September 4th),]",Xi Jinping's speech at the large-scale meeting of BRICS leaders Xiamen,2313,来源：新华社          发布时间：2017-09-04,"[, 　　深化金砖伙伴关系 开辟更加光明未来, 　　——在金砖国家领导人厦门会晤大范围会议上的讲话, 　　中华人民共和国主席　习近平, 　　尊敬的祖马总统，, 　　尊敬的特梅尔总统，, 　　尊敬的普京总统，, 　　尊敬的莫迪总理，, 　　女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　很高兴同各位同事再次相聚。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，对大家出席金砖国家领导人厦门会晤表示热烈的欢迎。我期待着同各位同事一道，围绕“深化金砖伙伴关系，开辟更加光明未来”的会晤主题，回顾总结金砖合作，勾画未来发展蓝图，开启合作新航程。, 　　金砖合作已经走过10年光辉历程。我们五国虽然山海相隔，但怀着合作共赢的共同目标走到了一起。, 　　中国古人说：“交得其道，千里同好，固于胶漆，坚于金石。”金砖合作之所以得到快速发展，关键在于找准了合作之道。这就是互尊互助，携手走适合本国国情的发展道路；秉持开放包容、合作共赢的精神，持之以恒推进经济、政治、人文合作；倡导国际公平正义，同其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家和衷共济，共同营造良好外部环境。, 　　事实证明，金砖合作契合我们五国发展共同需要，顺应历史大势。尽管我们五国国情不同，但我们对伙伴关系、繁荣发展的追求是共同的，这使我们能够超越差异和分歧，努力实现互利共赢。, 　　当前，世界格局发生了许多深刻复杂变化。在这一背景下，金砖合作显得更加重要。五国人民希望我们携手促进发展，提高人民福祉。国际社会期待我们维护世界和平，推动共同发展。我们应该再接再厉，全面深化金砖伙伴关系，开启金砖合作第二个“金色十年”。, 　　第一，致力于推进经济务实合作。务实合作是金砖合作的根基，在这方面我们成绩斐然。同时，我们也要看到，现在，金砖合作潜力还没有充分释放出来。据统计，2016年金砖国家对外投资1970亿美元，只有5.7%发生在我们五国之间。这说明，我们五国还有广阔合作空间。, 　　我们应该紧紧围绕经济务实合作这条主线，在贸易投资、货币金融、互联互通、可持续发展、创新和产业合作等领域拓展利益汇聚点。今年，我们制定了《金砖国家服务贸易合作路线图》、《金砖国家投资便利化纲要》、《金砖国家电子商务合作倡议》、《金砖国家创新合作行动计划》、《金砖国家深化工业领域合作行动计划》，成立了新开发银行非洲区域中心，决定建立金砖国家示范电子口岸网络，在税收、电子商务、本币债券、政府和社会资本合作、金融机构和服务网络化布局等方面达成积极共识，各领域务实合作不断机制化、实心化，含金量不断提升。, 　　我愿借此机会宣布，中方将设立首期5亿元人民币金砖国家经济技术合作交流计划，用于加强经贸等领域政策交流和务实合作。向新开发银行项目准备基金出资400万美元，支持银行业务运营和长远发展。我们愿同各方一道努力，把以往成果和共识落实好，让现有机制运行好，共同把握新工业革命带来的历史机遇，积极探索务实合作新领域新方式，拉紧联系纽带，让金砖合作机制行稳致远。, 　　第二，致力于加强发展战略对接。我们五国虽然国情不同，但处在相近发展阶段，具有相同发展目标，都已进入经济爬坡过坎的时期。加强发展战略对接，发挥各自在资源、市场、劳动力等方面比较优势，将激发我们五国增长潜力和30亿人民创造力，开辟出巨大发展空间。, 　　我们应该在大局上谋划、关键处落子，本着共商、共建、共享原则，寻找发展政策和优先领域的契合点，继续向贸易投资大市场、货币金融大流通、基础设施大联通目标迈进。要从结构性改革、可持续发展等角度入手，在创新创业、产业产能等领域拓展利益汇聚点，交流分享经验，助力彼此经济发展。处理好增长速度和质量、效益的关系，以落实2030年可持续发展议程为契机，谋求经济、社会、环境效益协调统一，实现联动包容发展。, 　　第三，致力于推动国际秩序朝更加公正合理方向发展。随着我们五国同世界的联系更为紧密，客观上要求我们积极参与全球治理。没有我们五国参与，许多重大紧迫的全球性问题难以有效解决。我们就事关国际和平与发展的问题共同发声，共提方案，既符合国际社会期待，也有助于维护我们的共同利益。, 　　我们应该坚定奉行多边主义和国际关系基本准则，推动构建新型国际关系，为各国发展创造和平稳定环境。要推动开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的经济全球化，建设开放型世界经济，支持多边贸易体制，反对保护主义。要推进全球经济治理改革，提高新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权，为解决南北发展失衡、促进世界经济增长提供新动力。, 　　第四，致力于促进人文民间交流。国之交在于民相亲。只有深耕厚植，友谊和合作之树才能枝繁叶茂。加强我们五国人文交流，让伙伴关系理念扎根人民心中，是一项值得长期投入的工作。这项工作做好了，将使金砖合作永葆活力。, 　　我们高兴地看到，我们五国领导人就加强金砖人文交流达成的重要共识正在变成现实。今年，五国人文交流合作全面铺开，举行了运动会、电影节、文化节、传统医药高级别会议等丰富多彩的活动。希望在我们共同关心和推动下，这些活动能够经常化、机制化，并努力深入基层，面向广大民众，营造百花齐放的生动局面。, 　　各位同事！, 　　过去10年，是金砖国家集中精力谋发展的10年，也是坚持不懈深化伙伴关系的10年。在金砖合作的历史进程中，10年只是一个开端。正如年初我在致各位同事的信中所说，展望未来，金砖合作必将得到更大发展，也必将在国际事务中发挥更大作用。让我们共同努力，推动金砖合作从厦门再次扬帆远航，开启第二个“金色十年”的大门，使金砖合作造福我们五国人民，惠及各国人民！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社厦门9月4日电）, ]",习近平在金砖国家领导人厦门会晤大范围会议上的讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29514447
10,43,"[, People's Daily Beijing, July 4th] On July 4th, during a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""For a Better World"" in the mainstream German media. The article is as follows:, For a better world, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, I am very happy to pay another state visit to Germany and attend the summit of the G20 Hamburg Summit in midsummer. , This visit coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Germany. Over the past 45 years, Sino-German relations have generally developed smoothly, and pragmatic cooperation has been continuously deepened. During my first state visit to Germany in 2014, both sides agreed to promote the relationship between the two countries into an all-round strategic partnership, turning a new chapter in Sino-German relations. , ——Sino-German relations have been continuously improved strategically. The frequent high-level visits between the two countries have enhanced mutual understanding, understanding and political mutual trust. In 2014, the two sides published the ""Sino-Germany Cooperation Action Plan: Building Innovations Together"", which has become a programmatic document that guides the medium- and long-term development of bilateral relations. At present, the two sides have established more than 70 different levels of dialogue and cooperation mechanisms, including Sino-German government consultations, especially Sino-German diplomatic and security strategic dialogues, Sino-German high-level financial, cultural, and security dialogue mechanisms, and the Sino-German Economic Advisory Committee The successive launches have enriched the connotation of the all-round strategic partnership between China and Germany. Sino-German cooperation has also gradually extended to aerospace, ocean, polar, network and other spaces. , ——Sino-German pragmatic cooperation has achieved fruitful results. Germany has maintained China's largest trading partner status in Europe for 42 consecutive years. According to German statistics, in 2016, the bilateral trade volume between China and Germany was 170 billion euros, and China became Germany's largest trading partner for the first time. Germany is the country with the largest number of technology transfers from China to Europe. As of May 2017, the cumulative value of China’s technology import contracts from Germany was 76.82 billion US dollars. The Sino-German investment cooperation entered the ""two-way express lane"" from the ""one-way street"". Cities such as Duisburg and Hamburg have become important hubs for China and Europe. Sino-German pragmatic cooperation not only plays an important leading role in Sino-European relations, but also becomes a model of mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation among the world's most important economies. , ——Sino-German cultural exchanges are booming. Since 2013, the two countries have held large-scale exchange years such as the Year of Languages, Year of Innovation Partners, and Year of Youth Exchange. China has opened a Chinese Cultural Center, 19 Confucius Institutes, and 4 Confucius Classrooms in Germany. The Goethe-Institut, German Academic Exchange Center and other institutions in China are also actively committed to Sino-German cultural exchanges. More than 40,000 Chinese students studying in Germany are the largest group of foreign students in Germany; there are as many as 30,000 German experts in China and 8,200 German students. In 2016, China-Germany personnel exchanges exceeded 2 million. Local exchanges between the two countries are frequent, and 91 pairs of friendly provinces, states and cities have been established. In November 2016, China and Germany signed a number of football cooperation agreements, and the two countries took new steps in football cooperation. At present, human society is in an era of great development, big changes and big adjustments. With multi-polarization of the world, economic globalization, social informatization, and cultural diversification, humanity has become a community of destiny between you and me. At the same time, we are also in a world where challenges are frequent. Regional hotspots continue to turmoil, terrorism spreads and rages, and peace deficits, development deficits, and governance deficits are serious challenges facing all mankind. , China and Germany, as the world’s second and fourth largest economies, major trading powers, and countries with important influence, China and Germany must shoulder important responsibilities for peace, stability, and prosperity in the world and regions. . , An important task of my visit to Germany this time is to exchange in-depth views with German leaders such as President Steinmeier and Prime Minister Merkel on how to seize the opportunities under the new situation and better promote the all-round strategic partnership between China and Germany. To promote greater development of Sino-German relations at a high level. We must strengthen the top-level design of the relationship between the two countries and plan a blueprint for the development of the relationship between the two countries with a broader mind and broader vision. Give play to the leading role of institutional dialogue at all levels and strengthen strategic communication on bilateral relations and major international and regional issues. We will properly handle differences through equal dialogue and friendly consultations, and understand and support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests and major concerns. , We must use innovative, open and inclusive thinking to strengthen the ""Made in China 2025"" and Germany's ""Industry 4.0"" strategic docking. Create a two-way open and fair competition investment environment, deepen pragmatic cooperation in the fields of innovation, the Internet, smart manufacturing, finance, energy, environmental protection, green development, and expand third-party market cooperation. Strengthen cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the “Belt and Road” initiativePragmatic cooperation in the fields of manufacturing, finance, energy, environmental protection, and green development, and expand third-party market cooperation. Strengthen cooperation between the two countries within the framework of the “Belt and Road” construction and jointly contribute to the security, stability and prosperity of the countries along the route. We need to make use of the overall coordination role of the high-level cultural exchange and dialogue mechanism, deepen cooperation in the fields of education, culture, science and technology, tourism, health, think tanks, media, football, etc., implement visa and other facilitation measures, and bring people closer together. I am very happy that during this visit, I will be with Prime Minister Merkel to attend the opening of the Giant Panda Pavilion at the Berlin Zoo. I hope that the pair of giant pandas who have arrived in Berlin will become messengers of Sino-German friendship. , We must strengthen mutual cooperation and cooperation between the two parties in the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other international organizations and institutions, and work together to improve and perfect international mechanisms and rules to maintain regional stability. Make due contributions to world peace, promote the healthy development of the world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. , In September last year, on the beautiful West Lake, at the summit of the G20 leaders in Hangzhou, China and the parties gathered consensus to reach a series of innovative achievements to promote strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy Important contribution. At present, the momentum of world economic growth is further consolidated. The economic situation in developed and emerging market countries is generally improving, but it is also facing severe challenges. Against this background, the G20 continues to play the role of the main forum for international economic cooperation, implement the consensus of the Hangzhou Summit and previous summits, and lead the direction of the world economy, which is particularly important and in the interest of all parties. China supports the German side to hold a successful summit in Hamburg and is also looking forward to this summit. ——I hope that the G20 will continue to uphold the spirit of partnership for mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. The G20 is an important platform for equal dialogue, communication and coordination among the major economies in the world. The spirit of partnership for mutual benefit and win-win cooperation is the most important asset of the G20. This spirit guides the G20 through the ups and downs of the international financial crisis and will also inspire the G20 to lead the world economic trend. As long as nations are tolerant and help each other, they will surely move forward. ——I hope that the G20 will continue to hold high the banner of the era of building an open world economy. Economic globalization provides a strong impetus for world economic growth, promotes the flow of commodities and capital, advances in science and technology and civilization, and contacts between peoples of all countries. The problems arising in the process of economic globalization must be properly resolved. The G20 should insist on open development, support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization as its core, and promote trade and investment to continue to play the role of the world’s economic growth engine. ——I hope that the G20 will continue to lead the development path of innovative growth and long-term governance. The current world economic growth momentum is hard-won, and the opportunities and challenges brought about by new technologies and new formats coexist. To consolidate the growth momentum of the world economy, all countries must innovate to explore the new impetus for world economic growth, comprehensively use fiscal policy, monetary policy, and structural reform to promote the world economy to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. , The “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum successfully held in Beijing not long ago is aimed at strengthening the connection and interconnection of the development strategies of relevant countries and regions to achieve joint development, which is highly compatible with the theme of this year’s Hamburg Summit, “Shaping a Linked World” . The Belt and Road Initiative and the G20 cooperation can complement and promote each other. China is willing to use the Hamburg Summit as an opportunity to work with all parties to send a clear signal on international economic cooperation and global economic governance, and make positive contributions to promoting world economic growth and improving global economic governance. , I look forward to working with Germany to advance the all-round strategic partnership between China and Germany and promote the Hamburg Summit to a complete success. Because our goals are common, this is to build a better world. , ""People's Daily"" (July 05, 2017, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in German media,2773,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-07-05,"[, 　　人民网北京7月4日电  7月4日，在对德意志联邦共和国进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平在德国主流媒体发表题为《为了一个更加美好的世界》的署名文章。文章如下：, 　　为了一个更加美好的世界, 　　中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 　　盛夏时节，我很高兴再次对德国进行国事访问，并出席二十国集团领导人汉堡峰会。, 　　这次访问恰逢中德建交45周年。45年来，中德关系发展总体顺利，务实合作不断加深。2014年我首次对德国进行国事访问期间，双方一致同意将两国关系提升为全方位战略伙伴关系，翻开了中德关系新篇章。, 　　——中德关系战略性不断提升。两国高层互访频密，增进了相互了解、理解和政治互信。2014年双方发表《中德合作行动纲要：共塑创新》，成为指导两国关系中长期发展的纲领性文件。目前，双方已经建立包括中德政府磋商在内70多个不同层级的对话合作机制，尤其是中德外交与安全战略对话，中德高级别财金、人文、安全对话机制，中德经济顾问委员会等相继启动，充实了中德全方位战略伙伴关系的内涵。中德合作也逐渐向航空航天、海洋、极地、网络等空间延伸。, 　　——中德务实合作成果丰硕。德国已连续42年保持中国在欧洲最大贸易伙伴地位。据德方统计，2016年，中德双边贸易额1700亿欧元，中国首次成为德国最大贸易伙伴。德国是欧洲对华技术转让最多的国家，截至2017年5月，中国从德国引进技术合同累计金额768.2亿美元。中德投资合作由“单行道”进入“双向快车道”。杜伊斯堡、汉堡等城市已成为中欧班列在欧洲的重要枢纽。中德务实合作不仅在中欧关系中发挥着重要引领作用，也成为全球最重要经济体开展互利共赢合作的典范。, 　　——中德人文交流蓬勃发展。2013年以来，两国相继举行语言年、创新伙伴年、青少年交流年等大型交流年活动。中国在德国已开设中国文化中心以及19所孔子学院、4所孔子课堂，德国歌德学院、德意志学术交流中心等在华机构也积极致力于中德人文交流。超过4万名中国学生在德国学习，是德国最大的外国留学生群体；在华德国专家多达3万人，德国留学生也达到8200人。2016年，中德人员往来超过200万人次。两国地方交流频密，目前已建立91对友好省州（市）关系。2016年11月，中德签署了多项足球合作协议，两国足球合作迈出新步伐。, 　　当前，人类社会正处在一个大发展大变革大调整时代。世界多极化、经济全球化、社会信息化、文化多样化深入发展，人类已经成为你中有我、我中有你的命运共同体。同时，我们也处在一个挑战频发的世界，地区热点持续动荡，恐怖主义蔓延肆虐，和平赤字、发展赤字、治理赤字是摆在全人类面前的严峻挑战。, 　　中国和德国作为世界第二和第四大经济体、主要贸易大国、具有重要影响力的国家，中德两国要发展好自己，也要对世界和地区和平、稳定、繁荣肩负起重要责任。, 　　我这次访问德国的一个重要任务就是同施泰因迈尔总统、默克尔总理等德国领导人就新形势下如何抓住机遇、更好统筹推进中德全方位战略伙伴关系深入交换意见，推动中德关系在高水平上得到更大发展。, 　　我们要加强对两国关系的顶层设计，以更加宽广的胸襟和开阔的视野谋划两国关系发展蓝图。发挥各层级机制性对话的引领作用，就双边关系及重大国际和地区问题加强战略沟通。通过平等对话和友好协商妥善处理分歧，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互理解和支持。, 　　我们要以开拓创新和开放包容的思维，加强“中国制造2025”同德国的“工业4.0”战略对接。营造双向开放、公平竞争的投资环境，深化创新、互联网、智能制造、金融、能源、环保、绿色发展等领域务实合作，拓展第三方市场合作。加强两国在“一带一路”建设框架内合作，共同为沿线国家的安全、稳定、繁荣作出贡献。, 　　我们要发挥高级别人文交流对话机制的统筹协调作用，深化教育、文化、科技、旅游、卫生、智库、媒体、足球等领域合作，实施签证等便利化措施，拉近两国民众距离。我很高兴这次访问期间将同默克尔总理一道出席柏林动物园大熊猫馆开馆活动，希望已经抵达柏林的这对大熊猫成为中德友谊的使者。, 　　我们要加强双方在联合国、国际货币基金组织、世界贸易组织、亚洲基础设施投资银行等国际组织和机构中的相互协作和配合，共同致力于国际机制和规则的改进和完善，为维护地区稳定和世界和平、促进世界经济健康发展、推动构建人类命运共同体作出应有贡献。, 　　去年9月，在美丽的西子湖畔，在二十国集团领导人杭州峰会上，中方同各方凝聚共识，达成一系列创新性成果，为推动世界经济强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长作出了重要贡献。, 　　当前，世界经济增长势头进一步巩固，发达国家和新兴市场国家经济形势普遍向好，但也面临严峻挑战。在这一背景下，二十国集团继续发挥国际经济合作主要论坛作用、落实杭州峰会及历届峰会共识、引领世界经济前进方向尤为重要，也符合各方利益。中方支持德方在汉堡举办一届成功的峰会，也对这次峰会充满期待。, 　　——希望二十国集团继续秉持同舟共济、合作共赢的伙伴精神。二十国集团是世界主要经济体平等对话、沟通协调的重要平台，同舟共济、合作共赢的伙伴精神是二十国集团最重要的财富。这种精神指引二十国集团走过国际金融危机风雨，也将鼓舞二十国集团引领世界经济潮流。只要各国本着彼此包容、守望相助的初心，就一定能坚定前行。, 　　——希望二十国集团继续高举建设开放型世界经济的时代旗帜。经济全球化为世界经济增长提供了强劲动力，促进了商品和资本流动、科技和文明进步、各国人民交往。对于经济全球化进程中出现的问题，要妥善加以解决。二十国集团应该坚持开放发展，支持以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，推动贸易和投资继续发挥世界经济增长引擎作用。, 　　——希望二十国集团继续引领创新增长、长效治理的发展路径。当今世界经济增长势头来之不易，新技术、新业态带来的机遇和挑战并存。要巩固世界经济增长势头，各国就要通过创新挖掘世界经济增长新动力，综合运用财政政策、货币政策、结构性改革，促进世界经济实现强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长。, 　　不久前在北京成功举行的“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，旨在加强有关国家和地区发展战略对接和互联互通，实现联动发展，同今年汉堡峰会的主题——“塑造联动世界”高度契合。“一带一路”倡议和二十国集团合作可以相互补充、相互促进。中方愿以汉堡峰会为契机，同各方一道努力，就国际经济合作和全球经济治理发出明确信号，为促进世界经济增长、完善全球经济治理作出积极贡献。, 　　我期待着同德方一道努力，推进中德全方位战略伙伴关系，推动汉堡峰会取得圆满成功。因为我们的目标是共同的，这就是建设一个更加美好的世界。, 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年07月05日 02 版）, ]",习近平在德国媒体发表署名文章,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29384703
11,44,"[, Dear President Nazarbayev, Dear Colleagues,, It is a pleasure to come to Astana to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. The vitality displayed by this city is a vivid portrayal of the Organization’s vigorous development. Thanks to the host Kazakhstan and President Nazarbayev for their careful preparation and thoughtful arrangements. Over the past year, Kazakhstan, as the rotating presidency, has done a lot of fruitful work. China highly appreciates this. This year is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation among the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Taking these two programmatic documents as the cornerstones and guidelines for action, member states firmly adhere to the ""Shanghai Spirit"" and have taken increasingly solid steps on the road to building a community of shared destiny, setting a new model of international relations for win-win cooperation. Today, we will accept India and Pakistan as member countries. At present, the international and regional situation is undergoing profound and complex changes, and unstable and uncertain factors are increasing. Only when all countries work together can they properly respond to threats and challenges. China is willing to work with all parties to strengthen the sense of community of destiny and build a common homeland of security, stability, development and prosperity. To this end, I make the following suggestions. , First, consolidate unity and cooperation. There is a proverb in Kazakhstan, ""where there is unity, there must be happiness."" The strong cohesion produced by the ""Shanghai Spirit"" is a guarantee for the development of the organization. We need to maintain a good tradition of solidarity and cooperation. New and old member states should integrate closely, deepen political mutual trust, increase mutual support, and build a community of shared destiny that treats each other as equals, keeps watch, helps each other, and shares safety and security. China proposes to formulate an implementation outline for the ""Shanghai Treaty Member State's Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty"" over the next five years, and plans for the next phase of cooperation in various fields. It is recommended to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the legislative bodies, political parties, and judicial areas to provide channels for all parties to carry out policy communication. , Second, work together to meet the challenge. Security is the cornerstone of development. There can be no development without security. The recent violent terrorist incidents in the region show that the fight against the ""three forces"" still has a long way to go. We must, as always, maintain the security and stability of the region as the priority direction of the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China supports the implementation of the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization Anti-Extremism Convention"" signed at this summit to effectively curb the spread of extremism. In order to improve the coordination and operational capabilities of member countries in the security field, China advocates strengthening the construction of regional anti-terrorism institutions and cracking down on drug trafficking, and is willing to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Network Anti-Terrorism Joint Exercise again, and proposes to organize a defense security forum to formulate the next three years Combating the ""three forces"" cooperation outline. China supports the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s unanimous voice in international and regional affairs and contributes to the political resolution of hot issues. China is concerned about the recent deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan, calling on all parties to support the peace reconciliation process in Afghanistan and looking forward to the ""Shanghai Cooperation Organization-Afghanistan Liaison Group"" playing a more active role in the cause of peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan. , Third, deepen pragmatic cooperation. Regional integration and economic globalization are the trend of the times, and countries and peoples should benefit from this process. Last month, the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum was successfully held in Beijing. China and relevant parties are actively promoting the integration of the “Belt and Road” construction with regional cooperation initiatives such as the construction of the Eurasian Economic Union and the development strategies of Kazakhstan’s “Bright Road”. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization can play an important role in this regard. China proposes to gradually establish institutional arrangements for regional economic cooperation, starting with the signing of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement. In order to improve the level of connectivity among countries in the region, China supports the scheduled opening of cross-border routes as stipulated in the Agreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport among the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, welcomes other countries in the region to join the agreement, and endorses the development of coordinated highway development in member countries planning. In order to mobilize more resources and power to promote pragmatic cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China supports the establishment of local cooperation mechanisms and actively develops cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises, and proposes the establishment of an economic think tank alliance and an e-commerce business alliance. It is recommended to make full use of the existing platform to finance the organization's project cooperation, and at the same time continue to study the feasible way of establishing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Development Bank at the expert level. , Fourth, tighten the human bond. We must promote the spiritual communication between the people of all countries, especially the younger generation, so that the cause of good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation will remain viable forever. The Chinese side is willing to work with all parties to continue to carry out the operation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization University, run brand projects such as youth exchange camps and summer camps for primary and secondary school students, and host the Shanghai Cooperation Organization National Culture and Art Festival, Women's Forum, and Employee Skills Competition. Promote cooperation in areas such as health, disaster relief, environmental protection, sports, and tourism. inOrganize national cultural and art festivals, women's forums, employee skills competitions and other activities, and solidly promote cooperation in the fields of health, disaster relief, environmental protection, sports, and tourism. China will start the implementation of the ""China-Shanghai Cooperation Organization Human Resources Development Cooperation Program"" by inviting personnel from member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to study in China, sending Chinese expert consultants to member countries to provide policy advice, and conducting local training within the member countries. The number of government scholarships and other means to increase the breadth and depth of cooperation with member countries in the field of human resources development. To promote the communication between the people, the media cannot be absent. China proposes to establish a media cooperation mechanism and will host the first media summit of the organization. , Fifth, insist on openness and tolerance. Opening to the outside world is a basic principle established at the beginning of the organization. China supports the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in conducting multi-modal and wide-ranging cooperation with observer countries, dialogue partners, and other countries, and continues to seriously study the applications of the relevant countries for obtaining the legal status of the Organization in accordance with relevant regulations and the principle of consensus. China agrees that the Organization should continue to expand exchanges and cooperation with the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, and work together to promote the cause of lasting peace and common prosperity in the world.

12,45,"[, Heads of State, Heads of Government, and Heads of International Organizations:, I announce the opening of the Roundtable Summit of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum! , Welcome everyone to Yanqi Lake to attend the round-table summit of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum to discuss the promotion of international cooperation and achieve a win-win development plan. , ""Belt and Road"" construction is an initiative I put forward in 2013. Its core content is to promote infrastructure construction and interconnection, connect countries' policies and development strategies, deepen pragmatic cooperation, promote coordinated and joint development, and achieve common prosperity. , This initiative stems from my observation and thinking of the world situation. The world today is undergoing major developments, major changes and major adjustments. A new round of science and technology and industrial revolution is being conceived, new growth momentum is constantly accumulating, the interests of all countries are deeply integrated, and peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation have become the trend of the times. At the same time, the deep-seated contradictions in global development have accumulated for a long time and have not been effectively resolved. The foundation of global economic growth is not strong enough, trade and investment are sluggish, economic globalization has encountered setbacks, and development imbalances have intensified. Issues such as wars and conflicts, terrorism, and large-scale flows of refugees and immigrants have a prominent impact on the world economy. In the face of challenges, countries are discussing countermeasures, and have put forward many good development strategies and cooperation initiatives. However, today, when countries are interdependent and global challenges are emerging one after another, it is difficult to rely on the power of a single country alone, nor can it solve the problems facing the world. Only by cooperating with each other's policies and integrating economic factors and development resources on a larger scale in the world can we form synergy and promote world peace and common development. , The construction of the “Belt and Road” is rooted in history, but it faces the future. The ancient Silk Road embodies the ancestors' pursuit of a better life, promotes the interconnection of countries in Asia and Europe, promotes the exchange and mutual learning of Eastern and Western civilizations, and makes a major contribution to the development and progress of human civilization. We can draw wisdom and strength from the ancient Silk Road, advance cooperation in the Silk Road spirit of peaceful cooperation, openness and tolerance, mutual learning, mutual benefit and win-win results, and jointly open up brighter prospects. , ""Belt and Road"" originates from China, but belongs to the world. The “Belt and Road” construction spans different regions, different development stages, and different civilizations. It is an open and inclusive cooperation platform and a global public product jointly created by all parties. It focuses on Asia and Europe and is open to all like-minded friends. It does not exclude or target any party. Within the framework of international cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road”, all parties uphold the principles of mutual consultation, co-construction and sharing, and work together to meet the challenges facing the world economy, create new opportunities for development, seek new development momentum, expand new development space, and achieve complementary advantages , Mutual benefit and win-win, and constantly move towards the community of human destiny. This is my original intention to put forward this initiative, and also the highest goal I hope to achieve through this initiative. , I am glad to see that after this initiative was put forward, it received positive response and wide support from the international community. More than 100 countries and international organizations participated in it. A large number of cooperation projects have been launched one after another, and some have already taken root. The infrastructure connectivity network has initially taken shape, industrial cooperation along the route has formed momentum, policy coordination in various countries has been continuously strengthened, the people have begun to benefit from cooperation, and the distance between them has been further reduced. On this basis, China proposes to host this summit forum. The purpose is to discuss cooperation plans, build a cooperation platform, and share cooperation results, so that the construction of the “Belt and Road” will benefit the people of all countries. At yesterday’s high-level meeting, leaders of various countries, heads of international organizations, and representatives of officials, industry, and academia presented many insightful ideas and suggestions, and signed a number of cooperation agreements. We hope that through today’s roundtable summit, we will further build consensus, point out the direction for the development of international cooperation in the “Belt and Road” initiative, and draw up a blueprint. Specifically, I expect the meeting to achieve positive results in the following areas. First, promote mutual benefit and win-win results and define the direction of cooperation. The key to the ability of the wild geese to ride through the wind and rain and travel stably and far is that they go together and borrow each other. This reveals a profound truth for us to cope with challenges and achieve better development. In the spirit of partnership, we must firmly adhere to mutual consultation, co-construction, and sharing, so that policy communication, facility connectivity, smooth trade, capital and financial connectivity, and people-to-people communication become the goals of joint efforts. We must insist on cooperation in openness, win-win in cooperation, do not draw ground for prison, set high thresholds, do not engage in exclusive arrangements, and oppose protectionism. The construction of the “Belt and Road” requires a peaceful and stable environment. All countries should strengthen cooperation, resolve differences through dialogue, resolve disputes through consultation, and jointly maintain regional security and stability. , Second, close policy coordination and docking with development strategies. Strengthen policy coordination and not engage in neighbourhood,Resolve disputes and jointly maintain regional security and stability. , Second, close policy coordination and docking with development strategies. Strengthening policy coordination and not taking neighbors as the beggars is an important experience in dealing with the international financial crisis and an objective requirement of the current world economic development. Everyone formulates development strategies based on their own national conditions. They each have their own characteristics, but their goals are the same. There are many points of contact and similarities that can complement each other and promote each other. Based on this, we need to establish a policy coordination and docking mechanism, learn from each other, and work together on this basis to formulate cooperation plans and jointly take cooperative actions to form a situation of planning convergence, development integration, and benefit sharing. We must combine the international cooperation in building the “Belt and Road” with the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievements of the G20 Hangzhou Summit. Together with APEC, ASEAN, AU, Eurasian Economic Union, EU and Latin America The development plans of the whole country are connected and coordinated with the development plans put forward by the relevant countries, resulting in the effect of ""one plus one is greater than two. , Third, rely on project-driven, deepen pragmatic cooperation. The road is out, the career is out. A beautiful blueprint becomes a reality and requires solid action. In terms of infrastructure connectivity, it is necessary to promote the construction of large land passages such as railways and highways, speed up the construction of offshore ports, and improve oil and gas pipelines, power transmission, and communication networks. In terms of real economic cooperation, it is necessary to vigorously promote the construction of economic corridors, establish economic and trade, industrial cooperation parks, further promote investment, gather industries, drive employment, and take the road of innovation and development. In terms of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, it is necessary to promote the construction of free trade zones, strengthen the compatibility of rules and standard systems, provide a better business environment and institutional guarantees, and fully release the positive effects of interconnection. In terms of financial cooperation, it is necessary to expand financing channels, innovate financing methods, reduce financing costs, and open up a key link in the financing project. , People-to-people communication is an important part of the “Belt and Road” international cooperation. We must carry out in-depth exchanges and cooperation in the field of humanities, make cooperation more inclusive, make the foundation of cooperation more solid, and let the general public become the main force and beneficiaries of the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. , Colleagues! , Yanqi Lake is a place with historical accumulation, a place to enlighten ideas, and a place to start a journey of cooperation. Many people metaphorically say that the ""Belt and Road"" is like a pair of flying wings. Let us take Yanqi Lake as a new starting point, spread our wings, and fly to the vast blue sky together, to the distance of peace, development, cooperation and win-win! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15), ""People's Daily"" (May 16, 2017, 03 edition),]","Xi Jinping's Opening Remarks at the Roundtable Summit of the ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum",2329,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-05-16,"[, 各位国家元首，政府首脑，国际组织负责人：, 我宣布，“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛圆桌峰会开幕！, 欢迎大家来到雁栖湖畔出席“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛圆桌峰会，共商推进国际合作、实现共赢发展大计。, “一带一路”建设是我在2013年提出的倡议。它的核心内容是促进基础设施建设和互联互通，对接各国政策和发展战略，深化务实合作，促进协调联动发展，实现共同繁荣。, 这项倡议源于我对世界形势的观察和思考。当今世界正处在大发展大变革大调整之中。新一轮科技和产业革命正在孕育，新的增长动能不断积聚，各国利益深度融合，和平、发展、合作、共赢成为时代潮流。与此同时，全球发展中的深层次矛盾长期累积，未能得到有效解决。全球经济增长基础不够牢固，贸易和投资低迷，经济全球化遇到波折，发展不平衡加剧。战乱和冲突、恐怖主义、难民移民大规模流动等问题对世界经济的影响突出。, 面对挑战，各国都在探讨应对之策，也提出很多很好的发展战略和合作倡议。但是，在各国彼此依存、全球性挑战此起彼伏的今天，仅凭单个国家的力量难以独善其身，也无法解决世界面临的问题。只有对接各国彼此政策，在全球更大范围内整合经济要素和发展资源，才能形成合力，促进世界和平安宁和共同发展。, “一带一路”建设根植于历史，但面向未来。古丝绸之路凝聚了先辈们对美好生活的追求，促进了亚欧大陆各国互联互通，推动了东西方文明交流互鉴，为人类文明发展进步作出了重大贡献。我们完全可以从古丝绸之路中汲取智慧和力量，本着和平合作、开放包容、互学互鉴、互利共赢的丝路精神推进合作，共同开辟更加光明的前景。, “一带一路”源自中国，但属于世界。“一带一路”建设跨越不同地域、不同发展阶段、不同文明，是一个开放包容的合作平台，是各方共同打造的全球公共产品。它以亚欧大陆为重点，向所有志同道合的朋友开放，不排除、也不针对任何一方。, 在“一带一路”建设国际合作框架内，各方秉持共商、共建、共享原则，携手应对世界经济面临的挑战，开创发展新机遇，谋求发展新动力，拓展发展新空间，实现优势互补、互利共赢，不断朝着人类命运共同体方向迈进。这是我提出这一倡议的初衷，也是希望通过这一倡议实现的最高目标。, 我高兴地看到，这一倡议提出以后，得到国际社会积极响应和广泛支持。100多个国家和国际组织参与其中，一大批合作项目陆续启动，有的已经落地生根。基础设施联通网络初步成型，沿线产业合作形成势头，各国政策协调不断加强，民众已经开始从合作中得到实惠，彼此距离进一步拉近。, 在这个基础上，中方倡议主办这次高峰论坛，目的就是共商合作大计，共建合作平台，共享合作成果，让“一带一路”建设更好造福各国人民。, 昨天的高级别会议上，各国领导人、国际组织负责人和官、产、学各界代表提出了很多有见地的想法和建议，签署了多项合作协议。希望大家通过今天的圆桌峰会，进一步凝聚共识，为“一带一路”建设国际合作指明方向，勾画蓝图。具体而言，我期待会议在以下方面取得积极成果。, 第一，推动互利共赢，明确合作方向。大雁之所以能够穿越风雨、行稳致远，关键在于其结伴成行，相互借力。这为我们合作应对挑战、实现更好发展揭示了一个深刻道理。, 我们要本着伙伴精神，牢牢坚持共商、共建、共享，让政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通成为共同努力的目标。要坚持在开放中合作，在合作中共赢，不画地为牢，不设高门槛，不搞排他性安排，反对保护主义。, “一带一路”建设需要和平稳定环境。各国要加强合作，对话化解分歧，协商解决争端，共同维护地区安全稳定。, 第二，密切政策协调，对接发展战略。加强政策协调，不搞以邻为壑，是应对国际金融危机的重要经验，也是当前世界经济发展的客观要求。大家基于自身国情制定发展战略，它们各有特色，但目标一致，有很多联系点和相通之处，可以做到相辅相成、相互促进。, 我们要以此为基础，建立政策协调对接机制，相互学习借鉴，并在这一基础上共同制定合作方案，共同采取合作行动，形成规划衔接、发展融合、利益共享局面。我们要把“一带一路”建设国际合作同落实联合国2030年可持续发展议程、二十国集团领导人杭州峰会成果结合起来，同亚太经合组织、东盟、非盟、欧亚经济联盟、欧盟、拉共体区域发展规划对接起来，同有关国家提出的发展规划协调起来，产生“一加一大于二”的效果。, 第三，依托项目驱动，深化务实合作。路是走出来的，事业是干出来的。美好的蓝图变成现实，需要扎扎实实的行动。, 在基础设施联通方面，要推进铁路、公路等陆上大通道建设，加快海上港口建设，完善油气管道、电力输送、通信网络。, 在实体经济合作方面，要大力推进经济走廊建设，办好经贸、产业合作园区，进一步促进投资、聚合产业、带动就业，走创新发展之路。, 在贸易和投资自由化便利化方面，要推动自由贸易区建设，加强规则和标准体系相互兼容，提供更好的营商环境和机制保障，充分释放互联互通的积极效应。, 在金融合作方面，要拓展融资渠道，创新融资方式，降低融资成本，打通融资这一项目推进的关键环节。, 民心相通是“一带一路”建设国际合作的重要内容。我们要深入开展人文领域交流合作，让合作更加包容，让合作基础更加坚实，让广大民众成为“一带一路”建设的主力军和受益者。, 各位同事！, 雁栖湖是一个有历史积淀的地方，是一个启迪思想的地方，也是一个开启合作征程的地方。很多人形象地比喻说，“一带一路”就像一对腾飞的翅膀。让我们以雁栖湖为新的起点，张开双翼，一起飞向辽阔的蓝天，飞向和平、发展、合作、共赢的远方！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京5月15日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2017年05月16日 03 版）, ]",习近平在“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛圆桌峰会上的开幕辞,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29277193
13,46,"[, Colleagues:, Just now, we have completed the discussion of the final stage of the meeting, and the Roundtable Summit of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum is coming to a close. For this meeting, everyone has gathered in Beijing from all over the world with a sincere desire to enhance friendship, promote cooperation, and seek development. In a warm, friendly and harmonious atmosphere, we spoke freely around the theme of the meeting, expressed our opinions, shared policy practices and cooperation experiences, looked forward to the future vision and direction of efforts, and put forward many good suggestions and ideas. As far as the agenda of the meeting is concerned, the time of the day seems a little bit tense, but we went straight to the topic and talked pragmatically, both in depth and in breadth, and harvested rich results. Specifically, we have formed a broad consensus in the following areas. , First, we are committed to promoting ""One Belt, One Road"" international cooperation and working together to meet the challenges facing the world economy. Everyone positively evaluates the progress made in the international cooperation on the construction of the “Belt and Road”, and believes that under the current world economic situation, the construction of the “Belt and Road” is of great significance for tapping new economic growth points, enhancing the endogenous development momentum of various countries, and promoting global economic growth. It is conducive to promoting the development of economic globalization inclusive and inclusive. We are willing to continue our efforts to promote greater progress in the construction of the “Belt and Road”, to enable more effective policy communication among countries, more efficient facility connectivity, smoother trade, more financial resources, and greater public support. Secondly, we support strengthening economic policy coordination and development strategy integration, and strive to achieve coordinated and coordinated development. Everyone has a high degree of consensus in this regard, and hopes to form a joint force for policy coordination and planning docking through the development of the “Belt and Road” international cooperation. We agree to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination in the fields of economy, finance, trade, and investment, and jointly create a favorable external development environment. We support the construction of an open world economy, promote the construction of free trade zones, and promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. We look forward to strengthening effective docking, complementing each other's strengths, and synergizing with each other's development strategies and cooperation plans formulated by international and regional organizations. We all value innovation and development, and support cooperation in frontier areas such as cross-border e-commerce, big data, smart cities, and low-carbon development to foster new industries, new formats, and new models, and tap new growth drivers. Third, we hope to translate consensus into action and promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields to continuously achieve new results. Everyone believes that interconnection helps break the bottleneck restricting economic development and is of great significance for enhancing the development momentum of various countries and improving the well-being of the people. International cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road” must continue to focus on interconnection, with major projects and key projects as the lead, promote cooperation in fields such as highways, railways, ports, aviation, oil and gas pipelines, power, and communication networks, and build infrastructure connectivity networks. We decided to continue to actively promote the construction of economic corridors, establish economic and trade, industrial cooperation parks, strengthen international production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, and promote the better and faster development of the real economy. We all value investment and financing cooperation, support the expansion of mutual financial market opening, encourage development financial institutions to play an important role, and strive to build a stable, sustainable, and risk-controllable financial security system. Fourthly, we look forward to building bridges for people-to-people exchanges in various countries to create a better life for the people. We all believe that civilization exchanges and mutual learning are the spiritual wealth left by the ancient Silk Road, and that the common people should become an important part of the ""One Belt and One Road"" international cooperation. We are willing to discuss multi-level and wide-ranging humanities cooperation, strengthen exchanges and cooperation in education, science and technology, culture, health, tourism, sports and other fields, build more cooperation platforms, and open up more cooperation channels. We are willing to actively create conditions for all social strata and groups to participate in cooperation and create a multi-interaction, blooming humanities exchange situation. We will comply with people's expectations and strengthen cooperation in environmental protection, climate change, and anti-corruption. We will also improve visa facilitation measures to make people-to-people exchanges between countries smoother and more comfortable. Fifth, we firmly believe that the “Belt and Road” construction is an open and inclusive development platform, and all countries are equal participants, contributors and beneficiaries. We will adhere to the principle of mutual consultation, co-construction, and sharing with a broad-minded mind, mutual respect, democratic consultation, and joint decision-making, cooperation in openness, and win-win in cooperation. Everyone fully affirmed the role of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum. I would like to announce here that China will host the second “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in 2019. , This summit forum provides a platform for all parties to promote pragmatic cooperation. During the forum, we signed a number of cooperation agreements, reached a number of cooperation projects, and proposed a series of cooperation measures. On this basis, we summarizePlatform. During the forum, we signed a number of cooperation agreements, reached a number of cooperation projects, and proposed a series of cooperation measures. On this basis, we have compiled a list of achievements, which will be released after the closing of the forum. It is believed that these achievements will become a strong support for the construction of the “Belt and Road” international cooperation. , Colleagues! , History always advances along with people's pursuit of a better life. Looking back more than two thousand years ago, our predecessors took such a footstep, relying on perseverance and enterprising spirit, to open up the Silk Road that connects Asia and Europe, and strongly promoted the development and progress of human civilization. Today, the construction of the “Belt and Road” links the peoples of the countries along the route closely and is committed to win-win cooperation and common development, so that people of all countries can better share the fruits of development. This is also an important goal for China to build a community of shared future for mankind. We work together to promote international cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road”, and rejuvenate the ancient Silk Road.

14,47,"[, On April 3, on the eve of a state visit to the Republic of Finland, President Xi Jinping published a signed article entitled ""Friendship through History"" in the Finnish Helsinki Times. The article is as follows:, traversing the friendship of history, President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, in April, the grass and trees first appeared and the spring became stronger. In this beautiful season, at the invitation of President Ninisto, I am very happy to be on a state visit to Finland. , I have visited Finland twice. The pure and beautiful scenery of the forest, the diligent and innovative development concept, and the honest and peaceful humanistic style have left a good impression on me. Finland is at the forefront of the confluence of Eastern and Western civilizations. For centuries, the Finnish people have fought bravely in the turmoil of history, carried forward the tenacious ""Sisu"" spirit, and achieved great achievements in national independence and prosperity. Here was born the symphony master Sibelius, developed the world-renowned Linux operating system, and developed into one of the countries with the highest happiness and integrity index in the world. , This year coincides with the centenary of Finland's independence. I am very happy to share the joy with the people of Finland. China and Finland have similar experiences in modern history and strongly resonate with the national pride of Finland. , China and Finland have friendly feelings for each other. Finland was one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic relations with New China and the first Western country to sign an intergovernmental trade agreement with China. In 1952, Finland, as the host country, invited China to participate in the fifteenth Helsinki Olympics, and the five-star red flag rose for the first time in the Olympic sports arena. In the 1970s, Finland was one of the few Western countries that actively supported China’s restoration of the United Nations legal seat. In 2008, Wenchuan, Sichuan, China was hit by a severe earthquake. The Finnish Red Cross made an emergency donation of nearly 20 tons of materials. Finnair assisted in transporting relief tents donated by various countries for free. Many Finnish companies have achieved great success in the Chinese market, and Sino-Finnish economic, trade and technological cooperation has achieved mutual benefit and win-win results. China has maintained close cooperation with Finland in international affairs for a long time, and supports Finland to play a greater role in international affairs and contribute to world peace and development. The deep feelings of the peoples of the two countries have laid a solid foundation for the development of bilateral relations. Sino-Finnish relations have withstood the test of time and international changes, and have become a model of peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges between countries of different sizes, different cultures, and different levels of development. At present, China and Finland are actively building a new type of future-oriented cooperative partnership, and the relationship between the two countries is facing good development opportunities. China has always viewed China-Finland relations from a strategic height and a long-term perspective, insists on mutual respect and equality, and seeks common development through mutually beneficial cooperation. The Sino-Finnish economic advantages complement each other, and the mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation features are outstanding. China has been Finland’s largest trading partner in Asia for 14 consecutive years, and the two-way investment has grown strongly. China's promotion of the ""Thirteenth Five-Year Plan"" is more consistent with Finland's implementation of the ""2025 Development Vision"". Both sides will show more new highlights in pragmatic cooperation in the fields of innovation and entrepreneurship, clean energy, bioeconomics, and Arctic scientific research. China is actively promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative, and Finland is welcome to participate actively. The personnel exchanges between China and Finland are close, and the cultural exchanges are flourishing. The number of Chinese tourists going to Finland to watch the Northern Lights and visit Santa continues to increase. The ""Happy Chinese New Year"" temple fair has been held in Finland for 11 consecutive years and has become a brand event that many Finnish friends look forward to in the winter. The Helsinki Art Festival Chinese guest of honor event and the ""Hello, Helsinki"" cultural event held in Beijing are welcomed by the people of both countries. China will host the Winter Olympics in 2022. Finland is a world power of ice and snow sports, and there is great potential for cooperation between the two sides. , This visit is my first visit to the Nordic region after becoming the Chinese President. The Nordic economy is developed and active in innovation. China and the Nordic countries have good bilateral relations and sincere willingness to cooperate. The two sides have steadily expanded exchanges and cooperation in various fields. Subregional cooperation is a useful supplement to China-EU relations. I believe that China’s close ties with Northern Europe will contribute to the prosperity of Europe and the development of China-EU relations. At present, the situation in Europe is undergoing profound and complex changes. We believe that European integration follows the trend of historical development, that Europe’s prosperity and stability is conducive to the trend of world peace and development, and believes that Europe has wisdom and ability to overcome challenges. In this process, China is a trusted partner of Europe. , China and the EU are two important forces in the world. At present, the development of China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership is becoming more mature and in-depth, the four partnerships of peace, growth, reform and civilization are being promoted in an all-round way, and the construction of the five major platforms such as the China-EU joint investment fund and interconnection has made positive progress. Both China and Europe are pushing forward structural reforms to promote economic and social development. Both sides connect their respective development strategies, strengthen the integration of interests, and promoteMake positive progress. Both China and Europe are pushing forward structural reforms to promote economic and social development. It is of great significance for the two sides to connect their respective development strategies and strengthen the integration of interests to promote the common growth of China and Europe. Both China and the EU must adhere to the common concept of openness and tolerance and make new contributions to the promotion of world peace and prosperity. The new chapter of history requires the people of all countries to write together. The people of China and Finland should work together and work with people of other countries to create a happier and better tomorrow for mankind!

15,48,"[, On January 13, on the eve of a state visit to Switzerland, attending the 2017 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum and visiting the Swiss International Organization, President Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Swiss media entitled ""Deepening practical cooperation and seeking peaceful development"" . The article is as follows:, deepen pragmatic cooperation and seek for peaceful development. President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China, I am very happy to come to Switzerland as a beautiful country on my first visit in 2017. This is my first visit to Switzerland as the President of China and the first state visit to Switzerland by the Chinese head of state since the new century. , A famous Swiss poet and Nobel Prize winner Spiterer said: ""It is the greatest happiness in the world to find friends who share the same breath and share fate."" During the visit, I will meet with the leaders of the Swiss Federal Council and the Federal Parliament. Make extensive contacts and exchanges with all sectors of society. I will go to Davos to attend the 2017 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum and visit the headquarters of United Nations agencies and international organizations in Geneva and Lausanne. I am looking forward to this trip to Switzerland. (1) Although China and Switzerland are far apart, Switzerland is no stranger to the Chinese people. Switzerland is known as the ""Roof of Europe"" and ""Country of Scientific and Technological Innovation"", with beautiful scenery, hardworking people, and developed economy. The exchanges and cooperation between China and Switzerland have a long history. As early as the beginning of the last century, Swiss watches, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and machinery products have been exported to China, and Swiss financial and insurance institutions are also operating in China. In the 1950s, Switzerland became one of the first Western countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with New China. In 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai headed a delegation to attend the Geneva conference and showed the world the style and characteristics of New China's diplomacy. At the beginning of China's reform and opening up, Swiss companies established the first Sino-foreign joint venture in China. In the new century, Switzerland took the lead among European countries to recognize China's full market economy status. In recent years, Switzerland has become the first continental European country to sign and implement a free trade agreement with China. In terms of supporting RMB internationalization, participating in the creation of an Asian infrastructure investment bank, and mutual exemption of visas for diplomatic passport holders, Sino-Swiss cooperation has shown an innovative spirit of advancing with the times and daring to be a leader, and has played a demonstrative role in Sino-European cooperation. , Sino-Swiss relations maintain a high level of development. Last April, together with the President of the Schneider-Oman Federation who was on a state visit to China, I announced the establishment of a Sino-Swiss innovation strategic partnership. This is the first time China has established a strategic partnership marked by innovation with foreign countries. Sino-Swiss relations have entered a new stage of development. China and Switzerland are good examples of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems, different development stages and different sizes. This is because the peoples of the two countries have friendly feelings for each other, and it is because the two sides respect each other's social system and development path and develop a bilateral relationship based on the spirit of equality and innovation. In the context of the current complex international situation and the weak recovery of the world economy, China and Switzerland work together to deepen the innovative strategic partnership, which can benefit the people of the two countries, promote the development of Sino-European relations, and also contribute to the stable development of today’s international relations and the world. The economic recovery and trade liberalization made positive contributions. Facing the future, our two countries should make efforts in the following aspects. , ——Maintain high-level contacts. Give play to the role of the dialogue and consultation mechanism at all levels of the two countries, and understand and support each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns. , ——Innovative and pragmatic cooperation. Through the establishment of Sino-Swiss high-level innovation cooperation and other platforms, we will promote innovation cooperation between enterprises, universities, and scientific research institutions of the two countries, and expand cooperation in the fields of energy conservation, environmental protection, climate change, intellectual property, finance, ecological agriculture, and social security. Strengthen coordination and cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and international affairs, work together to resolve international disputes peacefully, and inject stability into the international situation. , ——Strengthen humanities exchanges. Taking the opportunity of signing a new Sino-Swiss cultural cooperation agreement, China's establishment of a Chinese cultural center in Bern, and jointly hosting the Sino-Swiss Tourism Year, we will expand exchanges between the people and youth of the two countries, facilitate personnel exchanges between the two countries, and strengthen tourism, winter sports, and careers between the two countries. Cooperation in education, local exchanges and other fields will strengthen the social foundation of Sino-Swiss relations. , ——Perfect Sino-Swiss Free Trade Zone. Actively discuss the upgrading of the Sino-Swiss Free Trade Agreement, give play to its exemplary role, and jointly safeguard the free and open international trade and investment system. Use the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China-CEEC cooperation and other multilateral cooperation platforms to help China and Europe cooperate in the “Belt and Road” initiative. , (2), September 2016, at the beautiful West Lake, at the Hangzhou Summit of the Group of 20 leaders, China and the parties gathered consensus to build an innovative, dynamic, joint and inclusive worldOn the beautiful West Lake, at the Hangzhou Summit of the Group of 20 leaders, China and the parties gathered consensus to inject new impetus into a world economy of innovation, vitality, linkage and inclusiveness. This year, I went to Davos for the first time. I hope to have frank and in-depth exchanges with all parties at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, to increase confidence in responding to challenges, and to promote the recovery of the world economy. , Davos, Switzerland is world famous. At the beginning of the New Year, people from all walks of life from different regions, countries and fields of the world gather here to exchange views, collide with ideas, and attract the attention of the world. Especially since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, the World Economic Forum annual meeting has become an important platform for all parties to brainstorm, dialogue and cooperation. This spirit of working together to overcome difficulties has played a positive role in promoting the recovery of the world economy. At present, people are generally anxious about the prospects for world economic development, anti-economic globalization trends, populism, and trade protectionism have risen significantly, and there are more voices to reflect on and reform the current development path, distribution system, governance model, and the trend of the world economy. Become a common concern of all parties. , China has been working with other countries in the world, including European countries, to explore and cope with the challenges facing global development. We proactively adapt to changes in the external environment and the new normal of China's economic development. Guided by the innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development concept, we promote structural reforms on the supply side, cultivate new growth momentum, and achieve positive results. China will continue to provide huge market space for world economic growth, continue to be a hot spot for investment by all countries, and continue to contribute to the well-being of people of all countries. , (3), Geneva has a decisive position in the history of modern international relations, witnessed the development of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and other intergovernmental international organizations, and provided a phased agreement on important hot issues such as the Iranian nuclear, Syria, and Middle East peace processes The platform has facilitated the adoption of a series of international treaties and legal instruments such as the Geneva Conventions and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In 1971, after resuming its legal seat in the United Nations and returning to the international organization in Geneva, China deeply participated in governance in various fields such as peace, security, development, human rights, and society, and made its own contribution to the noble cause of human peace and development. Through long-term exploration of multilateral diplomatic practices, especially in Geneva, China and other peoples have advocated concepts and principles such as sovereign equality, peaceful reconciliation, rule of law and justice, openness and tolerance, and humanitarianism. These not only reflect the connotation of Geneva's multilateralism, but also the tradition of Chinese diplomacy. This time I visited the United Nations Headquarters in Geneva, I want to review history with all parties, promote the recognized diplomatic concept of all parties, explore the major proposition of building a community of shared future for mankind, and listen to the opinions of all parties on building a better world. The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations in charge of health affairs and has made important contributions to improving global health governance and safeguarding the health of people around the world. Health is not only an important aspect of China's development, but also a key area of ​​China's foreign cooperation. The cooperation between China and the World Health Organization has improved the level of China's health and health undertakings, and also contributed to the global health undertakings. I look forward to fully exchanging views with Director General Chen Fengfuzhen on cooperation between China and the World Health Organization. The International Olympic Movement has gone through more than 100 years and has played a positive role in realizing the all-round development of people, enhancing the friendship between peoples of all countries, and promoting the cause of world peace, development and progress. China has always been an active supporter and participant of the Olympic Movement. It has hosted the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Paralympics and 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympic Games. It is actively preparing for the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games and Winter Paralympics. I am very happy to have the opportunity to visit the International Olympic Committee and listen to the opinions of President Bach and the International Olympic Committee on promoting the Olympic spirit and advancing the Olympic movement. , I look forward to cooperating with all parties in Switzerland to discuss cooperation and discuss innovation, and promote Sino-Swiss relations, Sino-European relations, China's relations with the United Nations, and China's relations with the Olympic Movement to usher in better development in the new year. , (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th),]",Xi Jinping published a signed article in the Swiss media: deepening pragmatic cooperation and seeking peaceful development,2755,来源：人民网-人民日报          发布时间：2017-01-15,"[, 1月13日，在对瑞士进行国事访问、出席世界经济论坛2017年年会并访问瑞士国际组织前夕，国家主席习近平在瑞士媒体发表题为《深化务实合作 共谋和平发展》的署名文章。文章如下：, 深化务实合作 共谋和平发展, 中华人民共和国主席 习近平, 我很高兴2017年第一次出访就来到瑞士这个美丽的国家。这是我首次以中国国家主席身份访问瑞士，也是新世纪以来中国国家元首对瑞士进行的首次国事访问。, 瑞士著名诗人、诺贝尔文学奖获得者施皮特勒说：“找到同呼吸、共命运的朋友是人世间最大的幸福。”访问期间，我将同瑞士联邦委员会、联邦议会领导人会谈会见，同社会各界进行广泛接触和交流。我将赴达沃斯出席世界经济论坛2017年年会，并到日内瓦、洛桑访问联合国机构和国际组织总部。我对这次瑞士之行充满期待。, （一）, 中瑞两国虽然相距遥远，但瑞士对中国人民来说并不陌生。瑞士被誉为“欧洲屋脊”和“科技创新之国”，风光秀美，人民勤劳，经济发达。, 中瑞两国交往合作源远流长。早在上世纪初，瑞士钟表、制药、纺织、机械产品就已经远销中国，瑞士金融保险机构也在华开展业务。, 上世纪50年代，瑞士成为最早承认并同新中国建交的西方国家之一。1954年，周恩来总理率团出席日内瓦会议，向世界展示了新中国外交的风格和特色。, 中国实行改革开放之初，瑞士企业就在华设立了第一家中外合资工业企业。进入新世纪，瑞士在欧洲国家中率先承认中国完全市场经济地位。, 近年来，瑞士成为首个同中国签署并实施自由贸易协定的欧洲大陆国家。在支持人民币国际化、参与创立亚洲基础设施投资银行、互免持外交护照人员签证等方面，中瑞合作展现了与时俱进、敢为人先的创新精神，对中欧合作发挥了示范作用。, 中瑞关系保持高水平发展。去年4月，我同来中国进行国事访问的施奈德—阿曼联邦主席一道，宣布建立中瑞创新战略伙伴关系，这是中国首次同外国建立以创新为标志的战略伙伴关系。中瑞关系进入新的发展阶段。, 中瑞两国是不同社会制度、不同发展阶段、不同大小国家友好合作的典范。这是因为两国人民彼此怀有友好感情，更是因为双方相互尊重各自选择的社会制度和发展道路，秉承平等相待、创新共赢的合作精神发展双边关系。, 在当前国际形势复杂多变、世界经济复苏乏力的背景下，中瑞携手合作，全面深化创新战略伙伴关系，可以造福两国人民、带动中欧关系发展，也可以为当今国际关系稳定发展、世界经济复苏、贸易自由化作出积极贡献。, 面向未来，我们两国要在以下方面作出努力。, ——保持高层交往。发挥两国各层级对话和磋商机制作用，在涉及彼此核心利益和重大关切问题上相互理解和支持。, ——创新务实合作。通过建立中瑞高水平创新合作等平台，推动两国企业、高校、科研机构开展创新合作，拓展节能环保、气候变化、知识产权、金融、生态农业、社会保障等领域合作。加强在联合国等国际组织及国际事务中的协调和合作，共同致力于和平解决国际争端，为国际形势注入稳定因素。, ——加强人文交流。以签署中瑞新的文化合作协议、中国在伯尔尼建立中国文化中心、共同举办中瑞旅游年为契机，扩大两国民间和青年交流，便利两国人员往来，加强两国旅游、冬季运动、职业教育、地方交往等领域合作，巩固中瑞关系社会基础。, ——完善中瑞自由贸易区。积极探讨升级中瑞自由贸易协定，发挥其示范作用，共同维护自由开放的国际贸易和投资体系。利用亚洲基础设施投资银行、中国—中东欧国家合作等多边合作平台，助力中欧“一带一路”合作。, （二）, 2016年9月，在美丽的西子湖畔，在二十国集团领导人杭州峰会上，中方同各方凝聚共识，为构建创新、活力、联动、包容的世界经济注入了新动力。今年，我首次赴达沃斯，希望在世界经济论坛年会上同各方坦诚深入交流，增强应对挑战的信心，推动世界经济恢复增长。, 瑞士达沃斯世界闻名。每逢新年伊始，来自世界不同地区、国家、领域的各界人士在此聚会，交流观点，碰撞思想，吸引着世界的目光。特别是国际金融危机爆发以来，世界经济论坛年会成为各方集思广益、对话合作的重要平台。这种同舟共济、共克时艰的精神为促进世界经济复苏发挥了积极作用。, 当前，人们普遍对世界经济发展前景感到焦虑，反经济全球化思潮、民粹主义、贸易保护主义明显上升，主张对现行发展道路、分配制度、治理模式进行反思和变革的声音增多，世界经济走向成为各方共同关心的问题。, 中国一直同包括欧洲国家在内的世界各国一道，探索应对全球发展面临的挑战。我们主动适应外部环境变化和中国经济发展新常态，以创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念为指引，推进供给侧结构性改革，培育增长新动能，取得积极成效。中国将继续为世界经济增长提供巨大市场空间，继续成为各国投资的热土，继续为增进各国人民福祉作出贡献。, （三）, 日内瓦在近现代国际关系史上具有举足轻重的地位，见证了联合国及其专门机构等政府间国际组织的发展，提供了达成伊朗核、叙利亚、中东和平进程等重要热点问题阶段性协议的平台，促成了《日内瓦公约》、《全面禁止核试验条约》等一系列国际条约和法律文书的通过。, 1971年，中国恢复在联合国合法席位并重返位于日内瓦的国际机构后，深入参与和平、安全、发展、人权、社会等各领域治理，为人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出了自己的贡献。中国和各国人民通过长期探索特别是在日内瓦的多边外交实践，倡导了主权平等、和平和解、法治正义、开放包容、人道主义等理念和原则。这些既体现了日内瓦多边主义精神的内涵，也是中国外交的传统。, 我这次访问联合国日内瓦总部，是想同各方重温历史，弘扬各方公认的外交理念，探索构建人类命运共同体这个重大命题，就建设一个更加美好的世界聆听各方意见。, 世界卫生组织是负责卫生事务的联合国专门机构，为完善全球卫生治理、维护世界人民健康作出了重要贡献。卫生既是中国发展的重要方面，又是中国对外合作的重点领域。中国同世界卫生组织的合作，提升了中国卫生与健康事业水平，也对全球卫生事业作出了贡献。我期待着同陈冯富珍总干事就中国同世界卫生组织合作充分交换意见。, 国际奥林匹克运动走过了100多年的历程，对实现人的全面发展，增进各国人民友谊，推动世界和平、发展、进步事业发挥了积极作用。中国始终是奥林匹克运动的积极支持者和参与者，举办了2008年北京奥运会、残奥会和2014年南京青奥会，正在积极筹办2022年北京冬奥会、冬残奥会。我很高兴有机会访问国际奥委会，听取巴赫主席和国际奥委会关于弘扬奥林匹克精神、推进奥林匹克运动的意见。, 我期待着在瑞士同各方人士共商合作、共议创新，推动中瑞关系、中欧关系、中国同联合国的关系、中国同奥林匹克运动的关系在新的一年迎来更好发展。, （新华社北京1月13日电）, ]",习近平在瑞士媒体发表署名文章:深化务实合作 共谋和平发展,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29023704
16,107,"[, Delegates,, Distinguished Guests,, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Friends:, Law Enforcement Persons from 158 Countries and Regions, Interpol Heads, and Representatives of Related International Institutions Gather in Beijing to Hold Interpol’s 80th The Sixth Plenary Session to discuss international law enforcement and security cooperation plans is of great significance to promoting global security governance and maintaining world security and stability. , 　　 First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I sincerely welcome the arrival of the representatives and guests! Congratulations on the convening of this meeting! , 　　Interpol is the largest international law enforcement cooperation organization with the largest coverage, the largest number of members and the most representative in the world. Interpol has been responsible for enhancing mutual trust and cooperation and promoting world security for nearly a hundred years since its establishment, and has followed the concept of making the world safer. It has played an irreplaceable and important role in consolidating the police consensus of all countries in the world, deepening international law enforcement and security cooperation, and jointly fighting crime. . Since restoring its legal seat in Interpol in 1984, China has strictly abided by the purpose of Interpol and followed the Statutes of Interpol. It has continuously deepened its cooperation with Interpol and its member states in law enforcement and security, and has contributed to maintaining world security and stability. This conference is held in Beijing. I believe it will be a complete success and make new contributions to promoting global security governance and maintaining world security and stability. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends!　　 In today's world, countries are interconnected and interdependent. The global destiny is related to communism and mutual solidarity. Peace, development, cooperation and win-win have never become an irresistible historical trend like today. At the same time, the world today is not peaceful. Global security issues such as terrorism, cybercrime, transnational organized crime, and new types of crime are becoming more prominent. There are endless threats in the security field, and humanity is facing many common challenges. , 　　——The linkage of security issues is more prominent. Security issues are closely related to political, economic, cultural, ethnic, religious and other issues. Non-traditional security threats and traditional security threats are intertwined. A seemingly simple security issue is often not easy to deal with, otherwise it may fall into the predicament of headache and foot pain. Terrorism is a typical example. Its growth and spread are influenced by various complex factors such as economic development, geopolitics, and religious culture. It is impossible to fundamentally solve the problem by a single means. , 　　——The transnational nature of security issues is more prominent. Security issues have already transcended national borders. The security shortcomings of any country will lead to a large influx of external risks and the formation of security risk depressions. The security problems of any country will accumulate to a certain extent and will overflow into regional or even global security issues. All countries can be said to be safe and communal, and they are interdependent, and no country can stay out of it and be alone, nor can any country be able to achieve the so-called absolute security. , 　　——The diversity of security issues is more prominent. The connotation and extension of global security issues are constantly expanding. Traditional crimes are being renewed under the influence of the Internet and new media. New types of crimes such as telecommunications fraud and financial fraud are breeding. Transnational organized crime is escalating. The refugee crisis is intensifying. Cyber ​​attacks 3. Network theft has become a prominent issue that jeopardizes the security of various countries. Various security issues are intertwined and interact with each other, making it more difficult to solve. , 　　 The world today is full of hope and uncertainty, and people are full of expectations and confused about the future. If the security issue is not resolved well, the noble cause of human peace and development will be difficult to advance smoothly. The issue of security is indeed a major issue concerning the future and destiny of mankind, and must be highly valued by all countries and the international community. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 On January 18 this year, I delivered a speech at the United Nations Headquarters in Geneva, showing China's views on promoting world peace and development. The basic point is that all countries should jointly build a community of shared future for mankind to achieve a win-win situation. Achieving the common security of all countries is the proper meaning of the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. To promote peace and development, we must first maintain security and stability; without security and stability, we cannot talk about peace and development. China is willing to work with governments, law enforcement agencies, and international organizations to hold high the banner of cooperation, innovation, rule of law, and a win-win situation, strengthen cooperation in police affairs and security, and jointly build a universally safe community of human destiny. Here, I propose four points. , 　　 First, insist on cooperation and joint construction to achieve lasting security. ""Single is easy to break, while others are indestructible."" To effectively deal with the difficulties and challenges facing humanity, cooperation is our only choice. The destiny of the world should be jointly controlled by all countries, and global affairs should be jointly discussed by all countriesTo the difficulties and challenges facing mankind, cooperation is our only choice. The destiny of the world should be jointly controlled by all countries, and global affairs should be jointly discussed by all countries. In today's world, there is no absolute safe haven. The security issue is two-way and interlocking. It only cares about the security of one country and disregards the security of other countries. At the expense of the security of other countries, it is not only undesirable to seek its own absolute security, but it will eventually harm itself. There is a complete egg under the nest. All countries have equal rights to participate in international and regional security affairs, and all have the responsibility to maintain international and regional security. Large countries have more resources and means, and they should play their role well. At the same time, they must support and encourage other countries, especially developing countries, to participate in global security governance on an equal basis. Countries should establish a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security concept, establish a sense of cooperation in meeting security challenges, seek security and stability through cooperation, promote peace and development through security, and strive to create a lasting safe and stable environment for people of all countries . , 　　 Second, adhere to reform and innovation to achieve joint governance. In today's world, the security situation is very complex, security challenges are emerging one after another, and many new situations and problems have emerged. Faced with these new situations and new problems, the current global security governance system has many unsuitable areas, and it should be reformed and improved to promote the development of the global security governance system in a fairer, more reasonable, and more effective direction. Improving the global security governance system requires the active role of governments and international organizations and specialized forces. It also requires the participation of all sectors of society to continuously improve the integrity and synergy of global security governance. Governments and intergovernmental organizations of various countries should bear the main responsibility of security governance. At the same time, they should encourage non-governmental organizations, multinational companies, and civil society to actively participate to form a joint force in security governance. We must reform and improve the global governance system, use advanced concepts, scientific attitudes, professional methods, and elaborate standards to improve the effectiveness of security governance, focus on promoting the systematic, scientific, intelligent, and rule of law of social governance, and improve various types of prediction, early warning, and prevention Security risk capabilities, increase the predictability, precision and efficiency of security governance. , 　　 Third, uphold the spirit of the rule of law and achieve fairness and justice. More than 2,000 years ago, the ancient Chinese thinker Guan Zhong said: ""The law practitioners, so they have the power to fear violence; the law practitioners, so they set points to stop disputes; the commanders, so they are also sensible."" Is the basic means of modern social governance. To carry out law enforcement and security cooperation between countries, it is necessary to abide by the respective laws and regulations of the two countries, and to ensure that international law is applied equally and uniformly. Double standards must not be pursued, nor can they be used if they are not. Regarding security issues of the same nature, especially counter-terrorism, refugees, epidemic situations, etc., we cannot take a diametrically opposed attitude toward other countries based on our immediate interests. We must uphold and maintain the Charter of the United Nations and the Interpol Constitution, conscientiously implement the convention against transnational crime and the convention against corruption, constantly improve relevant international rules, and ensure that the international order is fair and reasonable and that human society is fair and just. , 　　 Fourth, insist on mutual benefit and win-win situation, and achieve balanced inclusiveness. There are more than 190 countries and regions and more than 7 billion people in the world, and they have become a global village with a shared destiny. You have me in security interests, and you in me. You must abandon the narrow thinking of self-respect, self-harm, self-interest, and neighborliness. All parties should firmly pursue the concept of win-win, multi-win, and win-win, take into account the security of other countries when seeking their own security, and strive to embark on a road of mutual benefit and win-win security. We believe that only if both justice and benefit can be balanced, can both justice and benefit be achieved, and only if the balance between justice and benefit can win both. To establish a correct view of righteousness and benefit, large countries should give greater support to underdeveloped countries and regions in terms of security and development. Only in this way can the achievements of human civilization be better balanced and shared, can international law enforcement cooperation benefit more every country, and the dream of universal security can become a reality as soon as possible. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 We believe that the realization of national development is a contribution to the world, and the realization of national security and stability is also a contribution to the world. Allowing the people to enjoy a safe and stable living and living environment is an important goal of China's governance. In recent years, in the process of continuously advancing economic construction and improving people's living standards, we have continuously promoted the construction of a safe China and a rule of law in China. We have firmly focused on prominent public security issues that affect the people's sense of security, and severely cracked down on and strictly prevented various types of illegal and criminal activities , Comprehensively strengthen the construction of social security prevention and control system, and promote the modernization of social governance system and governance capabilities. At present, Chinese society is stable and orderly, and the people live and work in peace and content. More and more people believe that China is one of the safest countries in the world. This is China's contribution to world security and stability. , 　　 We deeply realize that China needs a safe and stable international environment to develop, and China cannot be in a chaotic worldOut contribution. , 　　 We deeply realize that China needs a safe and stable international environment for development, and China cannot develop in a chaotic world. While managing its own affairs, China has always seriously fulfilled its responsibilities, abided by international rules and obligations, and actively participated in and advocated international law enforcement cooperation and global security governance. China resolutely supports the international anti-terrorist struggle, has carried out in-depth cooperation with more than 70 countries and regions in the fight against cybercrime, proposed an international drug control cooperation plan with shared responsibility and social co-governance, and cooperated with various countries to carry out international law enforcement such as the pursuit of fugitives and the fight against telecommunications fraud Action, fully participating in law enforcement and security cooperation within the framework of international and regional cooperation such as the United Nations, Interpol, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China-ASEAN, etc., creating the law enforcement security cooperation mechanism in the Mekong River Basin, and establishing international law enforcement cooperation in the New Asia-Europe Continental Bridge Security Corridor forum. China firmly supports and actively participates in UN peacekeeping operations. It is the country with the largest number of peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. So far, it has sent 2609 peacekeeping police and peacekeeping riot teams to 9 UN peacekeeping mission areas. On January 12, 2010, eight Chinese peacekeeping police officers were honored and sacrificed in peacekeeping operations in Haiti, and gave their precious lives to safeguard world peace. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China is willing to share the experience of security governance with other countries in the world, and is willing to contribute wisdom and strength to global security governance. China highly commends Interpol’s efforts to maintain world security and stability and will continue to support Interpol’s greater role in global security governance. , 　　Here, I announce that in the next five years, the Chinese government will take the following practical actions to support Interpol. , 　　 First, increase support for Interpol’s global operations and support Interpol’s three global joint operations in the field of counter-terrorism, combating cybercrime, and combating new types of organized crime. , 　　 The second is to increase support for INTERPOL’s law enforcement capacity building, support the establishment of a global training system, train 5,000 law enforcement personnel for developing countries, and assist in building and upgrading INTERPOL communication systems and criminal investigation laboratories for 100 developing countries To promote the balanced development of global police law enforcement capabilities. The Chinese government will establish the International Law Enforcement Academy of the Ministry of Public Security to train 20,000 law enforcement personnel in developing countries. , 　　 The third is to support Interpol to enhance global influence and leadership, support Interpol to recruit 20 middle and senior talents, especially those from developing countries, support Interpol to build strategic research institutions, and establish a martyrdom pension fund. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 The future of mankind is bright, but the bright future will not come automatically. It requires humanity to work together to create. The road to peace and development will not be smooth, and the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind will require unremitting efforts by all countries. China is willing to cooperate closely with and cooperate with member countries, international organizations and institutions, actively participate in global security governance, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of human peace and development! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 26), 　　 ""People's Daily"" (September 27, 2017, 02 edition),]","Xi Jinping: Persist in cooperation, innovation, rule of law and win-win situation, work together to develop global security governance",4018,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-09-27,"[, 各位代表，, 各位嘉宾，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　来自158个国家和地区的执法人士、国际刑警组织负责人、相关国际机构代表相聚北京，举行国际刑警组织第八十六届全体大会，共商国际执法安全合作大计，对推动全球安全治理、维护世界安全稳定具有十分重要的意义。, 　　首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人名义，对各位代表、各位嘉宾的到来表示诚挚的欢迎！对本次会议的召开表示热烈的祝贺！, 　　国际刑警组织是全球覆盖范围最大、成员数量最多、代表性最广的国际执法合作组织。国际刑警组织成立近百年来，以增进互信协作、促进世界安全为己任，遵循让世界更安全的理念，为凝聚世界各国警方共识、深化国际执法安全合作、共同打击犯罪发挥了不可替代的重要作用。中国自1984年恢复在国际刑警组织合法席位以来，恪守国际刑警组织宗旨，遵循国际刑警组织章程，不断深化同国际刑警组织及其成员国警方执法安全合作，为维护世界安全稳定作出了贡献。这次大会在北京召开，相信一定会圆满成功，为推动全球安全治理、维护世界安全稳定作出新贡献。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　当今世界，各国相互联系、相互依存，全球命运与共、休戚相关，和平、发展、合作、共赢从来没有像今天这样成为不可阻挡的历史潮流。同时，当今世界并不太平，恐怖主义、网络犯罪、跨国有组织犯罪、新型犯罪等全球性安全问题愈加突出，安全领域威胁层出不穷，人类面临着许多共同挑战。, 　　——安全问题的联动性更加突出。安全问题同政治、经济、文化、民族、宗教等问题紧密相关，非传统安全威胁和传统安全威胁相互交织。一个看似单纯的安全问题，往往并不能简单对待，否则就可能陷入头痛医头、脚痛医脚的困境。恐怖主义就是典型的例子，其滋生蔓延受经济发展、地缘政治、宗教文化等多种复杂因素影响，单纯靠一种手段无法从根本上解决问题。, 　　——安全问题的跨国性更加突出。安全问题早已超越国界，任何一个国家的安全短板都会导致外部风险大量涌入，形成安全风险洼地；任何一个国家的安全问题积累到一定程度又会外溢成为区域性甚至全球性安全问题。各国可谓安危与共、唇齿相依，没有哪个国家能够置身事外而独善其身，也没有哪个国家可以包打天下来实现所谓的绝对安全。, 　　——安全问题的多样性更加突出。全球安全问题的内涵和外延正在不断拓展，传统犯罪在互联网和新媒体的作用下翻陈出新，电信诈骗、金融诈骗等新型犯罪大量滋生，跨国有组织犯罪日趋升级，难民危机愈演愈烈，网络攻击、网络窃密已经成为危害各国安全的突出问题。各种安全问题相互交织、相互作用，解决起来难度更大。, 　　当今世界既充满希望又充满不确定性，人们对未来既充满期待又感到困惑。安全问题解决不好，人类和平与发展的崇高事业就难以顺利推进。安全问题确实是事关人类前途命运的重大问题，必须引起各国和国际社会高度重视。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　今年1月18日，我在联合国日内瓦总部发表了演讲，表明中国对促进世界和平与发展的看法，基本点就是各国要共同构建人类命运共同体，实现共赢共享。实现各国共同安全，是构建人类命运共同体的题中应有之义。促进和平与发展，首先要维护安全稳定；没有安全稳定，就谈不上和平与发展。中国愿同各国政府及其执法机构、各国际组织一道，高举合作、创新、法治、共赢的旗帜，加强警务和安全方面合作，共同构建普遍安全的人类命运共同体。在这里，我提出4点主张。, 　　第一，坚持合作共建，实现持久安全。“单者易折，众则难摧。”要有效应对人类面临的困难和挑战，合作是我们唯一的选择。世界命运应该由各国共同掌握，全球事务应该由各国共同商量。当今世界，没有绝对安全的世外桃源。安全问题是双向的、联动的，只顾一个国家安全而罔顾其他国家安全，牺牲别国安全谋求自身的所谓绝对安全，不仅是不可取的，而且最终会贻害自己。覆巢之下焉有完卵。各国都有平等参与国际和地区安全事务的权利，也都有维护国际和地区安全的责任。大国具备更多资源和手段，应该发挥好自己的作用，同时要支持和鼓励其他国家特别是广大发展中国家广泛平等参与全球安全治理，大家共同发挥作用。各国应该树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的全球安全观，树立合作应对安全挑战的意识，以合作谋安全、谋稳定，以安全促和平、促发展，努力为各国人民创造持久的安全稳定环境。, 　　第二，坚持改革创新，实现共同治理。当今世界，安全形势十分复杂，安全挑战层出不穷，出现了许多新情况新问题。面对这些新情况新问题，现行全球安全治理体系有很多不适应的地方，应该加以改革完善，推动全球安全治理体系朝着更加公平、更加合理、更加有效的方向发展。完善全球安全治理体系，需要各国政府和国际组织及专门力量发挥积极作用，也需要社会各方面共同参与，不断提高全球安全治理的整体性和协同性。各国政府和政府间组织要承担安全治理的主体责任，同时要鼓励非政府组织、跨国公司、民间社会积极参与，形成安全治理合力。要改革完善全球治理体系，运用先进的理念、科学的态度、专业的方法、精细的标准提升安全治理效能，着力推进社会治理系统化、科学化、智能化、法治化，提高预测预警预防各类安全风险能力，增加安全治理的预见性、精准性、高效性。, 　　第三，坚持法治精神，实现公平正义。2000多年前，中国古代思想家管仲就说：“法者，所以兴功惧暴也；律者，所以定分止争也；令者，所以令人知事也。”法治是人类政治文明的重要成果，是现代社会治理的基本手段。国与国之间开展执法安全合作，既要遵守两国各自的法律规定，又要确保国际法平等统一适用，不能搞双重标准，更不能合则用、不合则弃。对同一性质的安全问题，特别是反恐、难民、疫情等问题，不能根据本国眼前利益对别国采取截然相反的态度。要坚持和维护联合国宪章以及国际刑警组织章程，认真履行打击跨国犯罪公约和反腐败公约，不断完善相关国际规则，确保国际秩序公正合理、人类社会公平正义。, 　　第四，坚持互利共赢，实现平衡普惠。全球有190多个国家和地区、70多亿人口，已经成为休戚与共、命运相连的地球村。安全利益你中有我、我中有你，必须摈弃唯我独尊、损人利己、以邻为壑等狭隘思维。各方应该坚定奉行双赢、多赢、共赢理念，在谋求自身安全时兼顾他国安全，努力走出一条互利共赢的安全之路。我们认为，只有义利兼顾才能义利兼得，只有义利平衡才能义利共赢。要树立正确义利观，大国要在安全和发展上给予不发达国家和地区更大支持。只有这样，人类文明发展成果才能更好实现平衡共享，国际执法合作才能更多惠及每个国家，普遍安全的梦想才能早日成为现实。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　我们认为，实现本国发展是对世界的贡献，实现本国安全稳定也是对世界的贡献。让民众享有一个安全稳定的生存生活环境，是中国治国理政的重要目标。近年来，在不断推进经济建设、提高人民生活水平的进程中，我们不断推进平安中国、法治中国建设，紧紧围绕影响人民群众安全感的突出治安问题，严厉打击、严密防范各类违法犯罪活动，全面加强社会治安防控体系建设，推进社会治理体系和治理能力现代化。当前，中国社会安定有序，人民安居乐业，越来越多的人认为中国是世界上最安全的国家之一。这是中国为世界安全稳定作出的贡献。, 　　我们深刻认识到，中国要发展需要一个安全稳定的国际环境，中国不可能在一个乱哄哄的世界里发展起来。中国在办好自己事情的同时，始终认真履行自己的责任，遵守国际规则，履行国际义务，积极参与并倡导国际执法合作和全球安全治理。中国坚决支持国际反恐怖斗争，先后同70多个国家和地区深度开展打击网络犯罪合作，提出责任共担、社会共治的国际禁毒合作方案，联合各国开展国际追逃追赃、打击电信诈骗等执法行动，全面参与联合国、国际刑警组织、上海合作组织、中国—东盟等国际和区域合作框架内的执法安全合作，创建了湄公河流域执法安全合作机制，建立了新亚欧大陆桥安全走廊国际执法合作论坛。中国坚定支持和积极参与联合国维和行动，是联合国安理会5个常任理事国中派出维和人员最多的国家，迄今为止已向9个联合国维和任务区派出维和警察和维和防暴队共2609人次。2010年1月12日，8名中国维和警察在海地维和行动中光荣牺牲，为维护世界和平献出了宝贵生命。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国愿同世界各国一起分享安全治理的经验，愿为全球安全治理贡献智慧和力量。中国高度赞扬国际刑警组织为维护世界安全稳定作出的努力，将继续支持国际刑警组织在全球安全治理中发挥更大作用。, 　　在这里，我宣布，在未来5年内，中国政府将采取以下实际行动支持国际刑警组织。, 　　一是加大对国际刑警组织全球行动支持力度，支持国际刑警组织在反恐、打击网络犯罪、打击新型有组织犯罪领域每年开展3次全球联合行动。, 　　二是加大对国际刑警组织执法能力建设支持力度，支持建立全球培训体系，为发展中国家培训5000名执法人员；为100个发展中国家援建升级国际刑警组织通信系统和刑事调查实验室，促进全球警方执法能力均衡发展。中国政府将成立公安部国际执法学院，为发展中国家培训2万名执法人员。, 　　三是支持国际刑警组织提升全球影响力和领导力，支持国际刑警组织招聘20名中高级人才特别是发展中国家人才，支持国际刑警组织建设战略研究机构、建立殉职警察抚恤基金。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　人类的前途是光明的，但光明的前途不会自动到来，需要人类齐心协力去开创。和平与发展的道路不会一帆风顺，构建人类命运共同体的目标需要各国为之不懈奋斗。中国愿同广大成员国、国际组织和机构密切配合、通力合作，积极参与全球安全治理，为促进人类和平与发展的崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社北京9月26日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年09月27日 02 版）, ]",习近平：坚持合作创新法治共赢 携手开展全球安全治理,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29561212

In this beautiful season, at the invitation of President Nazarbayev, I will visit Kazakhstan for the third time and attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit and the opening ceremony of the Astana Special Expo. Kazakhstan's vast and magnificent grasslands, winding rivers, ever-changing construction, and warm and simple people have left a deep impression on me. I am about to set foot on this beautiful hot land again, and I am full of anticipation in my heart. This year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan. In this quarter-century, Sino-Kazakh relations have stood the test of time and international changes, from establishing good-neighborly and friendly relations to developing comprehensive strategic partnerships, to building a community of interests and a community of destiny, achieving leapfrog development and reaching history The highest level. , ——China-Kazakhstan political mutual trust is becoming stronger and stronger. The two countries respect each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the chosen development path, firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests, and coordinate and cooperate closely on international and regional issues. , ——Pragmatic cooperation between China and Kazakhstan continues to deepen. China is one of Kazakhstan's most important trading and investment partners, with cumulative investment in Kazakhstan exceeding US$ 42.8 billion and loans exceeding US$ 50 billion. From January to April 2017, the bilateral trade volume increased by 45.6%. Kazakhstan's exports to China are constantly expanding, and flour, vegetable oil, soybeans, meat, and honey are already on the table of ordinary Chinese people. The two sides have identified a total of 51 production capacity cooperation projects, which are of great significance to support the industrialization process of Kazakhstan and expand employment. The China-Kazakhstan crude oil pipeline has accumulated 100 million tons of oil to China, and the China-Kazakhstan natural gas pipeline has accumulated 183 billion cubic meters of gas. China and Kazakhstan are actively discussing new energy cooperation in nuclear power, wind power, and photovoltaics. There are more than 50 flights between the two countries every week. In 2016, the number of China-EU freight trains passing through Kazakhstan in China exceeded 1,200, the railway transportation volume between China and Kazakhstan reached more than 8.2 million tons, and the container traffic volume increased by more than twice. In February of this year, Kazakhstan’s wheat first passed through China’s exports to Southeast Asia. , ——China-Kazakhstan humanities exchanges are closer. In 2016, there were nearly half a million personnel exchanges between the two countries, and 14,000 international students from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan has opened 5 Confucius Institutes and 7 Confucius Classrooms, and 4 Kazakhstan centers have settled in Chinese universities. Kazakhstan singer Dimaxi is well-known in China. Excellent Chinese film and television dramas such as ""China on the Tongue"" and ""Wenzhou Family"" have entered thousands of Kazakhstan families. , In 2013, during my first visit to Kazakhstan, I proposed the initiative to build the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the “Belt and Road” cooperation started. Over the past four years, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” has gradually changed from advocacy to action, from idea to practice, and has become an open and inclusive international cooperation platform and a global public product generally welcomed by the international community. At present, the international situation is profoundly and complicatedly evolving, the world economy is slowly recovering from in-depth adjustments, development problems remain severe, and the construction of the “Belt and Road” has created unprecedented historical opportunities for us. Last month, the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum was successfully held in Beijing. All the participants agreed that through strengthening international cooperation and docking with each other’s development strategies, they will complement each other’s strengths and promote common development. The main task of my visit to Kazakhstan this time is to exchange in-depth views with President Nazarbayev on how to better promote the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Kazakhstan under the new situation, and promote the all-round cooperation and acceleration of China-Kazakhstan comprehensive development. . We sincerely hope that the road of common development and prosperity between China and Kazakhstan will become wider and wider and smoother. ——We will promote the cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road”, accelerate the integration of development strategies, and jointly implement the achievements of the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum. Further release the potential of port, transportation and logistics cooperation, accelerate the construction of the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor and the ""Shuangxi Highway"" project, and promote interconnection and trade facilitation. Explore more flexible and effective investment and financing models, expand bilateral local currency settlement, and provide support for Sino-Kazakh cooperation projects. , ——We want to turn capacity cooperation into a new growth pole for China-Kazakhstan cooperation, speed up the implementation of early harvest projects that have been determined by both parties, continue to give full play to the capacity and investment cooperation dialogue mechanism, maintain effective information communication and policy coordination, and provide enterprises for both countries. Issued in the other countryFor early harvest projects, continue to give full play to the capacity and investment cooperation dialogue mechanism, maintain effective information communication and policy coordination, and create a good business environment for the development of enterprises in the other country. -We must vigorously develop high-tech and innovation cooperation, deepen cooperation in frontier fields such as aerospace, digital economy, and new energy, promote the construction of big data, cloud computing, and smart cities, accelerate cooperation in the field of information technology and e-commerce, and strive to achieve innovation Drive development and promote China-Kazakhstan cooperation towards higher quality. ——We want to build a project of people-to-people communication between China and Kazakhstan, actively promote personnel exchanges and cultural exchanges, and enhance mutual understanding and recognition through mutual establishment of cultural centers, joint establishment of universities, and exchange of film and television literature.

Accelerate the establishment of a bilateral security mechanism for the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, guarantee the safety of oil and gas pipelines and large-scale cooperation projects between the two countries, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and enterprises and the safety of personal property of the two countries. ——We should close cooperation in the international and multilateral fields, strengthen communication and coordination within the multilateral frameworks of the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, AsiaInfo, and exchange opinions on international and regional hot issues in a timely manner. China supports Kazakhstan as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council from 2017 to 2018 to play a greater role in international affairs. , Another important agenda for me in Kazakhstan this time is attending the Astana Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Member States. For a long time, member states have firmly adhered to the purposes and principles determined by these two important documents, promoted the ""Shanghai Spirit"" of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations, and pursued common development, continuously consolidated mutual trust, and steadily promoted cooperation in various fields. It has made important contributions to promoting regional stability and prosperity. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization attaches great importance to security cooperation, has established a cooperation mechanism to combat the ""three forces"", drugs and transnational organized crime, regularly holds joint anti-terrorism exercises, actively promotes the resolution of relevant hotspot issues, and effectively maintains regional security and stability. , Shanghai Cooperation Organization signed and seriously implemented the documents of member countries’ multilateral economic and trade cooperation outline, the organization’s development strategy by 2025, and steadily promoted cooperation in trade, investment, interconnection, energy, finance, agriculture and other fields, and continued to deepen culture, education, youth , Health, science and technology, environmental protection, tourism, sports and other exchanges have provided useful assistance for economic and social development and friendly cooperation between countries. Since Kazakhstan assumed the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, it has made positive contributions to the development of the organization. At the upcoming Astana Summit, the heads of member states will make important decisions on deepening cooperation in various fields and completing the organization’s first expansion process, laying a solid foundation for the organization’s further development. China will take over the rotating presidency after this summit and is willing to work with Kazakhstan and other member states to use the Astana summit as a new starting point to promote the new development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and better benefit the peoples of the region. The 2017 Astana Special World Expo is about to open. This is the first time that Central Asian countries hold the World Expo. The theme of ""Future Energy"" conforms to the trend of green, healthy and sustainable development of the world economy, and is highly consistent with China's initiative to create a ""Green Silk Road"". The Chinese side supports Kazakhstan in organizing the characteristics and level of the Expo. The China Pavilion will showcase the latest technologies such as ""artificial sun"" nuclear fusion and high-speed rail simulation cockpit, and advocate green, low-carbon, circular, sustainable production and living. Ways to contribute Chinese wisdom to the practice of green development. I wish the Astana Special Expo a complete success! Since the independence of Kazakhstan, under the excellent leadership of President Nazarbayev, it has maintained social harmony and stability and rapid economic development, the people’s living standards and happiness index have been significantly improved, the overall national strength has been continuously enhanced, and it ranks among the top 50 global competitiveness. Created the ""Kazakhstan Miracle"". At present, Kazakhstan is leading the third modernization, accelerating the new economic policy of the ""Bright Road"", the ""2050 strategy"", and the modernization reform of social awareness. The people of Kazakhstan are moving towards the ""Kazakhstan"" of national revitalization and national prosperity. ""Stan Dream"" strides forward. The Chinese people are also making unremitting efforts to realize the goal of ""two hundred years"" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The common expectation and common dream will closely connect the people of China and Kazakhstan. The people of the two countries are building dreams together, chasing dreams together and realizing dreams together. , I believe that as long as we are determined to act, China and KazakhstanThe two peoples of Kazakhstan are closely connected, and the two peoples are building dreams together, chasing dreams together and realizing dreams together. , I believe that as long as we are committed to doing so, China-Kazakhstan relations will surely plug in the wings of dreams and fly to a better future! , ""People's Daily"" (June 08, 2017, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping publishes signed articles in Kazakhstan media,3054,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-06-08,"[, 人民网北京6月7日电  （记者周翰博、谢亚宏）6月7日，在对哈萨克斯坦共和国进行国事访问前夕，国家主席习近平在《哈萨克斯坦真理报》发表题为《为中哈关系插上梦想的翅膀》的署名文章。文章如下：, 为中哈关系插上梦想的翅膀, 中华人民共和国主席  习近平, 六月仲夏，万物繁盛。在这美好的季节，应纳扎尔巴耶夫总统邀请，我即将第三次访问哈萨克斯坦，并出席上海合作组织峰会和阿斯塔纳专项世博会开幕式。哈萨克斯坦辽阔壮美的草原、蜿蜒奔腾的河流、日新月异的建设、热情淳朴的人民给我留下深刻印象。即将再次踏上这片美丽的热土，我心中充满期待。, 今年适逢中哈建交25周年。在这四分之一世纪里，中哈关系经受住时间和国际风云变幻考验，从建立睦邻友好关系到发展全面战略伙伴关系，再到打造利益共同体和命运共同体，实现了跨越式发展，达到历史最高水平。, ——中哈政治互信日益牢固。两国尊重对方独立、主权、领土完整和选择的发展道路，在涉及彼此核心利益问题上相互坚定支持，在国际和地区问题上密切协调和配合。, ——中哈务实合作不断加深。中国是哈萨克斯坦最主要的贸易和投资伙伴之一，累计对哈萨克斯坦投资超过428亿美元，贷款超过500亿美元。2017年1—4月，双边贸易额增长45.6%。哈萨克斯坦对华出口不断扩大，面粉、植物油、大豆、肉类、蜂蜜已经走上中国普通百姓餐桌。双方共确定51个产能合作项目，对支持哈萨克斯坦工业化进程和扩大就业具有重要意义。中哈原油管道累计对华输油1亿吨，中哈天然气管道累计对华输气1830亿立方米，双方正积极探讨核电、风电、光伏等新能源合作。每周有50多个航班往来于两国之间。2016年，中国过境哈萨克斯坦的中欧货运班列超过1200列，中哈铁路运输量达820多万吨，集装箱运量大幅增长2倍多。今年2月，哈萨克斯坦小麦首次实现过境中国向东南亚出口。, ——中哈人文交流更加紧密。2016年，两国人员往来近50万人次，哈萨克斯坦在华留学生1.4万人。哈萨克斯坦已开设5所孔子学院和7家孔子课堂，4所哈萨克斯坦中心落户中国高校。哈萨克斯坦歌手迪马希在中国家喻户晓，《舌尖上的中国》、《温州一家人》等中国优秀影视剧走进万千哈萨克斯坦民众家庭。, 2013年，我首次访问哈萨克斯坦期间提出建设丝绸之路经济带倡议，“一带一路”合作由此发端。4年来，共建“一带一路”逐渐从倡议转变为行动，从理念转化为实践，成为开放包容的国际合作平台和受到国际社会普遍欢迎的全球公共产品。, 当前，国际形势深刻复杂演变，世界经济在深度调整中缓慢复苏，发展问题依然严峻，“一带一路”建设为我们创造了前所未有的历史机遇。上个月，“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛在北京成功举行，与会各方一致认为，要通过加强国际合作和对接彼此发展战略，实现优势互补，促进共同发展。, 我这次访问哈萨克斯坦的主要任务，是同纳扎尔巴耶夫总统就新形势下如何更好推进中哈全面战略伙伴关系、推动中哈全方位合作加速发展深入交换意见，作出全面部署。我们真诚希望中哈共同发展繁荣之路越走越宽，越走越顺。, ——我们要推进共建“一带一路”合作，加快发展战略对接，共同落实“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛成果。进一步释放口岸、交通、物流合作潜力，加快新亚欧大陆桥、中国—中亚—西亚经济走廊和“双西公路”项目建设，促进互联互通和贸易便利化。探索更加灵活有效的投资和融资模式，扩大双边本币结算，为中哈合作项目提供支持。, ——我们要将产能合作打造成中哈合作新增长极，加快实施双方已确定的早期收获项目，继续发挥好产能和投资合作对话会机制，保持有效信息沟通和政策协调，为两国企业在对方国家发展营造良好营商环境。, ——我们要大力发展高技术和创新合作，深化航空航天、数字经济、新能源等前沿领域合作，推动大数据、云计算、智慧城市建设，加快信息技术和电子商务领域合作，努力实现创新驱动发展，推动中哈合作向更高质量迈进。, ——我们要打造中哈民心相通工程，更积极推动人员交往和文化交流，通过互设文化中心、联合创办高校、交换影视文学作品等方式增进彼此了解和认同。中方鼓励更多中国公民赴哈萨克斯坦旅游观光，感受“伟大草原之国”独特魅力。, ——我们要深入开展安全合作，践行共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，依法打击“三股势力”、贩毒、跨国有组织犯罪，共同维护网络安全。加快建立共建“一带一路”双边安保机制，保障两国油气管线及大型合作项目安全，保护两国公民和企业合法权益和人身财产安全。, ——我们要密切国际和多边领域合作，加强在联合国、上海合作组织、亚信等多边框架内沟通和协调，及时就国际和地区热点问题交换意见。中方支持哈萨克斯坦作为2017—2018年联合国安理会非常任理事国在国际事务中发挥更大作用。, 我这次在哈萨克斯坦的另一项重要日程是出席上海合作组织阿斯塔纳峰会。今年是《上海合作组织宪章》签署15周年和《上海合作组织成员国长期睦邻友好合作条约》签署10周年。长期以来，成员国坚定遵循这两份重要文件确定的宗旨和原则，弘扬互信、互利、平等、协商、尊重多样文明、谋求共同发展的“上海精神”，不断巩固互信，扎实推进各领域合作，为促进地区稳定和繁荣作出了重要贡献。, 上海合作组织高度重视安全合作，建立了打击“三股势力”、毒品及跨国有组织犯罪的合作机制，定期举行联合反恐演习，积极推进有关热点问题解决，有效维护了地区安全和稳定。, 上海合作组织签署和认真落实成员国多边经贸合作纲要、本组织至2025年发展战略等文件，稳步推进贸易、投资、互联互通、能源、金融、农业等领域合作，不断深化文化、教育、青年、卫生、科技、环保、旅游、体育等方面交流，为各国经济社会发展和相互友好合作提供了有益助力。, 哈萨克斯坦担任上海合作组织轮值主席国以来，为推动本组织发展作出了积极贡献。在即将举行的阿斯塔纳峰会上，成员国元首将就深化各领域合作以及完成本组织首次扩员进程作出重要决定，为本组织下一步发展奠定坚实基础。中方将在本次峰会后接任轮值主席国，愿同哈方及其他成员国一道努力，以阿斯塔纳峰会为新起点，推动上海合作组织实现新发展，更好造福地区各国人民。, 2017阿斯塔纳专项世博会即将开幕，这是中亚国家首次举办世博会，“未来能源”主题顺应世界经济绿色、健康、可持续发展潮流，同中方打造“绿色丝绸之路”倡议高度契合。, 中方支持哈萨克斯坦将这次世博会办出特色、办出水平，中国馆将展示“人造太阳”核聚变、高铁模拟驾驶舱等最新技术，倡导绿色、低碳、循环、可持续的生产和生活方式，为践行绿色发展理念贡献中国智慧。我预祝阿斯塔纳专项世博会取得圆满成功！, 哈萨克斯坦独立以来，在纳扎尔巴耶夫总统卓越领导下，保持社会和谐稳定和经济快速发展，人民生活水平和幸福指数显著提高，综合国力不断增强，跻身全球竞争力50强之列，创造了“哈萨克斯坦奇迹”。, 当前，哈萨克斯坦正以第三次现代化为引领，加快推进“光明之路”新经济政策、“2050战略”、社会意识现代化改革，哈萨克斯坦人民正朝着实现民族振兴、国家富强的“哈萨克斯坦梦”阔步前进。中国人民也在为实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标和中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而不懈努力。共同的期盼、共同的梦想将中哈两国人民紧密连接在一起，两国人民正同心筑梦，并肩追梦，携手圆梦。, 我相信，只要我们矢志笃行，中哈关系必将插上梦想的翅膀，飞向更加美好的未来！, 《 人民日报 》（ 2017年06月08日 01 版）, ]",习近平在哈萨克斯坦媒体发表署名文章 为中哈关系插上梦想的翅膀,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29325185

19,136,"[, Dear leaders of political parties of various countries,, Ladies and gentlemen, friends: Good afternoon, everyone! Today, I am very happy to have the opportunity to attend the high-level dialogue between the Chinese Communist Party and the world’s political parties with leaders of political parties and political organizations from all over the world. At the end of the year and the end of the year, everyone was busy with their work. They still spared valuable time to gather in Beijing to discuss cooperation plans, which fully reflected everyone's concern for human development and the future of the world. , 　　 Here, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to friends from all over the world coming from afar! When the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was convened, many political parties and organizations and their leaders sent letters and calls to congratulate them. I would like to use today's opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone! , 　　 The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China planned China's blueprint for development from now to the middle of this century, and declared China's sincere desire to work with all parties to build a community of shared future for mankind. Political parties play an important role in the political life of the country and are also an important force for the advancement of human civilization. Everyone here is the leader of nearly 300 political parties and organizations from all over the world. I would like to share our experience with you. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Throughout the ages, living a happy and beautiful life has always been the dream of human beings. In the history of civilization development for thousands of years, mankind has created splendid civilization achievements, but wars and conflicts have never stopped, coupled with various natural disasters and disease plagues, mankind has experienced countless hardships and paid a terrible price. Today, with the rapid development of the Internet, big data, cloud computing, quantum satellites, and artificial intelligence, the connection of human life is unprecedented. At the same time, the number, scale, and depth of global problems facing humanity are unprecedented. The future and destiny of the peoples of the world are more and more closely linked. , 　　 Faced with this situation, human beings have two choices. One is that people compete for power and gain vicious competition and even meet each other, which is likely to bring a catastrophic crisis. The other is that people follow the development trend of the times, work together to meet challenges, and carry out global collaboration, which will create favorable conditions for the construction of a community of human destiny. We must seize historical opportunities, make the right choices, and jointly create a brighter future for mankind. , 　　The Chinese nation has a long history and a splendid civilization, but it has suffered through blood and fire since modern times. The Chinese people did not succumb to their destiny, but they fought and struggled to become stronger. After a long struggle, they have embarked on a grand road to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Looking back on history, what supports our ancient nation to this day and what has supported the Chinese civilization for more than 5,000 years is the cultural genes rooted in the deep blood of the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation has always emphasized ""one family in the world"", advocating the commonality of the people, harmonizing all nations, and the world, and looking forward to the beautiful world of ""travel on the road, the world is the public."" We believe that despite all the differences and contradictions among countries in the world, it is inevitable that such bumps and bumps will occur, but people of all countries in the world live under the same blue sky and own the same home, and should be a family. People of all countries in the world should uphold the concept of ""one family in the world"", open arms, understand each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and work together to build a community of shared future for mankind. , 　　 In 2013, I first proposed an initiative to build a community of human destiny. I am glad to see that the friendly cooperation between China and other countries in the world continues to expand, and the concept of a community of shared future for mankind has received more and more support and approval from people. , 　　 I put forward the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, is to implement the concept of the community of human destiny. Over the past four years, the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” has become a huge cooperation platform for all countries to achieve common development. The trickle flows into the sea, and a little star lights up the galaxy. I am convinced that as long as all parties establish the concept of a community of human destiny, plan together, and practice together, bit by bit, persevere and work tirelessly, the goal of building a community of human destiny will be achieved. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends!　　Community of human destiny, as the name implies, is that the future and destiny of each nation and country are closely linked, and we should work together in the same wind and rain, and work together to make the planet we were born in and grow in a harmonious family. Turn people's longing for a better life into reality. , 　　——We must work hard to build a world that is free from fear and generally safe. Throughout the development of human civilization, although mankind has been hoping for permanent peace for thousands of years, war has never been far away, and mankind has always faced the threat of war. Human beings live on the same earth, the security of one country cannot be built on the insecurity of other countriesHowever, war has never been far away, and mankind has always faced the threat of war. Human beings live on the same earth. The security of one country cannot be built on the insecurity of other countries. The threats faced by other countries may also become challenges for their own countries. In the face of increasingly complex and comprehensive security threats, it is impossible to fight alone, and superstition is not enough. We should adhere to a new security concept that is common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, create a fair and just security, build a shared security pattern, jointly eliminate the root causes of war, jointly rescue the people driven by guns, and jointly protect women who are burned by war Children, let the sun shine on the earth, let everyone enjoy peace and tranquility. , 　　——We must strive to build a world free from poverty and common prosperity. In today’s world, the level of material technology has developed to a point unimaginable by the ancients, but the problem of imbalanced development is still widespread, the gap between North and South development is still huge, poverty and hunger are still serious, a new digital divide is forming, and there are still many in the world. People in many countries live in predicament. If you follow the old logic of losing and winning, and the winner-take-all, if you adopt the old method of cheating and taking advantage of your neighbors, the result will inevitably be to close the door of others and to block your own way, eroding the foundation of your own development, What harms the future of all mankind. We should adhere to the concept of hello, hello, everyone, and promote open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win economic globalization, create good conditions for the common development of all mankind, jointly promote the development and prosperity of all countries in the world, and eliminate the people of many countries. Still facing poverty and backwardness, we work together to create a carefree life for children around the world, let the fruits of development benefit all countries in the world, and let everyone enjoy prosperity and well-being. , 　　-We must strive to build a world that is far from closed, open and inclusive. There is an old Chinese saying: ""Everything is bred without harming each other, and the ways are parallel but not contradictory."" The prosperity of civilization and the progress of mankind are inseparable from seeking common ground while reserving differences, being open and inclusive, and inseparable from civilization exchange and mutual learning. History calls for the glory of human civilization. Different civilizations should coexist in harmony and complement each other to provide spiritual power for human development. We should adhere to the idea that the world is rich and colorful and civilizations are diverse, let the various civilizations created by human beings shine together, weave colorful pictures, and jointly eliminate the cultural barriers in real life, and jointly resist the concept of hindering the interaction of human souls. To jointly break down the spiritual barriers that hinder human interaction, allow various civilizations to coexist in harmony, and let everyone enjoy cultural nourishment. , 　　——We must strive to build a beautiful, clean and beautiful world. The earth is the common home of mankind and the only home of mankind so far. Now, someone is looking for a new home for humanity in outer space, but this is still a distant dream. In the foreseeable future, humanity will all live on earth. This is an immutable fact. We should take good care of the earth homeland for ourselves and for future generations. We should adhere to the concept of symbiosis and coexistence between man and nature, treat the ecological environment like life, respect the nature, respect nature, adapt to nature, protect nature, jointly protect the irreplaceable home of the earth, and heal the scars of the ecological environment. Together to create a harmonious and livable human home, let the natural ecology rest and rejuvenate, let everyone enjoy the green water and green mountains. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, the world pattern is changing and the development pattern is changing. All political parties must follow the trend of the times, grasp the trend of human progress, meet the common expectations of the people, and closely integrate their own development with the development of the country, nation, and humanity. We should be ambitious, dare to take responsibility, focus on our country and the world, focus on the overall situation and long-term, and consciously shoulder the mission of the times. We should deeply understand the people's sentiments, transform the needs of the people into the party's ideas, objectives, and goals, and formulate practical implementation plans. Building a community with a shared future for mankind requires universal participation of people from all over the world. We should gather the consensus of people of different nationalities, different beliefs, different cultures, and different regions, and work together to build the great cause of a community of shared future for mankind. , 　　Realize the great dream requires all aspects of wisdom and strength. We should brainstorm ideas from all angles, levels, and angles, sum up experience from practice, seek ideas, sublimate ideas, and gain motivation. Political parties in different countries should increase mutual trust, strengthen communication, and cooperate closely, explore the establishment of a new type of political party relationship that seeks common ground while reserving differences, respects, and learns from each other on the basis of a new type of international relations, and builds various forms and levels of international political party exchanges and cooperation The network brings together a powerful force that builds a community of human destiny. , 　　 things must be done in order to achieve a career, the road must go to open the way. Building a community of human destiny is a historical process. It cannot be accomplished overnight or smoothly, and it requires long and arduous efforts. In order to construct. Building a community of human destiny is a historical process. It cannot be accomplished overnight or smoothly, and it requires long and arduous efforts. In order to build a community with a shared future for mankind, we should persevere and work hard. We must not give up our dreams because of the complexity of reality, nor can we give up our pursuits because of distant ideals. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 The Communist Party of China is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and a party striving for human progress. The Communist Party of China is the largest political party in the world. As I said, big is like big. All the Chinese Communist Party does is to seek happiness for the Chinese people, to revive the Chinese nation, and to seek peace and development for mankind. We need to do our own thing well, which itself is a contribution to building a community of shared future for mankind. We must also create more opportunities for the world by promoting China's development, explore the laws of human social development by deepening our own practices, and share them with other countries in the world. We do not ""import"" the foreign model, nor ""export"" the Chinese model, and will not require other countries to ""copy"" China's practice. The Communist Party of China will always do the following. , 　　 First, as always, contribute to the world and peace. Nearly 100 years ago, the Communist Party of China was born in the turmoil of Chinese society. One of its tasks at the time of its establishment was to end the tragic situation of frequent wars and people’s lack of livelihood in China since the mid-19th century. From 1921 to 1949, in order to achieve peace and stability in China and live and work in peace and contentment for the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people in armed struggle for 28 years and made tremendous sacrifices. Therefore, the Chinese Communists know the value of peace and have the firm determination to maintain peace. China will hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and win-win results, will continue to pursue the path of peaceful development, actively promote the construction of global partnerships, and actively participate in the political resolution process of international hot and difficult issues. At present, China has accumulatively sent more than 36,000 peacekeepers to become the main troop-contributing country and capital-contributing country to UN peacekeeping operations. At this moment, more than 2,500 Chinese officers and soldiers are in the 8 peacekeeping mission areas, defying hardship and danger, and maintaining local peace and tranquility. China will actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system and promote the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and reasonable direction. No matter how far China develops, it will never dominate and never expand. We propose that political parties from all over the world join us in being a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. , 　　 Second, as always, contribute to the common development of the world. The Communist Party of China has come from the people and relied on the development and growth of the people. It has always had a deep feeling for the people, not only for the Chinese people, but also for the people of all countries in the world. It is not only willing to benefit the Chinese people, but also for the people of the world. benefit. For a long time, China has provided a large amount of free assistance, preferential loans, a large number of technical support, personnel support, and intellectual support for developing countries, and has built a large number of economic and social development and livelihood improvement projects for the developing countries. Today, thousands of Chinese scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, technicians, medical staff, teachers, ordinary employees, volunteers, etc. are struggling hand in hand with the local people on the vast land of many developing countries. Help them change their destiny. According to the arrangements of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China will fully build a moderately prosperous society by 2020, by 2035 China will basically realize socialist modernization, and by the middle of this century, China will be a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful socialist modern power. This will benefit the Chinese people as well as the people of all countries in the world. We propose that political parties from all over the world join us to create more opportunities for cooperation in the world and strive to promote the common development and prosperity of all countries in the world. , 　　 Third, as always, contribute to the exchange of mutual knowledge between the civilizations of the world. Stones from other hills, can learn. The Communist Party of China has always emphasized setting a world perspective, actively learning from the civilization achievements created by the people of all countries in the world, and applying them in light of China's reality. Marxism is the scientific truth learned by Chinese Communists from abroad. Combining with China's reality, we continue to advance the popularization of Marxism in China and make it a scientific theory that guides the Communist Party of China to lead the Chinese people to continue to advance. The Communist Party of China will treat the civilization and creation of the people of all countries in the world with an open mind and an open mind. It is willing to carry out dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with people and political parties of all countries in the world, and supports people of all countries to strengthen humanistic exchanges and non-governmental friendship. In the next five years, the Communist Party of China will provide political parties from all over the world with an opportunity to communicate with 15,000 people in China. We propose to institutionalize the high-level dialogue between the Chinese Communist Party and the world’s political parties to make it a high-end political dialogue platform with broad representation and international influence. ,   LadiesThe high-level dialogue between the Communist Party and the world's political parties has been institutionalized, making it a high-end political dialogue platform with broad representation and international influence. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 More than 2000 years ago, ancient Chinese thinker Confucius said that the three friends of the beneficiary are straight, friendly and understandable. The Chinese Communist Party is willing to make friends all over the world. For a long time, the Communist Party of China has maintained regular contacts with more than 400 political parties and political organizations in more than 160 countries and regions in the world, and the ""friend circle"" has been continuously expanding. Facing the future, the Communist Party of China is willing to strengthen contacts with political parties around the world, share the experience of ruling the party and the country, carry out civilized exchanges and dialogues, enhance mutual strategic trust, work with people around the world to promote the construction of a community of shared future for mankind, and build a better world together! , 　　 Finally, I wish the high-level dialogue between the Chinese Communist Party and the world's political parties a complete success! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December

parties,4790,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-12-02,"[, 尊敬的各国政党领导人，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　大家下午好！今天，有机会同来自世界各国的政党和政治组织领导人一起出席中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会，我感到十分高兴。年终岁末，大家工作都很繁忙，仍抽出宝贵时间齐聚北京，共商合作大计，充分体现了大家对人类发展和世界前途的关心。, 　　在这里，我谨代表中国共产党，并以我个人的名义，向远道而来的各国朋友表示热烈的欢迎！中共十九大召开时，很多政党和政治组织及其领导人来信来电表示祝贺，我愿利用今天的机会，向大家表示衷心的感谢！, 　　中共十九大规划了中国从现在到本世纪中叶的发展蓝图，宣示了中方愿同各方推动构建人类命运共同体的真诚愿望。政党在国家政治生活中发挥着重要作用，也是推动人类文明进步的重要力量。在座各位是来自世界各国近300个政党和政治组织的领导人。我愿同大家分享我们的心得。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　古往今来，过上幸福美好生活始终是人类孜孜以求的梦想。在几千年文明发展史上，人类创造了灿烂的文明成果，但战争和冲突从未间断，加上各种自然灾害、疾病瘟疫，人类经历了无数的苦难，付出了惨痛的代价。今天，互联网、大数据、云计算、量子卫星、人工智能迅猛发展，人类生活的关联前所未有，同时人类面临的全球性问题数量之多、规模之大、程度之深也前所未有。世界各国人民前途命运越来越紧密地联系在一起。, 　　面对这种局势，人类有两种选择。一种是，人们为了争权夺利恶性竞争甚至兵戎相见，这很可能带来灾难性危机。另一种是，人们顺应时代发展潮流，齐心协力应对挑战，开展全球性协作，这就将为构建人类命运共同体创造有利条件。我们要抓住历史机遇，作出正确选择，共同开创人类更加光明的未来。, 　　中华民族拥有悠久历史和灿烂文明，但近代以后历经血与火的磨难。中国人民没有向命运屈服，而是奋起抗争、自强不息，经过长期奋斗，而今走上了实现中华民族伟大复兴的康庄大道。回顾历史，支撑我们这个古老民族走到今天的，支撑5000多年中华文明延绵至今的，是植根于中华民族血脉深处的文化基因。中华民族历来讲求“天下一家”，主张民胞物与、协和万邦、天下大同，憧憬“大道之行，天下为公”的美好世界。我们认为，世界各国尽管有这样那样的分歧矛盾，也免不了产生这样那样的磕磕碰碰，但世界各国人民都生活在同一片蓝天下、拥有同一个家园，应该是一家人。世界各国人民应该秉持“天下一家”理念，张开怀抱，彼此理解，求同存异，共同为构建人类命运共同体而努力。, 　　2013年，我首次提出构建人类命运共同体的倡议。我高兴地看到，中国同世界各国的友好合作不断拓展，人类命运共同体理念得到越来越多人的支持和赞同，这一倡议正在从理念转化为行动。, 　　我提出“一带一路”倡议，就是要实践人类命运共同体理念。4年来，共建“一带一路”已成为有关各国实现共同发展的巨大合作平台。涓涓细流汇成大海，点点星光点亮银河。我深信，只要各方树立人类命运共同体理念，一起来规划，一起来实践，一点一滴坚持努力，日积月累不懈奋斗，构建人类命运共同体的目标就一定能够实现。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　人类命运共同体，顾名思义，就是每个民族、每个国家的前途命运都紧紧联系在一起，应该风雨同舟，荣辱与共，努力把我们生于斯、长于斯的这个星球建成一个和睦的大家庭，把世界各国人民对美好生活的向往变成现实。, 　　——我们要努力建设一个远离恐惧、普遍安全的世界。纵观人类文明发展进程，尽管千百年来人类一直期盼永久和平，但战争从未远离，人类始终面临着战火的威胁。人类生存在同一个地球上，一国安全不能建立在别国不安全之上，别国面临的威胁也可能成为本国的挑战。面对日益复杂化、综合化的安全威胁，单打独斗不行，迷信武力更不行。我们应该坚持共同、综合、合作、可持续的新安全观，营造公平正义、共建共享的安全格局，共同消除引发战争的根源，共同解救被枪炮驱赶的民众，共同保护被战火烧灼的妇女儿童，让和平的阳光普照大地，让人人享有安宁祥和。, 　　——我们要努力建设一个远离贫困、共同繁荣的世界。今天的世界，物质技术水平已经发展到古人难以想象的地步，但发展不平衡不充分问题仍然普遍存在，南北发展差距依然巨大，贫困和饥饿依然严重，新的数字鸿沟正在形成，世界上还有很多国家的民众生活在困境之中。如果奉行你输我赢、赢者通吃的老一套逻辑，如果采取尔虞我诈、以邻为壑的老一套办法，结果必然是封上了别人的门，也堵上了自己的路，侵蚀的是自己发展的根基，损害的是全人类的未来。我们应该坚持你好我好大家好的理念，推进开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的经济全球化，创造全人类共同发展的良好条件，共同推动世界各国发展繁荣，共同消除许多国家民众依然面临的贫穷落后，共同为全球的孩子们营造衣食无忧的生活，让发展成果惠及世界各国，让人人享有富足安康。, 　　——我们要努力建设一个远离封闭、开放包容的世界。中国有句古话：“万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。”文明的繁盛、人类的进步，离不开求同存异、开放包容，离不开文明交流、互学互鉴。历史呼唤着人类文明同放异彩，不同文明应该和谐共生、相得益彰，共同为人类发展提供精神力量。我们应该坚持世界是丰富多彩的、文明是多样的理念，让人类创造的各种文明交相辉映，编织出斑斓绚丽的图画，共同消除现实生活中的文化壁垒，共同抵制妨碍人类心灵互动的观念纰缪，共同打破阻碍人类交往的精神隔阂，让各种文明和谐共存，让人人享有文化滋养。, 　　——我们要努力建设一个山清水秀、清洁美丽的世界。地球是人类的共同家园，也是人类到目前为止唯一的家园。现在，有人正在外太空为人类寻找新的家园，但这还是一个遥远的梦想。在可预见的将来，人类都要生活在地球之上。这是一个不可改变的事实。我们应该共同呵护好地球家园，为了我们自己，也为了子孙后代。我们应该坚持人与自然共生共存的理念，像对待生命一样对待生态环境，对自然心存敬畏，尊重自然、顺应自然、保护自然，共同保护不可替代的地球家园，共同医治生态环境的累累伤痕，共同营造和谐宜居的人类家园，让自然生态休养生息，让人人都享有绿水青山。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　当前，世界格局在变，发展格局在变，各个政党都要顺应时代发展潮流、把握人类进步大势、顺应人民共同期待，把自身发展同国家、民族、人类的发展紧密结合在一起。我们应该志存高远、敢于担当，着眼本国和世界，着眼全局和长远，自觉担负起时代使命。我们应该深入体察民情，把民众需求转化为政党的理念、宗旨、目标，制定符合实际的实施方案。构建人类命运共同体，需要世界各国人民普遍参与。我们应该凝聚不同民族、不同信仰、不同文化、不同地域人民的共识，共襄构建人类命运共同体的伟业。, 　　实现伟大梦想需要各方面智慧和力量。我们应该全方位、多层次、多角度集思广益，从实践中总结经验、寻找思路、升华思想、获取动力。不同国家的政党应该增进互信、加强沟通、密切协作，探索在新型国际关系的基础上建立求同存异、相互尊重、互学互鉴的新型政党关系，搭建多种形式、多种层次的国际政党交流合作网络，汇聚构建人类命运共同体的强大力量。, 　　事要去做才能成就事业，路要去走才能开辟通途。构建人类命运共同体是一个历史过程，不可能一蹴而就，也不可能一帆风顺，需要付出长期艰苦的努力。为了构建人类命运共同体，我们应该锲而不舍、驰而不息进行努力，不能因现实复杂而放弃梦想，也不能因理想遥远而放弃追求。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国共产党是为中国人民谋幸福的党，也是为人类进步事业而奋斗的党。中国共产党是世界上最大的政党。我说过，大就要有大的样子。中国共产党所做的一切，就是为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴、为人类谋和平与发展。我们要把自己的事情做好，这本身就是对构建人类命运共同体的贡献。我们也要通过推动中国发展给世界创造更多机遇，通过深化自身实践探索人类社会发展规律并同世界各国分享。我们不“输入”外国模式，也不“输出”中国模式，不会要求别国“复制”中国的做法。中国共产党将始终做到以下几条。, 　　第一，一如既往为世界和平安宁作贡献。将近100年前，中国共产党在中国社会的剧烈动荡中诞生，成立时的任务之一就是结束中国从19世纪中叶起陷入的战乱频仍、民不聊生的悲惨境地。从1921年到1949年，为实现中国和平稳定、中国人民安居乐业，中国共产党团结带领中国人民进行了长达28年的武装斗争，付出了巨大牺牲。所以，中国共产党人深知和平的可贵，也具有维护和平的坚定决心。中国将高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，始终不渝走和平发展道路，积极推进全球伙伴关系建设，主动参与国际热点难点问题的政治解决进程。目前，中国累计派出3.6万余人次维和人员，成为联合国维和行动的主要出兵国和出资国。此时此刻，2500多名中国官兵正在8个维和任务区不畏艰苦和危险，维护着当地和平安宁。中国将积极参与全球治理体系改革和建设，推动国际政治经济秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。中国无论发展到什么程度，都永远不称霸，永远不搞扩张。我们倡议世界各国政党同我们一道，做世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者。, 　　第二，一如既往为世界共同发展作贡献。中国共产党从人民中走来、依靠人民发展壮大，历来有着深厚的人民情怀，不仅对中国人民有着深厚情怀，而且对世界各国人民有着深厚情怀，不仅愿意为中国人民造福，也愿意为世界各国人民造福。长期以来，中国为广大发展中国家提供了大量无偿援助、优惠贷款，提供了大量技术支持、人员支持、智力支持，为广大发展中国家建成了大批经济社会发展和民生改善项目。今天，成千上万的中国科学家、工程师、企业家、技术人员、医务人员、教师、普通职工、志愿者等正奋斗在众多发展中国家广阔的土地上，同当地民众手拉手、肩并肩，帮助他们改变命运。根据中共十九大的安排，到2020年中国将全面建成小康社会，到2035年中国将基本实现社会主义现代化，到本世纪中叶中国将建成富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国。这将造福中国人民，也将造福世界各国人民。我们倡议世界各国政党同我们一道，为世界创造更多合作机会，努力推动世界各国共同发展繁荣。, 　　第三，一如既往为世界文明交流互鉴作贡献。他山之石，可以攻玉。中国共产党历来强调树立世界眼光，积极学习借鉴世界各国人民创造的文明成果，并结合中国实际加以运用。马克思主义就是中国共产党人从国外学来的科学真理。我们结合中国实际，不断推进马克思主义中国化时代化大众化，使之成为指导中国共产党领导中国人民不断前进的科学理论。中国共产党将以开放的眼光、开阔的胸怀对待世界各国人民的文明创造，愿意同世界各国人民和各国政党开展对话和交流合作，支持各国人民加强人文往来和民间友好。未来5年，中国共产党将向世界各国政党提供1.5万名人员来华交流的机会。我们倡议将中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会机制化，使之成为具有广泛代表性和国际影响力的高端政治对话平台。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　2000多年前，中国古代思想家孔子就说，益者三友，友直、友谅、友多闻。中国共产党愿广交天下朋友。长期以来，中国共产党同世界上160多个国家和地区的400多个政党和政治组织保持着经常性联系，“朋友圈”不断扩大。面向未来，中国共产党愿同世界各国政党加强往来，分享治党治国经验，开展文明交流对话，增进彼此战略信任，同世界各国人民一道，推动构建人类命运共同体，携手建设更加美好的世界！, 　　最后，祝中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会圆满成功！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社北京12月1日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年12月02日 02 版）, ]",习近平在中国共产党与世界政党高层对话会上的主旨讲话,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29681332
20,137,"[, 　　 On November 10, President Xi Jinping was invited to attend the APEC Business Leaders Summit held in Da Nang, Vietnam and delivered a keynote speech entitled ""Seizing the Opportunities of World Economic Transformation and Seeking Greater Development in the Asia-Pacific"".　　 Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yeshe, Mr. Wu Jinlu,, representatives of the Asia-Pacific industry and commerce, ladies and gentlemen, friends:, 　　 Hello everyone! It is a pleasure to come to Da Nang and meet again with friends from the Asia-Pacific business community. , 　　 Asia-Pacific is the largest sector of the global economy and a major engine of world economic growth. The business community is a new force promoting economic growth and an explorer and practitioner of new development concepts. In the past few years, every time I attended the APEC Leaders’ Informal Meeting, I took the time to meet friends from the business community to discuss ideas and measures to deal with current challenges. , 　　 In the 10 years since the international financial crisis, the international community has worked together to push the world economy back to recovery. Today, we are ushering in a gradual improvement in the world economy. Although still facing risks and uncertainties, global trade and investment are picking up, financial markets are expected to improve, and the confidence of all parties has increased significantly. , 　　The road to development has no end, only a new starting point. ""The past can't be admired, but the comer can still be chased."" The world is in a rapidly changing historical process, and the world economy is undergoing deeper changes. We must have an insight into the development trend of the world economy, find a correct position, grasp the law, and dare to respond. , 　　——We are facing a profound transformation of growth momentum. At present, reform and innovation have become the direction for all countries to resolve challenges and seek development. The positive effects and potential of structural reforms have been continuously released, and the promotion of economic growth in various countries has become more apparent. A new round of technology and industrial revolutions is gaining momentum, the digital economy and the sharing economy are accelerating, new industries, new models, and new formats are emerging, and new growth momentum is constantly accumulating. , 　　——We are facing a profound transformation of the global development mode. With the progress of the times, the connotation of development is undergoing profound changes. The development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing is gaining popularity among the people, and achieving more comprehensive, more quality and more sustainable development is the goal pursued by the international community. Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and addressing global challenges such as climate change has become an important consensus of the international community. , 　　——We are facing a profound transformation in the process of economic globalization. Over the past few decades, economic globalization has made important contributions to world economic development and has become an irreversible trend of the times. At the same time, in the face of developments and changes in the situation, economic globalization is facing new adjustments in form and content. The concept should focus more on openness and tolerance, the direction should pay more attention to inclusive balance, and the effect should pay more attention to fair and win-win. , 　　——We are facing a profound transformation of the global economic governance system. The evolution of the world economic pattern has put forward higher requirements for the global economic governance system. Adhering to multilateralism, seeking mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, establishing close partnerships, and building a community of shared future for mankind are inevitable trends in global economic governance under the new situation. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 Faced with the profound changes in the world economy, is Asia-Pacific courageously standing in the tide of reform and innovation, or is hesitant to hover? Should we take the initiative to guide economic globalization to move forward, or hesitate in the face of challenges? Should we work together to open up new prospects for regional cooperation, or should we move away from each other? , 　　 The answer is clear. We must follow the general trend, be courageous, and work together to open up a bright future for Asia-Pacific development and prosperity. , 　　 First, continue to build an open economy and strive to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. Openness brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind. Asia-Pacific economies have a profound experience of this through their own development practices. We must work hard to create a regional cooperation framework of equal consultation, broad participation, and universal benefit, work together to build an open Asia-Pacific economy, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We must guide economic globalization in a direction that is more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and mutually beneficial, benefiting different countries, different strata, and different people. We must take the initiative to adapt to changes in the global industrial division of labor, actively lead the reshaping of the global value chain, establish a new positioning, and build new advantages. We must support the multilateral trading system, adhere to open regionalism, and help developing members benefit more from international trade and investment. , 　　 The establishment of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area is the dream of the Asia-Pacific business community for many years. In 2006, precisely at the appeal of the business community, the leaders of APEC members established the vision of building the Asia-Pacific free trade zone for the first time in Hanoi. In 2014, we launched the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Zone process in Beijing. We should actFor the first time, the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Zone was established as a long-term goal. In 2014, we launched the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Zone process in Beijing. We should take action to fully implement the Beijing road map in an in-depth manner, and continue to move towards the goal of establishing an Asia-Pacific free trade zone, so as to provide institutional guarantee for an open Asia-Pacific economy. , 　　 Second, continue to seek innovative growth and tap new development momentum. At present, the world economy is stabilizing, cyclical factors have played a large role, and the persistent illness with insufficient internal energy has not been eliminated. The world economy is completely free from the risks of ""new mediocrity"" and can only ask for innovation. , 　　 We are ushering in a new round of technological and industrial revolution, the digital economy and the sharing economy are setting off a wave worldwide, and new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum science are constantly making breakthroughs. Asia-Pacific cannot wait and see. We should seize opportunities, increase investment in innovation, change the mode of development, and cultivate new economic growth points. It is necessary to actively promote structural reforms, eliminate all institutional and institutional obstacles that are not conducive to innovation, and stimulate market vitality. It is necessary to implement the ""Consensus of Economic Innovation Development, Reform and Growth"" of the Beijing Conference, deepen cooperation between the Internet and the digital economy, and lead the direction of global innovation and development. , 　　 Third, continue to strengthen interconnection and interconnection to achieve joint development. Linked development is the best interpretation of the concept of mutual benefit and win-win. The interests of Asia-Pacific economies are blended and closely linked. Adhering to joint development can not only provide development momentum for partners, but also create greater development space for itself. In 2014, we formulated the APEC Connectivity Blueprint. We must use the blueprint as a guide to establish a comprehensive, multi-level, and complex Asia-Pacific interconnection network. It is necessary to give full play to the radiating and leading role of interconnection in the real economy, break the development bottleneck, release the development potential, and form a coordinated and coordinated development pattern. , 　　 In May this year, the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum was successfully held in Beijing. The core connotation of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative is to promote infrastructure construction and interconnection, strengthen economic policy coordination and development strategy docking, promote coordinated and joint development, and achieve common prosperity. This initiative originated in China and belongs to the world; it is rooted in history and more oriented to the future; it focuses on Asia, Europe and Africa, and is open to all partners. I believe that the in-depth advancement of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative will provide a broader and more dynamic platform for cooperation among all parties in the Asia-Pacific region! , 　　 Fourth, continue to enhance the inclusiveness of economic development and allow the people to share development achievements. At present, the process of economic globalization is facing headwinds. An important reason is the lack of tolerance for development. To enable different countries and different strata to enjoy the development dividend and make a beautiful vision a reality, we still need to make unremitting efforts. , 　　 In the past few years, we have actively explored inclusive development and have a solid consensus basis. We must combine the in-depth advancement of regional economic integration, expand the open and inclusive market, and strengthen the chain of benefit sharing. We must integrate the concept of inclusiveness and sharing into our development strategy, strive to improve the efficiency-oriented, fair-focused systems and mechanisms, and maintain social fairness and justice. We must increase investment in the areas of people's livelihood, such as education, medical care, and employment, to solve problems such as poverty and widening income gap. We must increase support for vulnerable groups, improve the development environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, and enhance the ability of workers to adapt to industrial changes, so that everyone has opportunities and enjoys results! , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　The ancient Chinese said, ""It must be said in words."" To achieve greater development in the Asia-Pacific region, every member needs to take action in a down-to-earth manner. As the second largest economy in the world, China is well aware of its responsibilities. In the past five years, we have actively adapted, grasped, and led the new normal of the economy, deepened the supply-side structural reforms, maintained the stability of the economy, progressed steadily, and promoted China’s development towards higher quality, efficiency, and fairness. And move towards a more sustainable direction. In the past four years, the average growth rate of the Chinese economy has been 7.2%, and the average contribution rate to the world economic growth has exceeded 30%, becoming the main source of power for the world economy. , 　　Through comprehensively deepening reforms, we broke through the obstacles to institutional mechanisms that hindered development, launched 360 major reform programs, and more than 1,500 reform measures. A number of important areas and key links have achieved breakthrough progress in reform, and the main framework for reform in the main areas has been basically established. We accelerate the construction of a new open economic system, transform foreign trade and investment methods, and continue to promote the expansion of foreign trade from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement. , 　　 We comprehensively promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation and other aspects of innovation, and constantly release new growth momentum. China is becoming a broad platform for various innovation factors to exert their agglomeration effect, regardless of infrastructure or economic format, regardless of business model or consumption mode, they are bursting with surging momentum of innovation. , 　　 We deeply implement the people as the centerInfrastructure or economic format, regardless of business model or consumption mode, burst out surging momentum of innovation. , 　　 We deeply implement the people-centered development thinking and strive to enhance the inclusiveness and sharing level of development. Residents' income continued to grow rapidly and outperformed the GDP of the same period for many years. The income distribution gap between urban and rural areas has continued to narrow, the middle-income group has continued to expand, and the Gini coefficient has declined. The annual increase in urban employment has remained above 13 million for four consecutive years. Significant results have been achieved in green development, the intensity of energy resource consumption has dropped significantly, and ecological environment governance has been significantly strengthened. , 　　Getting all poor people out of poverty is a commitment made by the Chinese government to the people, and it is also the thing I care about the most and spend the most energy. In the past five years, I have visited many poor areas of the country, with the aim of identifying the root causes of poverty and proposing effective measures. China has made decisive progress in the fight against poverty. In the past five years, more than 60 million poor people have stably lifted out of poverty, the incidence of poverty has continued to decline, and the per capita income of rural residents in poor areas has maintained double-digit growth. This achievement is hard-won, and we are proud of it. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 China's development is a historical process. Last month, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was successfully held in Beijing. The conference focused on the people's longing for a better life, and formulated the action plan and development blueprint for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. In 2020, China will fully build a well-off society. By 2035, China will basically realize socialist modernization. By the middle of this century, China will become a powerful modern socialist country with prosperity, democracy, civilization, harmony, and beauty. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people will start a new journey. , 　　 First, this is a new journey to comprehensively deepen reform and continuously release development vitality. The key to solving the difficulties and problems on the way forward lies in comprehensively deepening reform. We will strengthen problem orientation, resolutely eliminate all untimely ideological concepts and institutional defects, break through the barriers of solidified interests, and stimulate the creativity and development vitality of the whole society. We will build a system with complete systems, scientific norms, and effective operation, and continuously promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities. Next year, we will commemorate the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China's reforms will have wider fields, more initiatives and stronger efforts. , 　　 Second, this is a new journey of advancing with the times and innovating the development mode. The Chinese economy has shifted from a stage of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. We will implement the new development concept, adhere to quality first, benefit first, and build a modern economic system. We will focus on supply-side structural reforms, promote economic development quality reforms, efficiency reforms, and power reforms, improve total factor productivity, focus on accelerating the construction of an industrial system with real economy, technological innovation, modern finance, and human resources coordinated development, and focus on building An economic system with an effective market mechanism, a viable micro-subject, and a moderate macro-control system has continuously enhanced economic innovation and competitiveness. We will promote the in-depth integration of the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence and the real economy, and foster new growth momentum in the digital economy, sharing economy, clean energy and other fields. We will continue to explore new mechanisms and new paths for regional coordinated development, vigorously promote the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, build the Xiong'an New District, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, build a world-class urban agglomeration, and create a new economic growth pole. , 　　 A country with a faster pace of innovation and better quality of development, new economic formats are constantly emerging, innovation results are accelerated and applied, and the coordinated development of regional economies will produce a broader and stronger radiation effect, bring more opportunities for cooperation, let More countries take the express train developed by China.　　Third, this is a new journey towards the world and the development of a higher level of open economy. The pace of China's opening up will not stop. We will work with other countries to further advance the construction of the “Belt and Road” and add new momentum for common development. We will implement a high-level trade and investment liberalization and facilitation policy, fully implement the pre-access national treatment plus negative list management system, substantially relax market access, expand the opening up of the service industry, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investment. All companies registered in China will be treated equally and equally. We will give the free trade pilot zone greater autonomy to reform and explore the construction of a free trade port. We will accelerate the signing of free trade agreements and investment agreements with relevant countries, promote the construction of the Asia-Pacific free trade zone, and promote the conclusion of negotiations on regional comprehensive economic partnership agreements as soon as possible, and build a global free trade zone network. , 　　 In the next 15 years, the Chinese market will further expand and development will be more comprehensive. It is estimated that 24 trillion US dollars of commodities will be imported and 2 trillion US dollars of foreign direct investment will be absorbed, and the total foreign investment will reach 2 trillion US dollars. In November next year, we will hold the first edition in ShanghaiFor US dollar commodities, foreign direct investment of 2 trillion US dollars will be absorbed, and the total foreign investment will reach 2 trillion US dollars. In November next year, we will hold the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai, which will build a new platform for all parties to cooperate in opening up the Chinese market. , 　　 Fourth, this is a new journey towards a better life with the people at the center. Letting the people live a good life is the starting point and ending point of all our work. We will insist on ensuring and improving people's livelihood during development, continuously satisfying the people's growing needs for a better life, and constantly promoting social fairness and justice, so that people's sense of well-being, happiness, and security will be more complete, more secure, and more sustainable. We will continue to promote targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation to achieve the goal of poverty alleviation by the rural poor under the current standards in my country by 2020. Building a well-off society in an all-round way, there are more than 1.3 billion Chinese people, no one can do less! , 　　 We will accelerate the reform of the ecological civilization system, adhere to the path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development, and implement the strictest ecological environmental protection system. By 2035, China's ecological environment will fundamentally improve, and the goal of beautiful China will basically be achieved. We will actively respond to climate change and protect the common homeland on which humanity depends. China's carbon dioxide emissions will peak around 2030 and strive to reach the peak as soon as possible. Non-fossil energy will account for about 20% of primary energy consumption. As long as it is the right thing, we will continue to work tirelessly!　　 Fifth, this is a new journey to promote the construction of a new type of international relations and a community of shared future for mankind. The dreams of the Chinese people are closely linked to the dreams of people of all countries. The world today is full of challenges, and the road ahead will not be smooth, but we will not give up our ideal pursuit, and will work together with all parties to build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty. , 　　 The Chinese people stress peace and harmony. We will stick to the path of peaceful development and always be the anchor of peace and stability in the world and the Asia-Pacific region. We will uphold the concept of righteousness and benefit, actively develop global partnership, expand the convergence of interests with other countries, and promote the establishment of a new international relationship of mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation. We will uphold the concept of mutual consultation, joint construction and sharing, actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system, and promote the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and reasonable direction. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends!　　Peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific belong to all the people of Asia-Pacific, and the future of Asia-Pacific depends on the people of Asia-Pacific to create together. The partnership of mutual trust, tolerance, cooperation and win-win is the spiritual bond of the Asia-Pacific family and an important guarantee for ensuring that Asia-Pacific cooperation is on the right track. Let us push forward cooperation on a down-to-earth basis and take solid actions to jointly build a better tomorrow for the Asia-Pacific! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency, Da Nang, Vietnam,

　　亚太是全球经济最大的板块，也是世界经济增长的一个主要引擎。工商界是促进经济增长的生力军，是新发展理念的探索者、实践者。这几年，每次出席亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议，我都抽出时间同工商界的朋友见面，共同探讨应对当前挑战的思路和举措。, 　　国际金融危机发生10年来，国际社会一起努力，推动世界经济逐步回到复苏的轨道。今天，我们迎来了世界经济逐步向好的局面。尽管仍然面临风险和不确定性，但全球贸易和投资回暖，金融市场预期向好，各方信心显著增强。, 　　发展之路没有终点，只有新的起点。“往者不可谏，来者犹可追。”世界正处在快速变化的历史进程之中，世界经济正在发生更深层次的变化。我们要洞察世界经济发展趋势，找准方位，把握规律，果敢应对。, 　　——我们正面临增长动能的深刻转变。当前，改革创新成为各国化解挑战、谋求发展的方向。结构性改革的正面效应和潜能持续释放，对各国经济增长的促进作用进一步显现。新一轮科技和产业革命形成势头，数字经济、共享经济加速发展，新产业、新模式、新业态层出不穷，新的增长动能不断积聚。, 　　——我们正面临全球发展方式的深刻转变。随着时代进步，发展的内涵正在发生深刻变化。创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念日益深入人心，实现更加全面、更有质量、更可持续的发展，是国际社会共同追求的目标。落实2030年可持续发展议程，应对气候变化等全球性挑战，成为国际社会重要共识。, 　　——我们正面临经济全球化进程的深刻转变。过去数十年，经济全球化对世界经济发展作出了重要贡献，已成为不可逆转的时代潮流。同时，面对形势的发展变化，经济全球化在形式和内容上面临新的调整，理念上应该更加注重开放包容，方向上应该更加注重普惠平衡，效应上应该更加注重公正共赢。, 　　——我们正面临全球经济治理体系的深刻转变。世界经济格局的演变对全球经济治理体系提出了更高要求。坚持多边主义，谋求共商共建共享，建立紧密伙伴关系，构建人类命运共同体，是新形势下全球经济治理的必然趋势。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　面对世界经济的深刻转变，亚太在改革创新大潮中是勇立潮头，还是迟疑徘徊？是主动引导经济全球化继续前行，还是在挑战面前犹豫不定？是携手开辟区域合作新局面，还是各自渐行渐远？, 　　答案是清楚的，我们必须顺应大势，勇于担当，共同开辟亚太发展繁荣的光明未来。, 　　第一，继续坚持建设开放型经济，努力实现互利共赢。开放带来进步，封闭必然落后。亚太经济体通过自身发展实践，对这一点有着深刻体会。我们要努力打造平等协商、广泛参与、普遍受益的区域合作框架，合力构建开放型亚太经济，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化。我们要引导经济全球化朝着更加开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的方向发展，造福不同国家、不同阶层、不同人群。我们要主动适应全球产业分工调整变化，积极引领全球价值链重塑，确立新定位，构筑新优势。我们要支持多边贸易体制，坚持开放的区域主义，帮助发展中成员更多从国际贸易和投资中受益。, 　　建成亚太自由贸易区是亚太工商界多年的梦想。2006年，正是在工商界呼吁下，亚太经合组织成员领导人在河内首次把建设亚太自由贸易区确立为远景目标。2014年，我们在北京启动亚太自由贸易区进程。我们应该行动起来，全面深入落实北京路线图，向着建成亚太自由贸易区的目标不断迈进，为开放型亚太经济提供机制保障。, 　　第二，继续谋求创新增长，挖掘发展新动能。当前，世界经济回稳，周期性因素发挥了很大的作用，内生动能不足的顽疾并未消除。世界经济彻底摆脱“新平庸”的风险，只能向创新要动力。, 　　我们正迎来新一轮科技和产业革命，数字经济、共享经济在全球范围内掀起浪潮，人工智能、量子科学等新技术不断取得突破，亚太不能等待和观望。我们应该抢抓机遇，加大创新投入，转变发展方式，培育新的经济增长点。要积极推进结构性改革，消除一切不利于创新的体制机制障碍，激发市场活力。要落实好北京会议《经济创新发展、改革与增长共识》，深化互联网和数字经济合作，引领全球创新发展的方向。, 　　第三，继续加强互联互通，实现联动发展。联动发展是对互利共赢理念的最好诠释。亚太经济体利益交融，联系紧密。坚持联动发展，既能为伙伴提供发展动力，也能为自身创造更大发展空间。2014年，我们制定完成了亚太经合组织互联互通蓝图。我们要以蓝图为指引，建立全方位、多层次、复合型的亚太互联互通网络。要充分发挥互联互通对实体经济的辐射和带动作用，打破发展瓶颈，释放发展潜力，形成协调联动发展的格局。, 　　今年5月，“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛在北京成功举办。共建“一带一路”倡议的核心内涵，就是促进基础设施建设和互联互通，加强经济政策协调和发展战略对接，促进协同联动发展，实现共同繁荣。这一倡议源自中国，更属于世界；根植于历史，更面向未来；重点面向亚欧非大陆，更向所有伙伴开放。我相信，共建“一带一路”倡议的深入推进，将为亚太各方提供更加广阔、更有活力的合作平台！, 　　第四，继续增强经济发展包容性，让民众共享发展成果。当前，经济全球化进程遭遇逆风，一个重要原因是发展的包容性不足。让不同国家、不同阶层都能享受发展红利，让美好的愿景变为现实，仍需要作出不懈努力。, 　　过去几年，我们围绕包容发展进行了积极探索，有了坚实的共识基础。我们要结合区域经济一体化的深入推进，做大开放普惠的市场，做强利益共享的链条。我们要把包容共享理念融入发展战略，努力健全讲求效率、注重公平的体制机制，维护社会公平正义。我们要在教育、医疗、就业等民生领域加大投入，解决好贫困、收入差距拉大等问题。我们要加大对弱势群体的扶持力度，改善中小微企业发展环境，增强劳动者适应产业变革的能力，让人人拥有机遇，享有成果！, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国古人说：“口言之，身必行之。”实现亚太更大发展，需要每个成员脚踏实地拿出行动。作为全球第二大经济体，中国深知自身肩负的责任。过去5年，我们主动适应、把握、引领经济新常态，深入推进供给侧结构性改革，保持经济稳中向好、稳中有进，推动中国发展不断向着更高质量、更有效率、更加公平、更可持续的方向迈进。过去4年，中国经济平均增长率为7.2%，对世界经济增长的平均贡献率超过30%，成为世界经济的主要动力源。, 　　我们通过全面深化改革破除妨碍发展的体制机制障碍，推出360个重大改革方案、1500多项改革举措，一批重要领域和关键环节改革取得突破性进展，主要领域改革主体框架基本确立。我们加快构建开放型经济新体制，转变对外贸易和投资方式，继续推动对外贸易由量的扩张转向质的提升。, 　　我们全方位推进理论创新、实践创新、制度创新、文化创新以及其他各方面创新，不断释放增长新动能。中国正成为各种创新要素发挥集聚效应的广阔平台，不论基础设施还是经济业态，不论商业模式还是消费方式，都迸发出创新的澎湃动能。, 　　我们深入贯彻以人民为中心的发展思想，努力提升发展的包容性和共享水平。居民收入持续较快增长，连续多年跑赢同期国内生产总值。城乡区域收入分配差距持续缩小，中等收入群体持续扩大，基尼系数下降，每年新增城镇就业已连续4年保持1300万人以上。绿色发展取得显著成效，能源资源消耗强度大幅下降，生态环境治理明显加强。, 　　让所有贫困人口脱贫，是中国政府对人民作出的承诺，也是我牵挂最多、花精力最多的一件事情。过去5年，我走访了全国很多贫困地区，目的是找准致贫的根源，提出管用的举措。中国脱贫攻坚战取得决定性进展。5年来，又有6000多万贫困人口稳定脱贫，贫困发生率持续下降，贫困地区农村居民人均收入保持两位数增长。这一成果来之不易，我们为之感到自豪。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　中国的发展是一个历史进程。上个月，中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会在北京胜利召开。大会聚焦人民对美好生活的向往，制定了新时代中国特色社会主义的行动纲领和发展蓝图。2020年，中国将全面建成小康社会。到2035年，中国将基本实现社会主义现代化。到本世纪中叶，中国将建成富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国。在中国共产党领导下，中国人民将开启新征程。, 　　第一，这是全面深化改革、持续释放发展活力的新征程。解决前进道路上的困难和问题，关键在于全面深化改革。我们将强化问题导向，坚决破除一切不合时宜的思想观念和体制机制弊端，突破利益固化的藩篱，激发全社会创造力和发展活力。我们将构建系统完备、科学规范、运行有效的制度体系，不断推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化。明年，我们将隆重纪念改革开放40周年。中国改革的领域将更广、举措将更多、力度将更强。, 　　第二，这是与时俱进、创新发展方式的新征程。中国经济已经由高速增长阶段转向高质量发展阶段。我们将贯彻新发展理念，坚持质量第一、效益优先，建设现代化经济体系。我们将以供给侧结构性改革为主线，推动经济发展质量变革、效率变革、动力变革，提高全要素生产率，着力加快建设实体经济、科技创新、现代金融、人力资源协同发展的产业体系，着力构建市场机制有效、微观主体有活力、宏观调控有度的经济体制，不断增强经济创新力和竞争力。我们将推动互联网、大数据、人工智能和实体经济深入融合，在数字经济、共享经济、清洁能源等领域培育新的增长动能。我们将不断探索区域协调发展新机制新路径，大力推动京津冀协同发展、长江经济带发展，建设雄安新区、粤港澳大湾区，建设世界级城市群，打造新的经济增长极。, 　　一个创新步伐加快、发展质量更优的中国，经济新业态不断涌现，创新成果加快转化应用，区域经济实现协同发展，将产生更广泛、更强大的辐射效应，带来更多合作机会，让更多国家搭乘中国发展的快车。, 　　第三，这是进一步走向世界、发展更高层次开放型经济的新征程。中国对外开放的脚步不会停滞。我们将同各国一道，深入推进“一带一路”建设，增添共同发展新动力。我们将实行高水平的贸易和投资自由化便利化政策，全面实行准入前国民待遇加负面清单管理制度，大幅度放宽市场准入，扩大服务业对外开放，保护外商投资合法权益。凡是在中国境内注册的企业，我们都会一视同仁、平等对待。我们将赋予自由贸易试验区更大改革自主权，探索建设自由贸易港。我们将加快同有关国家商签自由贸易协定和投资协定，推动建设亚太自由贸易区，推动区域全面经济伙伴关系协定谈判尽早结束，构建面向全球的自由贸易区网络。, 　　未来15年，中国市场将进一步扩大，发展将更加全面。预计将进口24万亿美元商品，吸收2万亿美元境外直接投资，对外投资总额将达到2万亿美元。明年11月，我们将在上海举办首届中国国际进口博览会，这将为各方进行开辟中国市场的合作搭建新平台。, 　　第四，这是以人民为中心、迈向美好生活的新征程。让人民过上好日子，是我们一切工作的出发点和落脚点。我们将坚持在发展中保障和改善民生，不断满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要，不断促进社会公平正义，使人民获得感、幸福感、安全感更加完善、更有保障、更可持续。我们将持续推进精准扶贫、精准脱贫，实现到2020年我国现行标准下农村贫困人口脱贫的目标。全面建成小康社会，13亿多中国人，一个都不能少！, 　　我们将加快生态文明体制改革，坚持走绿色、低碳、可持续发展之路，实行最严格的生态环境保护制度。到2035年，中国的生态环境将根本好转，美丽中国目标将基本实现。我们将积极应对气候变化，保护好人类赖以生存的共同家园。中国二氧化碳排放将于2030年左右达到峰值并争取尽早达峰，非化石能源占一次能源消费比重将达到20%左右。只要是认准了的事情，我们都会坚持不懈做下去！, 　　第五，这是推动构建新型国际关系、推动构建人类命运共同体的新征程。中国人民的梦想同各国人民的梦想息息相通。当今世界充满挑战，前面的道路不会平坦，但我们不会放弃理想追求，将以更大的作为，同各方携手建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界。, 　　中国人民讲求以和为贵、协和万邦。我们将坚持走和平发展道路，始终做世界和亚太地区的和平稳定之锚。我们将秉持正确义利观，积极发展全球伙伴关系，扩大同各国的利益汇合点，推动建设相互尊重、公平正义、合作共赢的新型国际关系。我们将秉持共商共建共享理念，积极参与全球治理体系改革和建设，推动国际政治经济秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　亚太的和平、稳定、繁荣属于全体亚太人民，亚太的未来要靠亚太人民携手创造。互信、包容、合作、共赢的伙伴关系，是亚太大家庭的精神纽带，是确保亚太合作处在正确轨道上的重要保障。让我们脚踏实地推进合作，扎扎实实采取行动，共同建设亚太更加美好的明天！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社越南岘港11月10日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年11月11日 02 版）, ]",抓住世界经济转型机遇 谋求亚太更大发展,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29639925
21,138,"[, Dear President Temer, President Zuma, Dear representatives of industry and commerce,, Ladies and gentlemen, friends: Good afternoon! 　　I am very happy to be here with you in Xiamen, a scenic ""Lulu Island"". Tomorrow, the meeting of BRICS leaders will begin. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, on behalf of the citizens of Xiamen, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all the guests who attended the meeting! , 　　 Since ancient times, Xiamen has been a port of trade and affluence, and it is also a gateway to open cooperation. I came to Fujian to work in 1985, Xiamen was the first stop. At the time, Xiamen was at the forefront of China's reform and opening up. It was a special economic zone that was first tried, and it was also a hot spot for development. After more than 30 years of spring and rain, Xiamen today has developed into a city of high-quality innovation and entrepreneurship. The new economy and new industries are developing rapidly. Today's Xiamen is also a high-value ecological garden city, where people and nature live in harmony. , 　　The people of southern Fujian often say, ""Love will win"". This contains a spirit of determination and forging ahead. The successful practice of this city of Xiamen reflects the history of more than 1.3 billion Chinese people striving for self-improvement. In the past 40 years of reform and opening up, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have successfully embarked on a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, with their enthusiasm for opening roads in the mountains and bridging water and bridging water. We have encountered difficulties, we have encountered challenges, but we have worked tirelessly, advancing with the times, and used hard work, bravery, and wisdom to write the story of the development and progress of contemporary China. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 BRICS cooperation is at the key node of succession and succession. Observing the BRICS cooperation and development, two dimensions are very important. One is to put BRIC cooperation in the historical process of world development and the evolution of the international landscape. The second is to put BRIC cooperation in the historical process of the five countries' respective and common development. , 　　 Now, we are in an era of great development, big change and big adjustment. Although conflicts and poverty have not been eradicated globally, the era of peace and development has become stronger. World multi-polarization, economic globalization, cultural diversity, and social informatization have developed in depth. The jungle rule of weak meat and strong food, the zero-sum game of winning and losing is no longer in line with the logic of the times. Peace, development, cooperation, and win-win situation have become common for all peoples. voice. Under such a large background, a large number of emerging market countries and developing countries have sprung up, playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. BRICS cooperation also came into being, and our five countries came together with the common desire to pursue peace and development. In the past 10 years, BRICS countries have joined hands to grow into a new bright spot in the world economy. , 　　——In the past 10 years, the BRICS countries have explored progress and sought common development. The sudden international financial crisis that broke out in 2008 directly caused the world economy to brake, which has not been able to get back on track. In the face of sudden changes in the external environment, our five nations have set foot in the country and concentrated on developing the economy and improving people's livelihood. In the past 10 years, the total economic growth of the five countries has increased by 179%, the total trade volume has increased by 94%, and the urbanization population has increased by 28%. It has made outstanding contributions to the stabilization and recovery of the world economy, and has given more than 3 billion people a real sense of gain. , 　　 ——In the past 10 years, the BRICS countries have been pragmatic and promote mutually beneficial cooperation. Our five countries have leveraged their complementary advantages, tightened their interest ties, established a comprehensive and multi-level cooperation framework led by leaders, and a number of cooperation projects have emerged that are in line with the development strategies of the five countries and in the interests of the people of the five countries. In particular, the establishment of the New Development Bank and emergency reserve arrangements have provided financing support for infrastructure construction and sustainable development in the BRICS countries, and have made useful explorations for improving global economic governance and building an international financial safety net. , 　　——In the past 10 years, the BRICS countries have dared to act and strive to make a difference on the international stage. Our five countries uphold multilateralism, advocate fairness and justice, and speak out and propose proposals on major international and regional issues. Our five countries have actively promoted global economic governance reforms to enhance the representation and voice of emerging market countries and developing countries. Our five countries hold high the banner of development, take the lead in implementing the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals, strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the vast number of developing countries, and seek joint self-improvement. , 　　The high-rise building rises to the ground. Nowadays, the foundation of BRICS cooperation has been laid, and the outline of the overall architecture is emerging. Looking back on the future, I think three revelations are very important and should be carried forward in future cooperation. , 　　 First, treat each other as equals, seek common ground while reserving differences. The BRICS countries don't make a speech, and everyone discusses everything. Five of usCarry forward in future cooperation. , 　　 First, treat each other as equals, seek common ground while reserving differences. The BRICS countries don't make a speech, and everyone discusses everything. Our five countries respect each other's development path and model, care for each other's concerns, and are committed to enhancing strategic communication and political mutual trust. Our five countries have differences in national conditions, history, culture and other aspects. It is inevitable that we will encounter some differences in cooperation. However, as long as we are firm in our belief in cooperation and persist in increasing trust and dispelling doubts, we will become more stable on the road of cooperation. , 　　 Second is pragmatic innovation, win-win cooperation. The BRICS countries are not a busy talk hall, but an action team that unites knowledge and action. Our five countries are pursuing pragmatic cooperation in various fields with the goal of large trade and investment markets, large circulation of money and finance, large-scale infrastructure connectivity, and exchanges between people and culture. At present, they have covered dozens of fields such as economy and trade, finance, science, education, culture and health. The new-type international relations of win-win cooperation make a vivid interpretation. , 　　 The third is to be a world-minded person. The BRICS countries have come step by step on the road of development, and we feel the same with those people who are in war and poverty. From the beginning, our five nations have adopted the principle of ""dialogue without confrontation, partnership without alliance"" as a guideline, advocating to follow the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the basic principles of international law and international relations in dealing with relations between countries. Other countries share development opportunities. Nowadays, the BRICS cooperation concept is more and more understood and recognized, and has become a positive energy in the international community. , 　　 These are the concrete manifestations of the BRICS spirit, and the common value pursuit of our five countries after 10 years of cooperation and cohesion. This spirit is constantly sublimating in practice, bringing well-being to the people of the five countries, and making the world different because of BRICS cooperation. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　Looking back in the past is to find out the way forward. Looking at the world, we see that the world economy has resumed growth, and emerging market countries and developing countries have performed well. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation are poised to take off, and the trend of reform and innovation is surging forward. We have every reason to believe that this world will be better. At the same time, we also see that more than 700 million people worldwide are still starving, tens of millions of refugees are displaced, and countless people, including innocent children, have been killed. The world economy has not yet stepped out of the adjustment period for sub-health and weak growth, and new kinetic energy is still gestating. Economic globalization has encountered more uncertainty, and the external environment for the development of emerging market countries and developing countries has become more complicated. The road to world peace and development is still very long, and it will not be smooth. , 　　 Now, when someone sees the ups and downs of growth in emerging market countries such as the BRICS countries and developing countries, they assert that ""the BRICS are dying and fading."" Needless to say, affected by the complex internal and external environment, the development of BRICS countries will inevitably encounter headwinds of varying degrees. However, the potential and trends of the BRICS countries for continuous development have not changed. We are full of confidence in this. , 　　 Thousand years of tide has not fallen, the wind rises before sailing. Facing the future, the BRICS countries are faced with the important task of developing the economy and strengthening cooperation. We need to sum up successful experiences, sketch a vision for cooperation, embark on a new journey, and jointly create the second ""Golden Decade"" of BRICS cooperation. , 　　 First, deepen BRICS cooperation to boost the economic growth of the five countries. In recent years, the BRICS countries have led the world economic growth with the advantages of commodity supply, human resource costs, and international market demand. With the continuous development of the economies of the five countries, issues such as resource allocation and industrial structure have become increasingly prominent. At the same time, the world economic structure has undergone profound adjustments, international market demand has shrunk, and financial risks have accumulated. The traditional economic advantages of the BRICS countries are changing, entering the critical stage of rolling stones uphill and climbing hills. , 　　How to cross this stage? The answer is not one-sided pursuit of growth rate, but to stand on one's own, look at the long-term, promote structural reforms, and explore new growth drivers and development paths. We must seize the opportunities of the new industrial revolution, promote growth and transformation with innovation, actively participate in the wave of innovation and development brought about by intelligent manufacturing, the Internet+, the digital economy, and the sharing economy, and strive to lead the trend and accelerate the conversion of old and new kinetic energy. It is necessary to break the barriers restricting economic development through reforms, remove unreasonable institutional barriers, stimulate market and social vitality, and achieve higher quality, more resilient and more sustainable growth. , 　　 Although the BRICS countries have different national conditions, they are at a similar stage of development and have the same development goals. We should jointly explore ways of economic innovation and growth, strengthen macro-policy coordination and development strategy docking, give play to the complementary advantages of industrial structure and resource endowments, cultivate value chains and large markets for shared benefits, and form a coordinated development pattern. We must use the practical experience of reform and innovation to break new paths for other emerging market countries and developing countries to seize opportunities and respond to challenges. , 　　 economic cooperation is the foundation of the BRICS mechanism. We should focus on this main line and implement the ""BRICS""Encounter and cope with challenges to break a new path. , 　　 economic cooperation is the foundation of the BRICS mechanism. We should focus on this main line, implement the ""BRICS Economic Partnership Strategy"", promote the institutionalization and solidification of cooperation in various fields, and continuously increase the gold content of BRICS cooperation. This year, we have achieved a series of results in the fields of new development banks and emergency reserve arrangements, e-commerce, trade and investment facilitation, service trade, local currency bonds, technological innovation, industrial cooperation, government and social capital cooperation, and expanded our economy. The breadth and depth of cooperation. We must continue to work hard to implement past achievements and consensus, let the existing mechanisms work, and actively explore new ways and new connotations of pragmatic cooperation, tighten links, and make the BRICS cooperation stable and far-reaching. , 　　 Second, bravely assume the BRICS responsibilities and safeguard the world and peace. Peace and development are the foundation and premise of each other. It is the common wish of the peoples of the world to want peace without conflict and cooperation without confrontation. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all countries, overall world peace has been maintained for more than half a century. However, the world is still not peaceful, and regional conflicts and hotspot issues are unprecedented and rising again. Terrorism, cyber security and other threats are intertwined, casting a shadow on the world. , 　　 The BRICS countries are defenders of world peace and builders of the international security order. This year, we held a meeting of high-level representatives of security affairs and a formal meeting of foreign ministers, established a regular consultation mechanism for representatives of multilateral agencies, and convened foreign policy consultations, counter-terrorism working groups, cybersecurity working groups, and peacekeeping consultations. Communicate and coordinate on major regional issues and bring together the BRICS. We must safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms of international relations, firmly safeguard multilateralism, promote the democratization of international relations, and oppose hegemonism and power politics. It is necessary to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, constructively participate in the geopolitical hotspot problem resolution process, and play its due role. , 　　 I believe that as long as we adhere to comprehensive measures, treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and resolutely combat all forms of terrorism, terrorists will have nowhere to hide. As long as dialogue, consultation and negotiation are adhered to and conditions are created for the political settlement of the Syria, Libya, Palestine and Israel issues, the war will eventually subside and the displaced refugees will be able to return to their homes. , 　　 Third, play the role of BRICS and improve global economic governance. Only openness can make progress, and only tolerance can make progress last. As the world economy is in a weak period in recent years, problems such as development imbalances, governance dilemmas, and fair deficits have become more prominent, and protectionism and internal trends have increased. The world economy and the global economic governance system have entered a period of adjustment and are facing new challenges. , 　　 We cannot ignore the problems that arise in the process of economic globalization, nor can we blame others, but we must work together to come up with solutions. We must work with the international community to strengthen dialogue, coordination and cooperation, and make positive contributions to maintaining and promoting the stability and growth of the world economy. To this end, we should promote the construction of an open world economy, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, work together to create a new global value chain, and realize the rebalancing of economic globalization so that it benefits the peoples of all countries. Our five countries should increase the level of opening up to each other, expand their common interests in opening up, seek opportunities to share in tolerance, and open up a wider space for the economic development of the five countries. , 　　 The development of emerging market countries and developing countries is not about whose cheese they want to move, but to strive to make the world economic cake bigger. We must work together to guide the direction of economic globalization, provide more advanced concepts and public products, promote the establishment of a more balanced and inclusive governance model and rules, and promote the optimization and reshaping of the international division of labor system and the global value chain. It is necessary to promote the reform of the global economic governance system, reflect the reality of the world economic structure, and improve the governance rules of the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, networks and other Xinjiang domains to ensure the sharing of rights and responsibilities of all countries. , 　　 Fourth, expand the BRICS influence and build a broad partnership. As a cooperation platform with global influence, the significance of BRICS cooperation has exceeded the scope of the five countries, carrying the expectations of emerging market countries, developing countries and the entire international community. The BRICS countries adhere to the concept of open and inclusive cooperation, attach great importance to cooperation with other emerging market countries and developing countries, and establish effective dialogue mechanisms. , 　　 One arrow is easy to break, ten arrows are hard to break. We should give full play to our own advantages and influence, promote South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue, gather the collective strength of all countries, and work together to meet risk challenges. We should expand the scope and benefits of BRICS cooperation, promote the ""BRICS+"" cooperation model, create an open and diversified network of development partners, and allow more emerging market countries and developing countries to participate in the cause of unity and cooperation for mutual benefit and win-win results. Come. , 　　 During the Xiamen meeting, China will hold a dialogue between emerging market countries and developing countries, inviting five leaders from countries in different regions of the world, 　　 During the Xiamen meeting, China will hold a dialogue meeting between emerging market countries and developing countries, inviting five leaders from countries in different regions of the world to discuss international development cooperation and South-South cooperation plans to promote the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. , 　　Whether it is to deepen BRICS' own cooperation or to build a broad partnership, mutual understanding, understanding, and friendship between the people are indispensable cornerstones. We should play the role of cultural exchange links, bring people from all walks of life into the BRICS cooperation cause, create more activities like cultural festivals, film festivals, sports meets that benefit the people's livelihood, and let the BRICS stories spread all over the streets. This will allow the exchanges and friendships of the people of the five countries to converge into a torrential river, injecting endless impetus into BRICS cooperation. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! 10 years of continuous deepening of the BRICS cooperation mechanism is also the 10 years of China's comprehensive promotion of reform and opening up and rapid economic and social development. In the past 10 years, China’s total economic growth has grown by 239%, and the total volume of imports and exports has increased by 73%. It has become the world’s second largest economy. The living standards of more than 1.3 billion Chinese people have achieved a major leap. It is also getting bigger.　　 It is undeniable that as China's reform enters a period of tough times and deep-water areas, some deep-seated contradictions and problems are highlighted, which requires great determination and great efforts to resolve them. There is a saying in China that good medicine is bitter. We have adopted a recipe for comprehensively deepening reform. Over the past five years, we have adopted more than 1,500 reform measures to promote the reform to show full force, multi-point breakthroughs, and in-depth advancement. The pace of economic restructuring and industrial upgrading has continued to accelerate, and the economic stability has continued to consolidate and the economy has continued to strengthen. New kinetic energy for development is constantly accumulating. In the first half of this year, China's economy grew by 6.9%, the added value of the tertiary industry accounted for 54.1% of GDP, and there were 7.35 million new urban jobs. Facts have proved that the way to comprehensively deepen reform is on the right track, and we must continue on a big step. , 　　 Facing the future, China will deeply implement the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing, constantly adapt, grasp and lead the new normal of economic development, promote the supply-side structural reform, accelerate the construction of a new open economic system, and lead by innovation Economic development to achieve sustainable development. China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and make new and greater contributions to world peace and development. , 　　 In May this year, China successfully hosted the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum. The heads of state and government of 29 countries, more than 1,600 representatives from more than 140 countries and more than 80 international organizations attended, marking the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” The initiative has entered a new stage from concept to action, from planning to implementation. At the meeting, representatives from various countries discussed plans for cooperation, sought common development strategies, and reached broad consensus. It should be pointed out that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative is not a geopolitical tool, but a pragmatic platform for cooperation; it is not a foreign aid plan, but a joint development initiative of consultation, construction, and sharing. I believe that the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative will build a new platform for countries to achieve win-win cooperation and create new opportunities for the implementation of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. , 　　 The business community is the main force in the economic development of the BRICS countries. Over the past 10 years, people in the business community have integrated enterprise development into BRICS cooperation and made important contributions to building a BRICS economic partnership. The purpose of arranging the Business Forum on the eve of the leaders' meeting is to listen to the opinions and suggestions of the business community, jointly manage the Xiamen meeting and build the BRICS cooperation. I hope you can make use of the advantages of industry and commerce in information, technology, capital, etc., carry out more mutually beneficial and win-win, pragmatic cooperation projects that benefit the country and the people, and make greater contributions to the promotion of economic and social development and the well-being of the people. The Chinese government will continue to encourage Chinese companies to take root in other countries, and warmly welcomes companies from other countries to invest in China. , 　　 ladies, gentlemen, friends! , 　　 The BRICS countries will usher in a more dynamic second decade, let us work together with the international community to make the fruits of our cooperation benefit the people of the five countries, and the welfare of world peace and development to the people of all countries. , 　　 Finally, I wish this business forum a complete success! ,   thank you all. , 　　 (Xinhua News Agency,

  发布时间：2017-09-04,"[, 尊敬的特梅尔总统、尊敬的祖马总统，, 各位工商界代表，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 　　下午好！很高兴同大家相聚在风景怡人的“鹭岛”厦门。明天，金砖国家领导人会晤就要拉开帷幕。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民、代表厦门市民，并以我个人的名义，向参加会议的各位嘉宾表示热烈的欢迎！, 　　厦门自古就是通商裕国的口岸，也是开放合作的门户，正所谓“厦庇五洲客，门纳万顷涛”。1985年我来到福建工作，厦门是第一站。当时的厦门身处中国改革开放前沿，是先行先试的经济特区，也是一片发展的热土。30多载春风化雨，今天的厦门已经发展成一座高素质的创新创业之城，新经济新产业快速发展，贸易投资并驾齐驱，海运、陆运、空运通达五洲。今天的厦门也是一座高颜值的生态花园之城，人与自然和谐共生。, 　　闽南民众常说，“爱拼才会赢”。这其中蕴含着一种锐意进取的精神。厦门这座城市的成功实践，折射着13亿多中国人民自强不息的奋斗史。改革开放近40年来，在中国共产党领导下，中国人民凭着一股逢山开路、遇水架桥的闯劲，凭着一股滴水穿石的韧劲，成功走出一条中国特色社会主义道路。我们遇到过困难，我们遇到过挑战，但我们不懈奋斗、与时俱进，用勤劳、勇敢、智慧书写着当代中国发展进步的故事。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　金砖合作正处在承前启后的关键节点上。观察金砖合作发展，有两个维度十分重要。一是要把金砖合作放在世界发展和国际格局演变的历史进程中来看。二是要把金砖合作放在五国各自和共同发展的历史进程中来看。, 　　现在，我们正处在一个大发展大变革大调整的时代。虽然全球范围内冲突和贫困尚未根除，但和平与发展的时代潮流愈发强劲。世界多极化、经济全球化、文化多样化、社会信息化深入发展，弱肉强食的丛林法则、你输我赢的零和游戏不再符合时代逻辑，和平、发展、合作、共赢成为各国人民共同呼声。, 　　在这样的大背景下，一大批新兴市场国家和发展中国家异军突起，在国际事务中发挥着日益重要的作用。金砖合作也应运而生，我们五国怀着追求和平与发展的共同愿望走到一起。在过去10年中，金砖国家携手同行，成长为世界经济的新亮点。, 　　——10年中，金砖国家探索进取，谋求共同发展。2008年爆发的国际金融危机突如其来，直接导致世界经济急刹车，至今未能重回正轨。面对外部环境突然变化，我们五国立足国内，集中精力发展经济、改善民生。10年间，五国经济总量增长179%，贸易总额增长94%，城镇化人口增长28%，为世界经济企稳复苏作出突出贡献，也让30多亿人民有了实实在在的获得感。, 　　——10年中，金砖国家务实为先，推进互利合作。我们五国发挥互补优势，拉紧利益纽带，建立起领导人引领的全方位、多层次合作架构，涌现出一批契合五国发展战略、符合五国人民利益的合作项目。特别是新开发银行和应急储备安排的建立，为金砖国家基础设施建设和可持续发展提供了融资支持，为完善全球经济治理、构建国际金融安全网作出了有益探索。, 　　——10年中，金砖国家敢于担当，力求在国际舞台上有所作为。我们五国秉持多边主义，倡导公平正义，就国际和地区重大问题发出声音、提出方案。我们五国积极推动全球经济治理改革，提升新兴市场国家和发展中国家代表性和发言权。我们五国高举发展旗帜，带头落实千年发展目标和可持续发展目标，加强同广大发展中国家对话合作，谋求联合自强。, 　　万丈高楼平地起。如今，金砖合作基础已经打下，整体架构轮廓初现。回望来时路，我认为有3条启示十分重要，应该在今后的合作中发扬光大。, 　　一是平等相待、求同存异。金砖国家不搞一言堂，凡事大家商量着来。我们五国尊重彼此发展道路和模式，相互照顾关切，致力于增进战略沟通和政治互信。我们五国在国情、历史、文化等方面存在差异，合作中难免遇到一些分歧，但只要坚定合作信念、坚持增信释疑，就能在合作道路上越走越稳。, 　　二是务实创新、合作共赢。金砖国家不是碌碌无为的清谈馆，而是知行合一的行动队。我们五国以贸易投资大市场、货币金融大流通、基础设施大联通、人文大交流为目标，推进各领域务实合作，目前已经涵盖经贸、财金、科教、文卫等数十个领域，对合作共赢的新型国际关系作出生动诠释。, 　　三是胸怀天下、立己达人。金砖国家都是在发展道路上一步一步走过来的，对那些身处战乱和贫困的百姓，我们感同身受。我们五国从发起之初便以“对话而不对抗，结伴而不结盟”为准则，倡导遵循联合国宪章宗旨和原则以及国际法和国际关系基本准则处理国家间关系，愿在实现自身发展的同时同其他国家共享发展机遇。如今，金砖合作理念得到越来越多理解和认同，成为国际社会的一股正能量。, 　　这些都是金砖精神的具体体现，是我们五国历经10年合作凝聚的共同价值追求。这种精神在实践中不断升华，为五国人民带来福祉，也让世界因金砖合作而有所不同。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　回首过去，是为了找准前进方向。放眼世界，我们看到世界经济重新恢复增长，新兴市场国家和发展中国家表现突出。新一轮科技革命和产业变革蓄势待发，改革创新潮流奔腾向前。我们有足够的理由相信，这个世界会更好。, 　　同时，我们也看到，全球7亿多人口还在忍饥挨饿，数以千万的难民颠沛流离，无数民众包括无辜的孩子丧身炮火。世界经济尚未走出亚健康和弱增长的调整期，新动能仍在孕育。经济全球化遭遇更多不确定性，新兴市场国家和发展中国家发展的外部环境更趋复杂。世界和平与发展之路还很长，前行不会一路坦途。, 　　现在，有人看到金砖国家等新兴市场国家和发展中国家的增长出现起伏，就断言“金砖失色、褪色”。毋庸讳言，受内外复杂环境影响，金砖国家发展难免遭遇不同程度的逆风。但是，金砖国家不断向前发展的潜力和趋势没有改变。我们对此充满信心。, 　　千年潮未落，风起再扬帆。面向未来，金砖国家面临着发展经济、加强合作的重要任务。我们要总结成功经验，勾画合作愿景，踏上新的征程，共同开创金砖合作第二个“金色十年”。, 　　第一，深化金砖合作，助推五国经济增加动力。近年来，金砖国家凭借大宗商品供给、人力资源成本、国际市场需求等优势，引领世界经济增长。随着五国经济不断发展，资源要素配置、产业结构等问题日渐突出。同时，世界经济结构经历深刻调整，国际市场需求萎缩，金融风险积聚。金砖国家经济传统优势在发生变化，进入到滚石上山、爬坡过坎的关键阶段。, 　　如何跨越这一阶段？答案是不能片面追求增长速度，而是要立足自身、放眼长远，推进结构性改革，探寻新的增长动力和发展路径。要把握新工业革命的机遇，以创新促增长、促转型，积极投身智能制造、互联网+、数字经济、共享经济等带来的创新发展浪潮，努力领风气之先，加快新旧动能转换。要通过改革打破制约经济发展的藩篱，扫清不合理的体制机制障碍，激发市场和社会活力，实现更高质量、更具韧性、更可持续的增长。, 　　金砖国家虽然国情不同，但处于相近发展阶段，具有相同发展目标。我们应该共同探索经济创新增长之道，加强宏观政策协调和发展战略对接，发挥产业结构和资源禀赋互补优势，培育利益共享的价值链和大市场，形成联动发展格局。我们要用改革创新的实践经验，为其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家抢抓机遇、应对挑战闯出一条新路。, 　　经济合作是金砖机制的根基。我们应该紧紧围绕这条主线，落实《金砖国家经济伙伴战略》，推动各领域合作机制化、实心化，不断提升金砖合作含金量。今年，我们在新开发银行和应急储备安排建设、电子商务、贸易和投资便利化、服务贸易、本币债券、科技创新、工业合作、政府和社会资本合作等领域取得了一系列成果，拓展了经济合作广度和深度。我们要继续努力，落实以往的成果和共识，让现有机制发挥作用，同时积极探索务实合作新方式新内涵，拉紧联系纽带，让金砖合作行稳致远。, 　　第二，勇担金砖责任，维护世界和平安宁。和平与发展互为基础和前提。要和平不要冲突、要合作不要对抗是世界各国人民共同愿望。在各国一道努力下，世界总体和平得以保持半个多世纪。但是，世界仍不太平，地区冲突和热点问题一波未平、一波又起。恐怖主义、网络安全等威胁相互交织，为世界蒙上一层阴影。, 　　金砖国家是世界和平的维护者、国际安全秩序的建设者。今年，我们举行安全事务高级代表会议和外长正式会晤，建立常驻多边机构代表定期磋商机制，召开外交政策磋商、反恐工作组、网络安全工作组、维和事务磋商等会议，就是要加强在国际和地区重大问题上的沟通和协调，汇聚金砖合力。我们要维护联合国宪章宗旨和原则以及国际关系基本准则，坚定维护多边主义，推动国际关系民主化，反对霸权主义和强权政治。要倡导共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，建设性参与地缘政治热点问题解决进程，发挥应有作用。, 　　我相信，只要坚持综合施策、标本兼治，坚决打击一切形式的恐怖主义，恐怖分子终将无处容身。只要坚持对话协商谈判，为叙利亚、利比亚、巴以等问题的政治解决创造条件，战火终将平息，流离失所的难民定能重返家园。, 　　第三，发挥金砖作用，完善全球经济治理。唯有开放才能进步，唯有包容才能让进步持久。由于近年来世界经济处于疲弱期，发展失衡、治理困境、公平赤字等问题显得更加突出，保护主义和内顾倾向有所上升。世界经济和全球经济治理体系进入调整期，面临新的挑战。, 　　对经济全球化进程中出现的问题，我们不能视而不见，也不能怨天尤人，而是要齐心协力拿出解决方案。我们要同国际社会一道，加强对话、协调、合作，为维护和促进世界经济稳定和增长作出积极贡献。为此，我们应该推动建设开放型世界经济，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化，合力打造新的全球价值链，实现经济全球化再平衡，使之惠及各国人民。我们五国要相互提高开放水平，在开放中做大共同利益，在包容中谋求机遇共享，为五国经济发展开辟更加广阔的空间。, 　　新兴市场国家和发展中国家的发展，不是要动谁的奶酪，而是要努力把世界经济的蛋糕做大。我们要合力引导好经济全球化走向，提供更多先进理念和公共产品，推动建立更加均衡普惠的治理模式和规则，促进国际分工体系和全球价值链优化重塑。要推动全球经济治理体系变革，反映世界经济格局现实，并且完善深海、极地、外空、网络等新疆域的治理规则，确保各国权利共享、责任共担。, 　　第四，拓展金砖影响，构建广泛伙伴关系。作为具有全球影响力的合作平台，金砖合作的意义已超出五国范畴，承载着新兴市场国家和发展中国家乃至整个国际社会的期望。金砖国家奉行开放包容的合作理念，高度重视同其他新兴市场国家和发展中国家合作，建立起行之有效的对话机制。, 　　一箭易断，十箭难折。我们应该发挥自身优势和影响力，促进南南合作和南北对话，汇聚各国集体力量，联手应对风险挑战。我们应该扩大金砖合作的辐射和受益范围，推动“金砖+”合作模式，打造开放多元的发展伙伴网络，让更多新兴市场国家和发展中国家参与到团结合作、互利共赢的事业中来。, 　　厦门会晤期间，中方将举行新兴市场国家与发展中国家对话会，邀请来自全球不同地区国家的5位领导人共商国际发展合作和南南合作大计，推动落实2030年可持续发展议程。, 　　无论是深化金砖自身合作，还是构建广泛的伙伴关系，人民相互了解、理解、友谊都是不可或缺的基石。我们应该发挥人文交流纽带作用，把各界人士汇聚到金砖合作事业中来，打造更多像文化节、电影节、运动会这样接地气、惠民生的活动，让金砖故事传遍大街小巷，让我们五国人民的交往和情谊汇成滔滔江河，为金砖合作注入绵绵不绝的动力。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　金砖合作机制不断走深走实的10年，也是中国全面推进改革开放、经济社会实现快速发展的10年。10年中，中国经济总量增长239%，货物进出口总额增长73%，成为世界第二大经济体，13亿多中国人民的生活水平实现大幅飞跃，中国为世界和地区经济发展作出的贡献也越来越大。, 　　不可否认的是，随着中国改革进入攻坚期和深水区，一些深层次的矛盾和问题凸显出来，需要下大决心、花大气力加以破解。中国有句话叫良药苦口。我们采用的是全面深化改革这剂良方。这5年来，我们采取了1500多项改革举措，推动改革呈现全面发力、多点突破、纵深推进的局面，经济结构调整和产业升级步伐不断加快，经济稳中向好态势不断巩固，经济持续发展的新动能不断积聚。今年上半年，中国经济增长6.9%，第三产业增加值占国内生产总值的54.1%，新增城镇就业735万人。事实证明，全面深化改革的路走对了，还要大步走下去。, 　　面向未来，中国将深入贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念，不断适应、把握、引领经济发展新常态，推进供给侧结构性改革，加快构建开放型经济新体制，以创新引领经济发展，实现可持续发展。中国将坚定不移走和平发展道路，为世界和平与发展作出新的更大贡献。, 　　今年5月，中方成功主办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，29个国家的元首和政府首脑，140多个国家、80多个国际组织的1600多名代表出席，标志着共建“一带一路”倡议已经进入从理念到行动、从规划到实施的新阶段。各国代表在会上共商合作大计，共谋发展良策，达成广泛共识。需要指出的是，共建“一带一路”倡议不是地缘政治工具，而是务实合作平台；不是对外援助计划，而是共商共建共享的联动发展倡议。我相信，共建“一带一路”倡议将为各国实现合作共赢搭建起新的平台，为落实2030年可持续发展议程创造新的机遇。, 　　工商界是金砖国家经济发展的主力军。10年来，工商界人士将企业发展融入金砖合作，为构建金砖经济伙伴关系作出重要贡献。把工商论坛安排在领导人会晤前夕举行，就是为了听取工商界的意见和建议，共同把厦门会晤办好，把金砖合作建设好。希望你们发挥工商界在信息、技术、资金等方面的优势，开展更多互利共赢、利国利民的务实合作项目，为促进经济社会发展、增进人民福祉作出更大贡献。中国政府将继续鼓励中国企业到其他国家落地扎根，也热忱欢迎其他国家的企业来中国投资兴业。, 　　女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 　　金砖国家将迎来更富活力的第二个十年，让我们同国际社会一道努力，让我们的合作成果惠及五国人民，让世界和平与发展的福祉惠及各国民众。, 　　最后，我预祝这次工商论坛取得圆满成功！, 　　谢谢大家。, 　　（新华社厦门9月3日电） , 　　《 人民日报 》（ 2017年09月04日 02 版）,

22,159,"[, July 3, on a state visit to the Russian Federation, President Xi Jinping was interviewed by mainstream Russian media. The full text is as follows: 1. Q: You have repeatedly stated that Sino-Russian relations are at the best period in history. What aspects do you think this reflects? What is the significance of the timely dialogue and consultation between Russia and China on major international issues for global and regional peace, stability, development and prosperity? A: At present, China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation is at the best period in history. I think it is mainly reflected in the following aspects. First, a high level of political and strategic mutual trust has been established. The two sides have completely resolved the border issue left over by history, and the common border of more than 4,300 kilometers has become a link connecting the friendship between the two peoples. The two sides signed the ""China-Russia Good-Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Treaty"", which established the concept of friendship between generations in legal form. The two sides reached a consensus of ""four mutual support"", that is, they firmly support each other's efforts to safeguard their core interests such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. Manage your own affairs. China and Russia are each other's most reliable strategic partners. Second, the mechanism for high-level exchanges and cooperation in various fields is perfect. I have established a close working relationship and good personal friendship with President Putin, maintaining the frequency of 5 meetings per year, and jointly leading and planning the development of relations between the two countries. At the invitation of President Putin, I am about to pay a state visit to Russia. I believe this visit will inject new impetus into the development of Sino-Russian relations. The exchange and consultation mechanisms at all levels, departments and localities of the two countries are complete. The development of Sino-Russian relations is guaranteed by a solid mechanism. 3. The third is to actively connect with their respective development strategies. President Putin and I have reached an important consensus on the integration of the “Belt and Road” construction with the Eurasian Economic Union. The cooperation between the two countries in the fields of energy, trade, investment, high technology, finance, infrastructure construction, agriculture and other fields has developed rapidly, with modernization and technological innovation content. constantly improving. The Tianwan Nuclear Power Station has become a model project for Sino-Russian nuclear energy cooperation, and the Sino-Russian Eastern Natural Gas Pipeline Project is progressing smoothly. Both sides are actively carrying out joint development of strategic large-scale projects such as long-range wide-body passenger aircraft and heavy helicopters, and are committed to enhancing the comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness of the two countries. The two sides also agreed to develop cooperation in emerging fields such as innovation and e-commerce, and tap new growth points and potential for cooperation. The vigorous development of pragmatic cooperation has become the engine of continuous development of Sino-Russian relations. Fourth, the foundation of society and public opinion is solid and firm. This year is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Russia Friendship, Peace and Development Committee and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Russia-China Friendship Association. There are more than 3 million person-to-person exchanges between the two countries each year, and China has maintained Russia's status as the largest source of foreign tourists for many years. The two sides set up cultural centers and set up a joint university, and set a goal of reaching 100,000 international students by 2020. The people of the two countries love the language and culture of each other's country, and their mutual understanding and friendship are increasing day by day. The development of Sino-Russian friendly and cooperative relations has become the common aspiration and aspiration of the two peoples. Fifth, maintain close strategic coordination in international and regional affairs. Both China and Russia are major world powers, permanent members of the UN Security Council, and emerging market countries. They all uphold the basic principles of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, advocate world multipolarization and democratization of international relations, and firmly defend the second The victory of World War II and international fairness and justice. The two sides have closely coordinated and cooperated within the international multilateral frameworks of the United Nations, the G20, APEC and other international frameworks, and jointly advocated the establishment of multilateral mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS cooperation and strived to promote their development, safeguarding the commonness of Central Asia and Northeast Asia. The surrounding area is peaceful and stable. The cooperation between the two countries in international affairs has effectively maintained regional and world peace, security and stability, played a role of stabilizer in the volatile international situation, and embodies the responsibility of China and Russia for world peace and development. Looking ahead, we have full confidence in the development of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation. I would like to continue to work with President Putin to lead and promote the healthy development of relations between the two countries along the established track, better promote the respective development and revitalization of the two countries, and better promote world prosperity and stability. 2. Q: Some people think that the current level of development of Russia-China political relations is much higher than that of economic and trade relations. What measures do you think should be taken to improve bilateral economic and trade relations between Russia and China? Which directions and major projects have priority? A: President Putin and I attach great importance to and actively promote Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation. Economic and trade cooperation is the most extensive in China-Russia pragmatic cooperation and has huge cooperation potential. Therefore, we must take a comprehensive view of the development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. China maintains Russia for 7 consecutive yearsIn China-Russia pragmatic cooperation, the foundation field is the broadest and the cooperation potential is huge. Therefore, we must take a comprehensive view of the development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. China has maintained Russia's largest trading partner status for seven consecutive years. Last year, Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation overcome the adverse effects of the world economic downturn, crude oil and other commodity price fluctuations and other factors, and achieved a stop-and-fall recovery. The bilateral trade volume reached 69.53 billion US dollars, an increase of 2.2% year-on-year. In the first five months of this year, bilateral trade has further accelerated, with an increase of 26%. The annual trade volume is expected to exceed 80 billion US dollars. , In particular, the structure of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has been continuously optimized, showing many new growth points. First, electromechanical and high-tech products maintained rapid growth. The growth rates in the first quarter of this year were 20.8% and 19.4%, respectively. Second, the effect of investment cooperation is gradually appearing. The investment cooperation committees of the two governments have determined a new batch of 73 cooperation projects this year, and some projects are being implemented as planned. The third is to promote financial cooperation in depth. The Russian Central Bank established the first overseas representative office in China. Russian companies became the first companies along the “Belt and Road” to successfully issue panda bonds in China. China announced the establishment of a Sino-Russian regional cooperation and development investment fund with a total scale of 100 billion yuan to promote cooperation between Northeast China and the Russian Far East. The fourth is the rapid development of agricultural trade. China welcomes more Russian high-quality agricultural products to enter the Chinese market. Fifth, the development cooperation of the Far East has been accelerated. China has become the largest trading partner in the Russian Far East, and the two parties have actively promoted a number of potential cooperation projects in areas such as deep processing of resources, port logistics, modern agriculture, and infrastructure construction. Sixth, strategic major projects in China, Russia, energy, nuclear energy, aviation, aerospace, cross-border infrastructure construction and other fields are steadily advancing. For example, the construction of the East Line natural gas pipeline is progressing smoothly, and Chinese companies are actively participating in the construction of the Yamal LPG project. The passenger aircraft joint venture company was established in Shanghai in May this year. Of course, the scale of mutual investment between China and Russia needs to be expanded, and the development of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises needs to be accelerated. Both parties need to work together. Both sides should strengthen traditional economic and trade cooperation, including Chinese imports of commodities such as oil and gas, coal, electricity, sawn timber from Russia, expand bilateral local currency settlement, implement agreed investment projects, and make full use of the China-Russia Expo, St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, and the Oriental Economic Forum And other exhibition platforms, and tap the potential for economic and trade cooperation between China and Russia, such as the ""Yangtze River-Volga River"", ""Northeast China-Far East"" and other border areas The development of China and Russia is inseparable from the development of Eurasia, and will also promote the development of Eurasia with its own development. In May this year, President Putin expressed his support and willingness to actively participate in the construction of the “Belt and Road” during his participation in the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. China and Russia are actively promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road” and cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union. Within the framework of docking cooperation, the two sides are actively discussing the economic and trade cooperation agreement between China and the Eurasian Economic Union and the list of docking cooperation projects. This will open up a broader space for development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, help to enhance the level of trade and investment facilitation between the two countries, create more new cooperation opportunities for entrepreneurs of the two countries, and achieve effective industries, technologies, capital, and markets. Circulation enables the countries of Eurasia to share benefits in the process of economic globalization and regional integration. At the level of bilateral large-scale project cooperation, the two sides must insist on the integration of upstream and downstream integration in the energy field. Strategic major projects are the cornerstone of the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. Its comprehensive benefits and strategic effects cannot be reflected and measured by simple figures. The two sides should carry out more joint research and development, joint production, promotion and application and other cooperation. At the level of connectivity, we welcome and are willing to actively participate in the Russian proposal for the joint development and construction of the Binhai International Transportation Corridor. We hope that the two sides will soon complete major cross-border infrastructure such as the Tongjiang Railway Bridge and the Heihe Highway Bridge, and jointly develop and utilize the marine channel. Especially the Arctic waterway, to create the ""Silk Road on Ice"". Cooperation in these interconnected areas will provide new momentum for the further development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. , Small and medium-sized enterprises are an important support for national economic growth, as well as a positive element to promote social innovation and create a large number of jobs. The governments of the two countries should create favorable conditions for the cooperation of small and medium-sized enterprises, mobilize their enthusiasm for cooperation, enable large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises to develop synchronously, promote each other, and jointly develop markets in third countries. In short, President Putin and I believe that China and Russia should deepen economic and trade cooperation and build a bond of common interests. At the same time, we must focus on the long-term, promote the spirit of mutual expansion of opening up and mutually beneficial cooperation, and focus on enhancing the comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness of the two countries. So that the results of the cooperation will benefit the people of both countries. 3. Q: You successfully hosted the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in May this year. What's your comment on the results of this summit forum? What do you expect of the future development prospects of the “Belt and Road” construction? How do you rate Russia in the ""Belt and Road""What is your comment on the results of this summit forum? What do you expect of the future development prospects of the “Belt and Road” construction? How do you evaluate Russia's role in the construction of the ""Belt and Road""? A: The “Belt and Road” initiative was proposed by me during my visit to Central and Southeast Asia in 2013. The purpose is to strengthen international cooperation, connect with each other’s development strategies, achieve complementary advantages, and promote common development. In the past four years, the cooperation on the “Belt and Road” has been steadily advancing. It has been generally welcomed and actively participated by all parties, and has achieved a number of important early gains. Against this background, we successfully held the “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in Beijing in May this year, mainly to summarize the past and plan for the future. Leaders from 29 countries and heads of the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, and more than 1,600 representatives from more than 140 countries and more than 80 international organizations participated. Regarding the theme of ""strengthening international cooperation, jointly building the ""Belt and Road"" and achieving win-win development"", all parties exchanged in-depth views on such topics as strengthening policy coordination and development strategy docking, deepening partnerships, promoting interconnection, and promoting cultural exchanges. The meeting summarized the progress of the “Belt and Road” cooperation and reached a broad consensus. All parties formed 5 major categories, 76 major projects, and more than 270 specific results. They passed on the parties to build a cooperation platform, seek momentum for world economic growth, and promote economic globalization Develop positive signals that boost confidence. , We will take this as an opportunity to use the principles of mutual consultation, joint construction, and sharing to promote policy communication, facility connectivity, trade smoothness, capital and financial connectivity, and popular support among countries. Strengthen policy coordination and development strategy docking, take interconnection as a key area of ​​cooperation, support the acceleration of economic corridor construction, promote international production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, promote cooperation in education, science and technology, culture, health care and other fields, and jointly explore new drivers of economic growth, Achieve the common development of all countries and strive to build a community with a shared future for mankind Russian President Vladimir Putin was the first leader to accept my invitation to participate in the Summit Forum, which exemplifies Russia's important support for China's meeting and the high level of Sino-Russian relations. In May 2015, China and Russia reached an important consensus on docking cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union on the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative, which was actively supported by other Eurasian Economic Union members. Over the past two years, docking cooperation has been steadily carried out, with significant progress. China is willing to work with Russia to take the opportunity of advancing the construction of the “Belt and Road” and the Eurasian Economic Union and continue to promote the continuous development of Sino-Russian relations. 4. Q: Can you please briefly introduce the current economic development in China? What do you expect from the upcoming G20 Hamburg Summit? A: Since this year, China's economy has continued its stable development trend since the second half of last year. In the first quarter, China's GDP grew by 6.9%, achieving a good start. As the deep reforms in China's important areas and key links continue to advance and take effect, China's economy will continue to maintain steady and rapid growth as new kinetic energy cultivation and traditional kinetic energy transformation work together. At present, the momentum of world economic growth is further consolidated. The economic situation in developed and emerging market countries is generally improving, but it is also facing some serious challenges. Against this background, the G20 continues to play the role of the main forum for international economic cooperation, implement the consensus of the Hangzhou Summit and previous summits, and lead the direction of the world economy, which is particularly important and in the interest of all parties. China has the following expectations for the Hamburg Summit. First, I hope that the Group of Twenty will continue to uphold the spirit of partnership for win-win cooperation and win-win cooperation. This spirit has guided the G20 through the ups and downs of the international financial crisis and will continue to inspire the G20 to lead the wave of the world economy. As I said in the speech at the welcome dinner of the Hangzhou Summit, ""As long as we are tolerant and help each other, we can move forward steadily and reach the other side no matter the weather is good or the rain is strange."" Secondly, I hope that the G20 will continue to hold high the banner of the era of building an open world economy. As a leading force in the world economy, the G20 should insist on open development, support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization as its core, and promote trade and investment to continue to play the role of the world’s economic growth engine. Third, it is hoped that the G20 will continue to lead the development path of innovative growth and long-term governance. Countries need to continue to tap the new driving force of world economic growth through innovation, promote the in-depth development of the digital economy and the new industrial revolution, strengthen investment in infrastructure construction, comprehensively use fiscal policy, monetary policy, and structural reforms to promote a strong, sustainable, and balanced world economy And inclusive growth. The ""Belt and Road"" International Cooperation Summit Forum successfully held in Beijing in May is highly compatible with the theme of this year's Hamburg Summit-""Shaping a Linked World"". The Belt and Road Initiative and the G20 cooperation can complement and promote each other and jointly promote world economic growth. China is willing to use the Hamburg Summit as an opportunity to work together with all partiesCooperation with the G20 can complement and promote each other and jointly promote world economic growth. China is willing to use the Hamburg Summit as an opportunity to work with all parties to make positive contributions to promoting world economic growth and improving global economic governance. 5. Q: The tension on the Korean peninsula has not been effectively eased for a long time. The international community pays close attention to the peninsula issue. How does China think this problem should be solved? How does China view the US deployment of the ""Sade"" anti-missile system in South Korea? A: China pays close attention to the development of the situation on the peninsula, insists on denuclearization of the peninsula, maintains peace and stability on the peninsula, and resolves issues through dialogue and consultation. The peninsula issue has a long history and is intricate and complicated. To solve it, we must adhere to both the symptoms and the root cause, taking into account the reasonable concerns of all parties. To this end, China has proposed the idea of ​​“dual-track parallelism” to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, as well as the suspension of nuclear missile activities by North Korea and the suspension of large-scale joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea. The Russian side clearly understands and supports it. Both China and Russia have the same and similar positions, and the international community has increasingly responded positively. It is hoped that the relevant parties on the Korean Peninsula issue will respond to the efforts of both China and Russia to promote peace and talks, take up their respective responsibilities, explain each other's goodwill, and move towards each other, so as to strive to bring the Korean Peninsula issue to the right track of dialogue, consultation and settlement as soon as possible. The deployment of the ""Sade"" anti-missile system by the United States in South Korea has severely damaged national strategic security interests, including China and Russia, and undermined regional strategic balance. It will not help achieve the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and regional peace and stability. China has expressed its firm opposition and solemn concern about this. China and Russia maintain close communication and coordination on the ""Sade"" issue at all levels. Both sides have a high degree of consensus on the nature and harm of this issue. China and Russia firmly oppose the deployment of the ""Sade"" anti-missile system by the United States in South Korea and strongly urge the countries concerned to stop and cancel the relevant deployment. The two sides will jointly or individually take necessary measures to maintain the security interests of the two countries and the regional strategic balance. 6. Q: The international community pays close attention to the Syrian issue. How does China think this issue should be resolved? How do you evaluate Russia's role on the Syrian issue? A: The Syrian issue is currently the most complex and difficult-to-understand hot issue in the Middle East. It has caused deep suffering to the Syrian people and severe challenges to regional and world peace and stability. On the Syrian issue, China’s position is consistent. It advocates that Syria’s sovereign independence and territorial integrity should be maintained and respected. The Syrian country should be decided by the Syrian people in the future, and political settlement is the only realistic way out of the Syrian issue. We sincerely hope that the Syrian issue will be properly resolved as soon as possible, and hope that the Syrian people’s aspirations for peace can be realized as soon as possible, and they can return to and rebuild their homes. Recently, the Syrian issue has shown positive momentum. The parties concerned signed a memorandum at the Astana Dialogue and agreed to establish a conflict demotion zone in Syria. The Geneva peace talks hosted by the United Nations continued to advance. China advocates that under the current situation, the international community should maintain the hard-won political resolution of the Syrian issue, support the United Nations to continue to play its role as a main channel of good offices, promote the Syrian government and the opposition to show sincerity and patient consultation, and strive to reach a consensus that takes into account the legitimate concerns of all parties. Political solution. Relevant parties should also strengthen coordination and form a joint force to effectively combat terrorism in Syria within the framework of international law. The Russian side has played an important, positive influence and role in promoting the proper resolution of the Syrian issue. China appreciates this. 7. Question: Terrorism is a real threat to world security and development. How do you evaluate the cooperation between Russia and China in combating the ""three forces""? A: Recently, the global anti-terrorism situation has evolved profoundly, and international terrorist activities have continued to be active. Since this year, many countries have suffered severe terrorist attacks in succession, causing a large number of casualties. Various aspects indicate that despite the progress made by the international community in combating terrorism, global terrorist activities will continue to occur frequently, which will continue to impact world peace, stability, and development. Dealing with terrorist threats is still a prominent problem in global security governance. In the face of severe terrorist threats, the consciousness of the community of destiny in the international community is increasing, the consensus on counter-terrorism is increasing, and cooperation in combating terrorism has achieved important results. However, the problem is still outstanding: First, the superimposed resonance of terrorism and hot issues has become an important reason for the ""more anti-terrorism"" in the international community. Second, international terrorist organizations have called for and planned more terrorist attacks around the world. Third, violent and terrorist thoughts continue to spread through the Internet and social media, and its deep-level influence will continue to emerge. Fourth, some countries still use counter-terrorism as a means to advance their national interests and pursue double standards in counter-terrorism, which has led to instrumentalization and fragmentation of international cooperation in counter-terrorism, making it difficult to achieve joint efforts. , China has always supported the international community's efforts to combat terrorism in a constructive manner. We believe that to carry out international cooperation against terrorism, the first is to abandon the ""double, China has always supported the international community's efforts to combat terrorism in a constructive manner. We believe that to carry out international counter-terrorism cooperation, one must abandon the ""double standards"", give full play to the leading role of the United Nations in the international anti-terrorism struggle, and be determined to form a joint force; second, to properly resolve regional hotspot issues and help Syria and other Middle Eastern countries as soon as possible Restore stability and curb the rampant trend of terrorism; Third, we must focus on the long-term, comprehensive measures, cure both the symptoms and root causes, and take multiple measures in politics, economy, and culture to eliminate the breeding ground for terrorism from the source. Both China and Russia are victims of terrorism. The cooperation between the two countries in the field of anti-terrorism security is an important part of the Sino-Russian comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation and sets an example for international anti-terrorism cooperation. This is not only in the fundamental interests of the two countries, but also conducive to peace and stability in the region and the world. The two sides have conducted good cooperation in the areas of combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism through the law enforcement and security cooperation mechanism, and played an important and positive role in maintaining the stable development of the two countries and the region. China is willing to deepen bilateral pragmatic cooperation with Russia, increase mutual support in each other’s core concerns about counter-terrorism, and at the same time closely coordinate and cooperate within the multilateral frameworks of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, etc., uphold the leading role of the United Nations in international cooperation against terrorism and promote Anti-terrorism and security cooperation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other mechanisms have continued to deepen, and jointly promoted greater progress in counter-terrorism international cooperation. (Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3), ""People's Daily"" (July 04, 2017, 01 edition),]",Xi Jinping interviewed by Russian media,6452,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-07-04,"[, 7月3日，在对俄罗斯联邦进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平接受俄罗斯主流媒体采访。全文如下：, 一、问：您多次提出中俄关系处于历史最好时期，您认为这体现在哪些方面？俄中两国及时就主要国际问题进行对话协商的做法对全球和地区和平稳定和发展繁荣有何重要意义？, 答：当前，中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系处于历史最好时期，我认为主要体现在以下方面。, 一是建立了高水平的政治和战略互信。双方彻底解决了历史遗留的边界问题，4300多公里共同边界成为连接两国人民友谊的纽带。双方签署《中俄睦邻友好合作条约》，将世代友好的理念以法律形式确立下来。双方达成“四个相互坚定支持”共识，即坚定支持对方维护本国主权、安全、领土完整等核心利益的努力，坚定支持对方走符合本国国情的发展道路，坚定支持对方发展振兴，坚定支持对方把自己的事情办好。中俄互为最可信赖的战略伙伴。, 二是高层交往和各领域合作机制健全。我同普京总统建立了密切的工作关系和良好的个人友谊，保持年均5次会晤的频率，共同引领和规划两国关系发展。应普京总统邀请，我即将对俄罗斯进行国事访问，相信这次访问将为中俄关系发展注入新动力。两国各层级、各部门、各地方交往和磋商机制完备。中俄关系发展具有牢固的机制保障。, 三是积极对接各自发展战略。我和普京总统达成“一带一路”建设同欧亚经济联盟对接的重要共识，两国能源、贸易、投资、高技术、金融、基础设施建设、农业等各领域合作发展迅速，现代化和科技创新含量不断提升。田湾核电站成为中俄核能合作的典范项目，中俄东线天然气管道项目进展顺利。双方正在积极开展联合研制远程宽体客机和重型直升机等战略性大项目合作，致力于提升两国综合国力和国际竞争力。双方还商定发展创新、电子商务等新兴领域合作，挖掘新的合作增长点和潜力。蓬勃发展的务实合作成为中俄关系持续发展的引擎。, 四是社会和民意基础坚实牢固。今年是中俄友好、和平与发展委员会成立20周年和俄中友协成立60周年，也是中俄媒体交流年收官之年，双方正在举办一系列丰富多彩的人文交流活动。两国人员往来每年超过300万人次，中国连续多年保持俄罗斯最大外国游客客源国地位。双方互设文化中心，成立联合大学，制定了2020年互派留学生规模达到10万人的目标。两国民众十分喜爱对方国家的语言和文化，相互了解和友谊与日俱增。发展中俄友好合作关系成为两国人民的共同心声和愿望。, 五是在国际和地区事务中保持密切战略协作。中俄同为世界主要大国、联合国安理会常任理事国、新兴市场国家，都主张坚持以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为基石的国际关系基本准则，倡导世界多极化和国际关系民主化，坚决捍卫第二次世界大战胜利成果和国际公平正义。双方在联合国、二十国集团、亚太经合组织等国际多边框架内密切协调和配合，共同倡导建立了上海合作组织、金砖国家合作等多边机制并努力推动其发展，维护中亚、东北亚等共同周边和平稳定。两国在国际事务中的协作有力维护了地区及世界和平、安全、稳定，在动荡多变的国际局势中发挥了稳定器作用，体现了中俄两个大国对世界和平与发展的担当。, 展望未来，我们对中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系发展充满信心。我愿继续同普京总统一道，引领和推动两国关系沿着既定轨道健康发展，更好促进两国各自发展振兴，更好促进世界繁荣稳定。, 二、问：有人认为当前俄中政治关系发展水平远高于经贸关系，您认为应该采取何种措施来改善俄中双边经贸关系，哪些方向和大项目具有优先地位？, 答：我和普京总统都高度重视并积极推动中俄经贸合作。经贸合作在中俄务实合作中基础领域最广，合作潜力巨大。, 我们要全面看待两国经贸合作发展。中国连续7年保持俄罗斯第一大贸易伙伴地位。去年，中俄经贸合作克服世界经济不景气、原油等大宗商品价格波动等不利因素影响，实现止跌回升，双边贸易额达到695.3亿美元、同比增长2.2%。今年前5个月，双边贸易进一步提速，增幅达到26%，全年贸易额有望超过800亿美元。, 尤其是两国经贸合作的结构不断优化，呈现不少新增长点。一是机电和高新技术产品保持快速增长，今年第一季度增幅分别为20.8%和19.4%。二是投资合作效应正在逐步显现。两国政府间投资合作委员会今年确定了新一批73个合作项目清单，部分项目正在按计划实施。三是金融合作深入推进。俄罗斯央行在中国设立首家海外代表处。俄罗斯企业成为“一带一路”沿线首家在中国成功发行熊猫债券的企业。中方宣布设立总规模为1000亿元人民币的中俄地区合作发展投资基金，用于促进中国东北地区和俄罗斯远东地区合作。四是农产品贸易发展迅速。中方欢迎更多俄罗斯优质农产品进入中国市场。五是远东开发合作提速。中国已成为俄罗斯远东地区第一大贸易伙伴，双方在资源深加工、港口物流、现代农业、基础设施建设等领域积极推进一批有潜力的合作项目。六是中俄能源、核能、航空、航天、跨境基础设施建设等领域战略性大项目稳步推进，比如，东线天然气管道建设进展顺利，中国企业积极参与亚马尔液化气项目建设，远程宽体客机合资公司已于今年5月在上海挂牌成立。, 当然，中俄相互投资规模有待扩大、中小企业合作发展还需加快，需要双方共同努力。双方要加强传统经贸合作，包括中方自俄罗斯进口油气、煤炭、电力、锯材等大宗商品，扩大双边本币结算，落实好商定投资项目，充分用好中俄博览会、圣彼得堡国际经济论坛、东方经济论坛等展会平台作用，挖掘中俄“长江—伏尔加河”、“东北—远东”等地方和边境地区经贸合作潜力。, 中俄两国发展离不开欧亚大陆发展，也将以自身发展促进欧亚大陆发展。今年5月，普京总统来华出席“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛期间表示支持并愿积极参与“一带一路”建设。中俄两国正在积极推进“一带一路”建设同欧亚经济联盟对接合作。在对接合作框架内，双方正在积极商谈中国同欧亚经济联盟经贸合作协议和对接合作项目清单。这将为两国经贸合作开拓更加广阔的发展空间，有助于提升两国贸易和投资便利化水平，为两国企业家创造更多新的合作机遇，实现产业、技术、资本、市场等有效流通，使欧亚各国在经济全球化和区域一体化进程中实现利益共享。, 在双边大项目合作层面，双方要坚持推进能源领域上下游一体化合作。战略性大项目是两国经贸合作的基石，其综合效益和战略效果不能用简单的数字体现和衡量，双方要开展更多联合研制、联合生产、推广应用等合作。, 在互联互通层面，我们欢迎并愿积极参与俄方提出的共同开发建设滨海国际运输走廊建议，希望双方早日建成同江铁路桥、黑河公路桥等重大跨境基础设施，共同开发和利用海上通道特别是北极航道，打造“冰上丝绸之路”。这些互联互通领域的合作将为促进两国经贸合作深入发展提供新动能。, 中小企业是国家经济增长的重要支撑，也是推动社会创新和创造大量就业的积极要素。两国政府要为中小企业合作创造有利条件，调动他们合作的积极性，使大企业和中小企业同步发展、相互促进，并共同开拓第三国市场。, 总之，我和普京总统都认为，中俄两国要深化经贸合作，筑牢共同利益纽带，同时要着眼长远，弘扬相互扩大开放、开展互利合作精神，着眼提升两国综合国力和国际竞争力，使合作成果更多惠及两国人民。, 三、问：今年5月您成功主持召开了“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，您对这次高峰论坛成果有何评价？对“一带一路”建设未来发展前景有何期待？您如何评价俄罗斯在“一带一路”建设中的作用？, 答：“一带一路”倡议是我在2013年访问中亚和东南亚时提出来的，目的是通过加强国际合作，对接彼此发展战略，实现优势互补，促进共同发展。近4年来，“一带一路”相关合作稳步推进，受到各方普遍欢迎和积极参与，取得了一批重要早期收获。在这一背景下，我们今年5月在北京成功举办“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，主要是总结过去、规划未来。来自29个国家的领导人和联合国、世界银行、国际货币基金组织的负责人，140多个国家和80多个国际组织的1600多名代表参加。各方围绕“加强国际合作，共建‘一带一路’，实现共赢发展”的主题，就加强政策协调和发展战略对接、深化伙伴关系、推动互联互通、促进人文交流等议题深入交换意见。会议总结了“一带一路”合作进展，达成广泛共识，各方形成5大类、76大项、270多项具体成果，传递出各方打造合作平台、为世界经济增长谋求动力、为经济全球化发展提振信心的积极信号。, 我们将以此为契机，以共商、共建、共享为指导原则，推动各国政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通。加强政策协调和发展战略对接，把互联互通作为重点合作领域，支持加快经济走廊建设，推进国际产能和装备制造合作，促进教育、科技、文化、医疗卫生等领域合作，共同挖掘经济增长新动力，实现各国共同发展，努力打造人类命运共同体。, 俄罗斯总统普京是最早接受我邀请参加高峰论坛的领导人，体现了俄方对中方办会的重要支持和中俄关系的高水平。2015年5月，中俄双方就“一带一路”建设同欧亚经济联盟对接合作达成重要共识，得到欧亚经济联盟其他成员国积极响应支持。2年来，对接合作稳步开展，进展显著。中方愿同俄方一道努力，以推进“一带一路”建设同欧亚经济联盟对接为契机，继续推动中俄关系不断向前发展。, 四、问：能否请您简要介绍当前中国经济发展情况？您对即将召开的二十国集团领导人汉堡峰会有何期待？, 答：今年以来，中国经济延续了去年下半年以来稳中向好的发展态势。第一季度，中国国内生产总值增长6.9%，实现了良好开局。随着中国重要领域和关键环节深层次改革持续推进并落地见效，新动能培育和传统动能改造协同发力，中国经济将继续保持平稳较快增长。, 当前，世界经济增长势头进一步巩固，发达国家和新兴市场国家经济形势普遍向好，但也面临一些严峻挑战。在这一背景下，二十国集团继续发挥国际经济合作主要论坛作用、落实杭州峰会及历届峰会共识、引领世界经济前进方向尤为重要，也符合各方利益。中方对汉堡峰会有以下期待。, 一是希望二十国集团继续秉持同舟共济、合作共赢的伙伴精神。这种精神曾指引二十国集团走过国际金融危机风雨，也将继续鼓舞二十国集团引领世界经济浪潮。正如我在杭州峰会欢迎晚宴致辞中讲的，“只要我们彼此包容、守望相助，就能无论晴时好、雨时奇，都坚定前行，共抵彼岸”。, 二是希望二十国集团继续高举建设开放型世界经济的时代旗帜。作为世界经济的引领力量，二十国集团应该坚持开放发展，支持以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，推动贸易和投资继续发挥世界经济增长引擎作用。, 三是希望二十国集团继续引领创新增长、长效治理的发展路径。各国需要继续通过创新挖掘世界经济增长新动力，推动数字经济、新工业革命深入发展，加强基础设施建设投资，综合运用财政政策、货币政策、结构性改革，促进世界经济实现强劲、可持续、平衡、包容增长。, 5月在北京成功举行的“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，同今年汉堡峰会的主题——“塑造联动世界”高度契合。“一带一路”倡议和二十国集团合作可以相互补充、相互促进，共同促进世界经济增长。中方愿以汉堡峰会为契机，同各方一道努力，为促进世界经济增长、完善全球经济治理作出积极贡献。, 五、问：朝鲜半岛紧张局势长期未能得到有效缓和，国际社会高度关注半岛问题。中国认为应该如何解决这一问题？中国如何看待美国在韩国部署“萨德”反导系统的行动？, 答：中方高度关注半岛局势发展，坚持实现半岛无核化，坚持维护半岛和平稳定，坚持通过对话协商解决问题。半岛问题由来已久，错综复杂，解决起来必须坚持标本兼治，兼顾各方合理关切。为此，中方提出实现半岛无核化和建立半岛和平机制“双轨并行”思路，以及朝鲜暂停核导活动和美韩两国暂停大规模联合军演“双暂停”倡议。俄方明确予以理解和支持，中俄双方有着相同和相近的立场，国际社会也越来越多地作出积极回应。希望半岛问题相关各方呼应中俄双方的劝和促谈努力，负起各自应负责任，互释善意，相向而行，争取早日将半岛问题纳入对话协商解决的正确轨道。, 美国在韩国部署“萨德”反导系统严重损害包括中俄在内域内国家战略安全利益，破坏地区战略平衡，无助于实现朝鲜半岛无核化目标和地区和平稳定。中方已对此表明坚决反对立场和严正关切。中俄在各层级就“萨德”问题保持密切沟通和协调，双方对这一问题本质和危害的认识高度一致。中俄坚决反对美国在韩国部署“萨德”反导系统，强烈敦促有关国家停止并取消相关部署，双方将共同或各自采取必要措施，维护两国安全利益和地区战略平衡。, 六、问：国际社会高度关注叙利亚问题，中方认为应该如何解决这一问题？您如何评价俄方在叙利亚问题上的作用？, 答：叙利亚问题是当前中东最为复杂难解的热点问题，给叙利亚人民带来了深重苦难，也给地区和世界和平稳定带来严峻挑战。, 在叙利亚问题上，中方的立场是一贯的，主张叙利亚主权独立、领土完整应当得到维护和尊重，叙利亚国家未来应该由叙利亚人民自主决定，认为政治解决是叙利亚问题的唯一现实出路。我们真诚希望叙利亚问题尽快得到妥善解决，希望叙利亚人民企盼和平的愿望早日实现，能够重返并重建家园。, 近来，叙利亚问题出现积极势头。有关各方在阿斯塔纳对话会上签署备忘录，同意在叙利亚设立冲突降级区。联合国方面主持的日内瓦和谈持续推进。中方主张，当前形势下，国际社会要维护来之不易的叙利亚问题政治解决势头，支持联合国继续发挥斡旋主渠道作用，推动叙利亚政府和反对派展现诚意、耐心协商，努力达成兼顾各方合理关切的政治解决方案。有关各方还应该加强协调，形成合力，在国际法框架内有效打击叙利亚境内的恐怖主义。, 俄方为推动叙利亚问题妥善解决发挥了重要、积极影响和作用，中方对此表示赞赏。, 七、问：恐怖主义是世界安全和发展的现实威胁。您如何评价俄中两国在打击“三股势力”方面的合作？, 答：近期，全球反恐形势深刻演变，国际恐怖活动持续活跃。今年以来，许多国家接连遭受严重恐怖袭击，造成大量人员伤亡。各方面情况表明，尽管国际社会军事打恐取得一定进展，但全球恐怖活动仍将多发频发，对世界和平、稳定、发展构成持续冲击，应对恐怖主义威胁仍是全球安全治理的一个突出难题。, 面对严峻的恐怖威胁，国际社会命运共同体意识在增强，反恐共识不断增多，合作打击恐怖主义取得重要成效。但是，问题依然突出：一是恐怖主义同热点问题叠加共振，成为国际社会“越反越恐”的重要原因。二是国际恐怖组织号召并策划在全球各地发动更多恐怖袭击。三是暴力恐怖思想通过网络和社交媒体在全球持续蔓延，其深层次影响将不断显现。四是一些国家仍将反恐作为推进本国利益的手段，在反恐上奉行双重标准，导致反恐国际合作工具化、碎片化，难成合力。, 中方一直以建设性方式支持国际社会打击恐怖主义的努力。我们认为，开展反恐国际合作，一是要摒弃“双重标准”，充分发挥联合国在国际反恐斗争中的主导作用，矢志一心，形成合力；二是要妥善解决地区热点问题，帮助叙利亚等中东国家尽快恢复稳定，遏制住恐怖主义蔓延猖獗之势；三是要着眼长远，综合施策，标本兼治，政治、经济、文化等多措并举，从源头肃清恐怖主义滋生的温床。, 中国和俄罗斯都是恐怖主义受害者。两国在反恐安全领域的合作是中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系的重要组成部分，为国际反恐合作树立了典范。这既符合两国根本利益，也有利于本地区乃至世界和平稳定。双方通过执法安全合作机制，在打击恐怖主义、分裂主义、极端主义“三股势力”等领域开展了良好合作，为维护两国和本地区稳定发展发挥了重要积极作用。中方愿同俄方深化双边务实合作，加大在彼此反恐核心关切上的相互支持，同时密切在联合国、上海合作组织等多边框架内协调和配合，坚持联合国在反恐国际合作中的主导作用，推动上海合作组织等机制反恐安全合作不断走向深入，共同推动反恐国际合作取得更大进展。（新华社北京7月3日电）, 《 人民日报 》（ 2017年07月04日 01 版）, ]",习近平接受俄罗斯媒体采访,http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/29380500
23,160,"[, Dear Heads of State, Heads of Government,, Heads of International Organizations,, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Friends:, ""Meng Xia Day, All Things Show."" At this beautiful time, more than 100 countries Guests from all walks of life gathered in Beijing to discuss the ""Belt and Road"" construction cooperation plan, which is of great significance. Today, the talents are the best, and the young and the long have gathered. I look forward to everyone's brainstorming and free speech, and suggestions for promoting the construction of the ""Belt and Road"", so that this century project will benefit the people of all countries. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , More than 2000 years ago, our ancestors passed through the grasslands and deserts, opening up the land-based Silk Road connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa; our ancestors sailed through the stormy seas and the sea silk road connecting the East and the West. The ancient Silk Road opened a new window for friendly exchanges between countries and wrote a new chapter in human development and progress. The millennium ""gilt bronze silkworm"" collected by China's Shaanxi History Museum and the millennium shipwreck ""Black Stone"" discovered in Indonesia have witnessed this history. The ancient Silk Road stretches for thousands of miles and lasts for thousands of years. It has accumulated the Silk Road spirit centered on peaceful cooperation, openness and tolerance, mutual learning and mutual benefit, and mutual benefit and win-win. This is a precious legacy of human civilization. ,-Peaceful cooperation. In the Han Dynasty of China more than 140 BC, a peace mission from Changan began to open up the road from the east to the west, and completed the ""cutting journey"". This is the famous Zhang Qian's mission to the Western Region. During the Tang, Song, and Yuan Dynasties of China, the land and sea Silk Road developed simultaneously. Travellers Du Huan, Marco Polo, and Ibn Battuta of China, Italy, and Morocco all stayed on land and the Sea Silk Road. A historical mark. In the early 15th century, the Ming Dynasty, the famous Chinese navigator Zheng He made seven ocean-going voyages, leaving behind the long story. The reason why these pioneering careers became famous is because they did not use war horses and spears, but camel teams and goodwill; they did not rely on strong ships and artillery, but treasure ships and friendship. Generations of ""Silk Road People"" have built a bond of cooperation and a bridge of peace between East and West. , ——Open and inclusive. The ancient Silk Road spans the Nile River Basin, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, the Indus and Ganges River Basins, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Basin, spans the birthplace of Egyptian civilization, Babylonian civilization, Indian civilization, and Chinese civilization, and spans the congregation of believers in Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Place, a settlement that spans people of different countries and colors. Different civilizations, religions, and races seek common ground while reserving differences, and are open and inclusive. They write magnificent poems of mutual respect, and draw together a beautiful picture of common development. Ancient cities such as Jiuquan, Dunhuang, Turpan, Kashgar, Samarkand, Baghdad, Constantinople, and ancient ports in Ningbo, Quanzhou, Guangzhou, Beihai, Colombo, Jeddah, Alexandria, etc. are the “living fossils” that record this history "". History tells us: civilization develops in openness, and nations coexist in integration. , —— mutual learning and mutual learning. The ancient Silk Road is not only a way of trading goods, but also a road of knowledge exchange. Along the ancient Silk Road, China spread silk, porcelain, lacquer, and iron to the West, and also brought pepper, flax, spices, grapes, and pomegranates to China. Along the ancient Silk Road, Buddhism, Islam, and Arabic astronomy, calendar, and medicine were introduced into China, and China's four major inventions and sericulture techniques were also spread to the world. More importantly, the exchange of commodities and knowledge has brought about innovative ideas. For example, Buddhism originated in India, flourished in China, and inherited in Southeast Asia. Confucian culture originated in China and was respected by European thinkers such as Leibniz and Voltaire. This is the result of the charm of exchanges and mutual learning. , —— Mutual benefit and win-win. The ancient Silk Road has witnessed the grandeur of ""land envoys looking at the road, business travel is endless"" on land, and witnessed the prosperity of ""shipping in the sea, and countless"" at sea. In this great artery, capital, technology, personnel and other production factors flow freely, and commodities, resources and achievements are shared. Almaty, Samarkand, Chang'an and other important towns and Sur Port, Guangzhou and other good ports are thriving, Rome, Anxi, Guishuang and other ancient countries are flourishing, and Han and Tang Dynasties in China are ushering in a prosperous age. The ancient Silk Road created great development and prosperity in the region. , History is the best teacher. This history shows that no matter how far apart we are, as long as we bravely take the first step and stick to each other, we will be able to walk out of a road of encounter, mutual understanding, and common development, and move towards a happy, peaceful, harmonious and beautiful distance. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! From a historical perspective, human society is in an era of great development, big changes, and big adjustments. The world's multi-polarization, economic globalization, social informatization, and cultural diversification are developing in depth. The trend of peaceful development is becoming stronger and stronger. The pace of reform and innovation continues to move forward. By countryEconomic globalization, social informatization, and cultural diversification are developing in depth. The trend of peaceful development is becoming stronger and stronger, and the pace of reform and innovation continues to move forward. The connections between countries have never been as close as they are today, the world’s people’s longing for a better life has never been as strong as today, and the means by which humans have overcome difficulties have never been as rich as they are today. From a practical perspective, we are in a world where challenges are frequent. The world's economic growth requires new impetus, development needs a more inclusive balance, and the gap between the rich and the poor needs to be bridged. Regional hotspots continue to be turbulent and terrorism spreads and rages. Peace deficits, development deficits, and governance deficits are serious challenges before all mankind. This is the question I have been thinking about. , In the fall of 2013, I proposed the joint construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in Kazakhstan and Indonesia, the “Belt and Road” initiative. ""Don't say anything, you will do what you want."" Over the past four years, more than 100 countries and international organizations around the world have actively supported and participated in the construction of the ""Belt and Road."" Important resolutions such as the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council have also been incorporated into the construction of the ""Belt and Road."" The construction of the “Belt and Road” has gradually transformed from concept to action, and from vision to reality, with fruitful construction results. -This is the 4 years of continuous deepening of policy communication. I have said many times that the construction of the “Belt and Road” is not a start-up and a comeback, but a strategic integration and complementary advantages. We coordinate policies with relevant countries, including the Eurasian Economic Union proposed by Russia, the Master Plan for Connectivity proposed by ASEAN, the ""Light Path"" proposed by Kazakhstan, the ""Middle Corridor"" proposed by Turkey, and the ""Development Road"" proposed by Mongolia The “two corridors and one circle” proposed by Vietnam, the “Economic Centre of Northern England” proposed by the United Kingdom, and the “Amber Road” proposed by Poland. China's planning and docking work with Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Hungary and other countries has also begun. China has signed cooperation agreements with more than 40 countries and international organizations, and cooperated with more than 30 countries on institutionalized production capacity. During this forum, we will also sign a batch of docking cooperation agreements and action plans, and jointly issue more than 60 countries and international organizations to promote the “Belt and Road” trade smooth cooperation initiative. All parties have achieved the effect of ""one plus one is greater than two"" through policy docking. , ——This is the 4 years of continuous improvement of facility connectivity. ""Roads are open, all industries are prosperous."" Together with relevant countries, we will accelerate the progress of the Yawan High Speed ​​Rail, the China-Laos Railway, the Yaji Railway, the Hungary-Serbia Railway, etc., and build ports such as Gwadar Port and Piraeus Port. A large number of interconnection projects. At present, a composite infrastructure is led by China-Pakistan, China-Mongolia-Russia, New Asia-Europe Continental Bridge and other economic corridors, with land, sea and air passages and information highways as the skeleton, relying on major projects such as railways, ports, and pipeline networks. The network is forming. -This is the 4 years of uninterrupted and continuous improvement of trade. China and the participating countries along the “Belt and Road” have vigorously promoted trade and investment facilitation, and continuously improved the business environment. I learned that the customs clearance time for agricultural products from Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan to reach the Chinese market has been shortened by 90%. From 2014 to 2016, China's total trade with countries along the “Belt and Road” exceeded US$3 trillion. China's cumulative investment in countries along the ""Belt and Road"" has exceeded US$50 billion. Chinese companies have built 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in more than 20 countries, creating nearly US$1.1 billion in taxes and 180,000 jobs for the countries concerned. , ——This is the 4 years of continuous expansion of capital finance. The financing bottleneck is a prominent challenge to achieve interconnection. China has carried out various forms of financial cooperation with participating countries and organizations in the Belt and Road Initiative. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has provided US$1.7 billion in loans to nine projects in the participating countries of the “Belt and Road” initiative. The “Silk Road Fund” has invested US$4 billion. China and Central and Eastern Europe “16+1” financial holding companies have been formally established. These new types of financial mechanisms and the traditional multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank each have their own emphasis and complement each other, forming a “Belt and Road” financial cooperation network with clear levels and initial scale. , ——This is the 4 years of continuous promotion of people-to-people communication. ""The friendship between the nations lies in the mutual friendship between the people, and the mutual friendship lies in the closeness of the hearts."" The participating countries in the construction of the ""Belt and Road"" promote the spirit of the Silk Road, carry out the construction of the intellectual Silk Road and the healthy Silk Road, etc., in science, education, culture, health, folk Extensive cooperation in various fields, such as exchanges, has laid a solid foundation for public opinion for the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative and laid a solid foundation for society. The Chinese government provides 10,000 government scholarships to relevant countries every year, and local governments have also set up special Silk Road scholarships to encourage international cultural and educational exchanges. Various cultural cooperation projects such as the Silk Road Cultural Year, Tourism Year, Art Festival, Film and Television Bridge, Seminars, Think Tank Dialogue, etc. are full of flowers. People exchange frequently, and the distance between hearts is reduced in the exchange. , FengHumanities cooperation projects such as festivals, film and television bridges, seminars, think tank dialogues, and so on, are full of flowers. People exchange frequently, and the heart-to-heart distance is narrowed in the exchange. The fruitful results show that the “Belt and Road” initiative conforms to the trend of the times, adapts to the development laws, conforms to the interests of people of all countries, and has broad prospects. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The Chinese say, ""Everything is difficult at first."" The ""Belt and Road"" construction has taken solid steps. We must take advantage of the trend and follow the trend to promote the construction of the “Belt and Road” to a stable future and move towards a better future. Here, I have a few comments. First, we must build the “Belt and Road” into a road of peace. The ancient Silk Road, and fashionable, decline in wartime. The construction of the “Belt and Road” is inseparable from a peaceful environment. We must build a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core, and build partnerships where dialogues are not confrontational and partnerships are not alliances. Countries should respect each other's sovereignty, dignity, territorial integrity, respect each other's development path and social system, and respect each other's core interests and major concerns. The area along the ancient Silk Road used to be ""a place where milk and honey flowed"", but now many places have become synonymous with conflict and turmoil and crisis challenges. This situation cannot continue. We must establish a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable view of security, and create a shared and shared security landscape. We must focus on resolving hotspots and insist on political solutions; we must focus on mediating mediation and uphold fairness and justice; we must focus on advancing counter-terrorism, treating both the symptoms and root causes, and eliminating poverty and backwardness and social injustice. Second, we must build the “Belt and Road” into a road of prosperity. Development is the master key to solving all problems. To advance the construction of the “Belt and Road”, we must focus on the fundamental issue of development, unleash the development potential of all countries, and achieve economic integration, development linkage, and results sharing. , Industry is the foundation of the economy. We must carry out in-depth industrial cooperation, promote mutual compatibility and mutual promotion of industrial development plans of various countries, grasp the construction of large projects, strengthen international production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, seize the new development opportunities of the new industrial revolution, cultivate new formats, and maintain economic growth vitality . , Finance is the blood of modern economy. Only when the blood is connected can growth be powerful. We need to establish a stable, sustainable, and risk-controllable financial security system, innovate investment and financing models, promote government and social capital cooperation, build a diversified financing system and multi-level capital market, develop inclusive finance, and improve financial service networks. , Facilities connectivity is the basis for cooperative development. We must focus on promoting the connectivity of land, sea, sky, and the Internet, focusing on key channels, key cities, and key projects, and connecting land roads, railway road networks, and sea port networks. We have established the framework for the construction of six economic corridors under the “Belt and Road” initiative, and we must move forward in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to seize the new round of energy structure adjustment and energy technology reform trends, build a global energy Internet, and achieve green and low-carbon development. It is necessary to improve the construction of cross-regional logistics networks. We must also promote the integration of policies, rules, and standards to provide a mechanism guarantee for interconnection. Thirdly, we will build the “Belt and Road” into an open road. Openness brings progress, and closure leads to backwardness. For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience temporary pains, it will bring new life. The construction of the “Belt and Road” should be guided by opening up to solve the problems of economic growth and balance. , We must build an open cooperation platform, maintain and develop an open world economy, jointly create an environment conducive to open development, promote the establishment of a fair, reasonable and transparent international economic and trade investment rules system, and promote the orderly flow of production elements and efficient allocation of resources 3. Deep market integration. We welcome countries to actively develop an open economy based on their own national conditions, participate in global governance and the supply of public products, and work together to build a broad community of interests. , Trade is an important engine of economic growth. We must have a ""look out"" mind, maintain the multilateral trading system, promote the construction of free trade zones, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. Of course, we must also focus on solving problems such as development imbalances, governance dilemmas, the digital divide, and distribution gaps, and build an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win economic globalization. Fourth, we must build the “Belt and Road” into a road of innovation. Innovation is an important force driving development. The construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative is a pioneering initiative in itself, and innovation in the construction of the “Belt and Road Initiative” requires innovation. We must insist on innovation-driven development, strengthen cooperation in the frontier fields of digital economy, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computers, and promote the construction of big data, cloud computing, and smart cities, and connect into the 21st century digital silk road. We must promote the deep integration of technology and industry, and technology and finance, optimize the innovation environment, and gather innovation resources. We must create entrepreneurial space and entrepreneurial workshops for young people from all countries in the Internet age, and achieve the dreams of the future generation of youth. , we wantGather innovative resources. We must create entrepreneurial space and entrepreneurial workshops for young people from all countries in the Internet age, and achieve the dreams of the future generation of youth. , We must practice the new concept of green development, advocate green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable production and lifestyle, strengthen ecological and environmental protection cooperation, build an ecological civilization, and jointly achieve the 2030 sustainable development goals. Fifth, we must build the “Belt and Road” into a road of civilization. The construction of the ""Belt and Road"" must use civilization exchange to transcend civilization barriers, mutual civilization mutual learning to transcend civilization conflicts, coexistence of civilizations to transcend civilization superiority, and promote mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual trust among nations. , We must establish a multi-level humanities cooperation mechanism, build more cooperation platforms, and open up more cooperation channels. It is necessary to promote educational cooperation, expand the scale of exchange of international students, and raise the level of cooperation in running schools. We must play the role of think tanks and build a think tank alliance and cooperation network. In the fields of culture, sports, and health, we must innovate cooperation models and promote pragmatic projects. It is necessary to make good use of historical and cultural heritage and jointly create tourism products and heritage protection with Silk Road characteristics. We need to strengthen exchanges between parliaments, political parties, and non-governmental organizations in various countries, and strengthen communication between groups such as women, youth, and the disabled to promote inclusive development. We must also strengthen international anti-corruption cooperation and make the “Belt and Road” a path of integrity. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! At present, China's development is at a new starting point. We will deeply implement the innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development concept, continuously adapt, grasp and lead the new normal of economic development, actively promote the supply-side structural reform, achieve sustainable development, and inject strong power into the “Belt and Road” initiative. World development brings new opportunities. -China is willing to develop friendly cooperation with all participating countries on the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China is willing to share development experience with other countries in the world, but it will not interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, export social systems and development models, and will not impose on others. We are advancing the construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative that will not repeat the old geopolitical game, but will create a new model of cooperation and win-win; it will not form a destabilizing small group, but will build a harmonious coexisting family. ——China has reached practical cooperation agreements with many countries on the “Belt and Road”, which includes not only transportation, infrastructure, energy and other hardware connectivity projects, but also communications, customs, inspection and quarantine and other software connectivity projects, as well as economic and trade, Cooperative planning and specific projects in various fields such as industry, e-commerce, ocean and green economy. China and the railway departments of relevant countries will sign an agreement to deepen China-EU train cooperation. We will promote the early start of these cooperative projects and see results early. -China will increase its funding support for the construction of the ""Belt and Road"", add 100 billion yuan to the Silk Road Fund, and encourage financial institutions to develop RMB overseas fund business. The scale is expected to be about 300 billion yuan. The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank will provide RMB 250 billion and 130 billion yuan worth of special loans respectively to support the construction of the “Belt and Road” infrastructure, production capacity and financial cooperation. We will also cooperate with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the BRICS New Development Bank, the World Bank and other multilateral development agencies to support the “Belt and Road” project, and work with relevant parties to formulate the “Belt and Road” financing guidelines. -China will actively develop mutually beneficial and economic and trade partnerships with participating countries along the ""Belt and Road"", promote trade and investment facilitation with relevant countries, and build a ""Belt and Road"" free trade network to help regional and world economic growth.

   发布时间：2017-05-15,"[, 尊敬的各位国家元首，政府首脑，, 各位国际组织负责人，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, “孟夏之日，万物并秀。”在这美好时节，来自100多个国家的各界嘉宾齐聚北京，共商“一带一路”建设合作大计，具有十分重要的意义。今天，群贤毕至，少长咸集，我期待着大家集思广益、畅所欲言，为推动“一带一路”建设献计献策，让这一世纪工程造福各国人民。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 2000多年前，我们的先辈筚路蓝缕，穿越草原沙漠，开辟出联通亚欧非的陆上丝绸之路；我们的先辈扬帆远航，穿越惊涛骇浪，闯荡出连接东西方的海上丝绸之路。古丝绸之路打开了各国友好交往的新窗口，书写了人类发展进步的新篇章。中国陕西历史博物馆珍藏的千年“鎏金铜蚕”，在印度尼西亚发现的千年沉船“黑石号”等，见证了这段历史。, 古丝绸之路绵亘万里，延续千年，积淀了以和平合作、开放包容、互学互鉴、互利共赢为核心的丝路精神。这是人类文明的宝贵遗产。, ——和平合作。公元前140多年的中国汉代，一支从长安出发的和平使团，开始打通东方通往西方的道路，完成了“凿空之旅”，这就是著名的张骞出使西域。中国唐宋元时期，陆上和海上丝绸之路同步发展，中国、意大利、摩洛哥的旅行家杜环、马可·波罗、伊本·白图泰都在陆上和海上丝绸之路留下了历史印记。15世纪初的明代，中国著名航海家郑和七次远洋航海，留下千古佳话。这些开拓事业之所以名垂青史，是因为使用的不是战马和长矛，而是驼队和善意；依靠的不是坚船和利炮，而是宝船和友谊。一代又一代“丝路人”架起了东西方合作的纽带、和平的桥梁。, ——开放包容。古丝绸之路跨越尼罗河流域、底格里斯河和幼发拉底河流域、印度河和恒河流域、黄河和长江流域，跨越埃及文明、巴比伦文明、印度文明、中华文明的发祥地，跨越佛教、基督教、伊斯兰教信众的汇集地，跨越不同国度和肤色人民的聚居地。不同文明、宗教、种族求同存异、开放包容，并肩书写相互尊重的壮丽诗篇，携手绘就共同发展的美好画卷。酒泉、敦煌、吐鲁番、喀什、撒马尔罕、巴格达、君士坦丁堡等古城，宁波、泉州、广州、北海、科伦坡、吉达、亚历山大等地的古港，就是记载这段历史的“活化石”。历史告诉我们：文明在开放中发展，民族在融合中共存。, ——互学互鉴。古丝绸之路不仅是一条通商易货之道，更是一条知识交流之路。沿着古丝绸之路，中国将丝绸、瓷器、漆器、铁器传到西方，也为中国带来了胡椒、亚麻、香料、葡萄、石榴。沿着古丝绸之路，佛教、伊斯兰教及阿拉伯的天文、历法、医药传入中国，中国的四大发明、养蚕技术也由此传向世界。更为重要的是，商品和知识交流带来了观念创新。比如，佛教源自印度，在中国发扬光大，在东南亚得到传承。儒家文化起源中国，受到欧洲莱布尼茨、伏尔泰等思想家的推崇。这是交流的魅力、互鉴的成果。, ——互利共赢。古丝绸之路见证了陆上“使者相望于道，商旅不绝于途”的盛况，也见证了海上“舶交海中，不知其数”的繁华。在这条大动脉上，资金、技术、人员等生产要素自由流动，商品、资源、成果等实现共享。阿拉木图、撒马尔罕、长安等重镇和苏尔港、广州等良港兴旺发达，罗马、安息、贵霜等古国欣欣向荣，中国汉唐迎来盛世。古丝绸之路创造了地区大发展大繁荣。, 历史是最好的老师。这段历史表明，无论相隔多远，只要我们勇敢迈出第一步，坚持相向而行，就能走出一条相遇相知、共同发展之路，走向幸福安宁和谐美好的远方。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 从历史维度看，人类社会正处在一个大发展大变革大调整时代。世界多极化、经济全球化、社会信息化、文化多样化深入发展，和平发展的大势日益强劲，变革创新的步伐持续向前。各国之间的联系从来没有像今天这样紧密，世界人民对美好生活的向往从来没有像今天这样强烈，人类战胜困难的手段从来没有像今天这样丰富。, 从现实维度看，我们正处在一个挑战频发的世界。世界经济增长需要新动力，发展需要更加普惠平衡，贫富差距鸿沟有待弥合。地区热点持续动荡，恐怖主义蔓延肆虐。和平赤字、发展赤字、治理赤字，是摆在全人类面前的严峻挑战。这是我一直思考的问题。, 2013年秋天，我在哈萨克斯坦和印度尼西亚提出共建丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路，即“一带一路”倡议。“桃李不言，下自成蹊。”4年来，全球100多个国家和国际组织积极支持和参与“一带一路”建设，联合国大会、联合国安理会等重要决议也纳入“一带一路”建设内容。“一带一路”建设逐渐从理念转化为行动，从愿景转变为现实，建设成果丰硕。, ——这是政策沟通不断深化的4年。我多次说过，“一带一路”建设不是另起炉灶、推倒重来，而是实现战略对接、优势互补。我们同有关国家协调政策，包括俄罗斯提出的欧亚经济联盟、东盟提出的互联互通总体规划、哈萨克斯坦提出的“光明之路”、土耳其提出的“中间走廊”、蒙古提出的“发展之路”、越南提出的“两廊一圈”、英国提出的“英格兰北方经济中心”、波兰提出的“琥珀之路”等。中国同老挝、柬埔寨、缅甸、匈牙利等国的规划对接工作也全面展开。中国同40多个国家和国际组织签署了合作协议，同30多个国家开展机制化产能合作。本次论坛期间，我们还将签署一批对接合作协议和行动计划，同60多个国家和国际组织共同发出推进“一带一路”贸易畅通合作倡议。各方通过政策对接，实现了“一加一大于二”的效果。, ——这是设施联通不断加强的4年。“道路通，百业兴。”我们和相关国家一道共同加速推进雅万高铁、中老铁路、亚吉铁路、匈塞铁路等项目，建设瓜达尔港、比雷埃夫斯港等港口，规划实施一大批互联互通项目。目前，以中巴、中蒙俄、新亚欧大陆桥等经济走廊为引领，以陆海空通道和信息高速路为骨架，以铁路、港口、管网等重大工程为依托，一个复合型的基础设施网络正在形成。, ——这是贸易畅通不断提升的4年。中国同“一带一路”参与国大力推动贸易和投资便利化，不断改善营商环境。我了解到，仅哈萨克斯坦等中亚国家农产品到达中国市场的通关时间就缩短了90%。2014年至2016年，中国同“一带一路”沿线国家贸易总额超过3万亿美元。中国对“一带一路”沿线国家投资累计超过500亿美元。中国企业已经在20多个国家建设56个经贸合作区，为有关国家创造近11亿美元税收和18万个就业岗位。, ——这是资金融通不断扩大的4年。融资瓶颈是实现互联互通的突出挑战。中国同“一带一路”建设参与国和组织开展了多种形式的金融合作。亚洲基础设施投资银行已经为“一带一路”建设参与国的9个项目提供17亿美元贷款，“丝路基金”投资达40亿美元，中国同中东欧“16+1”金融控股公司正式成立。这些新型金融机制同世界银行等传统多边金融机构各有侧重、互为补充，形成层次清晰、初具规模的“一带一路”金融合作网络。, ——这是民心相通不断促进的4年。“国之交在于民相亲，民相亲在于心相通。”“一带一路”建设参与国弘扬丝绸之路精神，开展智力丝绸之路、健康丝绸之路等建设，在科学、教育、文化、卫生、民间交往等各领域广泛开展合作，为“一带一路”建设夯实民意基础，筑牢社会根基。中国政府每年向相关国家提供1万个政府奖学金名额，地方政府也设立了丝绸之路专项奖学金，鼓励国际文教交流。各类丝绸之路文化年、旅游年、艺术节、影视桥、研讨会、智库对话等人文合作项目百花纷呈，人们往来频繁，在交流中拉近了心与心的距离。, 丰硕的成果表明，“一带一路”倡议顺应时代潮流，适应发展规律，符合各国人民利益，具有广阔前景。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国人说，“万事开头难”。“一带一路”建设已经迈出坚实步伐。我们要乘势而上、顺势而为，推动“一带一路”建设行稳致远，迈向更加美好的未来。这里，我谈几点意见。, 第一，我们要将“一带一路”建成和平之路。古丝绸之路，和时兴，战时衰。“一带一路”建设离不开和平安宁的环境。我们要构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造对话不对抗、结伴不结盟的伙伴关系。各国应该尊重彼此主权、尊严、领土完整，尊重彼此发展道路和社会制度，尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切。, 古丝绸之路沿线地区曾经是“流淌着牛奶与蜂蜜的地方”，如今很多地方却成了冲突动荡和危机挑战的代名词。这种状况不能再持续下去。我们要树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观，营造共建共享的安全格局。要着力化解热点，坚持政治解决；要着力斡旋调解，坚持公道正义；要着力推进反恐，标本兼治，消除贫困落后和社会不公。, 第二，我们要将“一带一路”建成繁荣之路。发展是解决一切问题的总钥匙。推进“一带一路”建设，要聚焦发展这个根本性问题，释放各国发展潜力，实现经济大融合、发展大联动、成果大共享。, 产业是经济之本。我们要深入开展产业合作，推动各国产业发展规划相互兼容、相互促进，抓好大项目建设，加强国际产能和装备制造合作，抓住新工业革命的发展新机遇，培育新业态，保持经济增长活力。, 金融是现代经济的血液。血脉通，增长才有力。我们要建立稳定、可持续、风险可控的金融保障体系，创新投资和融资模式，推广政府和社会资本合作，建设多元化融资体系和多层次资本市场，发展普惠金融，完善金融服务网络。, 设施联通是合作发展的基础。我们要着力推动陆上、海上、天上、网上四位一体的联通，聚焦关键通道、关键城市、关键项目，联结陆上公路、铁路道路网络和海上港口网络。我们已经确立“一带一路”建设六大经济走廊框架，要扎扎实实向前推进。要抓住新一轮能源结构调整和能源技术变革趋势，建设全球能源互联网，实现绿色低碳发展。要完善跨区域物流网建设。我们也要促进政策、规则、标准三位一体的联通，为互联互通提供机制保障。, 第三，我们要将“一带一路”建成开放之路。开放带来进步，封闭导致落后。对一个国家而言，开放如同破茧成蝶，虽会经历一时阵痛，但将换来新生。“一带一路”建设要以开放为导向，解决经济增长和平衡问题。, 我们要打造开放型合作平台，维护和发展开放型世界经济，共同创造有利于开放发展的环境，推动构建公正、合理、透明的国际经贸投资规则体系，促进生产要素有序流动、资源高效配置、市场深度融合。我们欢迎各国结合自身国情，积极发展开放型经济，参与全球治理和公共产品供给，携手构建广泛的利益共同体。, 贸易是经济增长的重要引擎。我们要有“向外看”的胸怀，维护多边贸易体制，推动自由贸易区建设，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化。当然，我们也要着力解决发展失衡、治理困境、数字鸿沟、分配差距等问题，建设开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的经济全球化。, 第四，我们要将“一带一路”建成创新之路。创新是推动发展的重要力量。“一带一路”建设本身就是一个创举，搞好“一带一路”建设也要向创新要动力。, 我们要坚持创新驱动发展，加强在数字经济、人工智能、纳米技术、量子计算机等前沿领域合作，推动大数据、云计算、智慧城市建设，连接成21世纪的数字丝绸之路。我们要促进科技同产业、科技同金融深度融合，优化创新环境，集聚创新资源。我们要为互联网时代的各国青年打造创业空间、创业工场，成就未来一代的青春梦想。, 我们要践行绿色发展的新理念，倡导绿色、低碳、循环、可持续的生产生活方式，加强生态环保合作，建设生态文明，共同实现2030年可持续发展目标。, 第五，我们要将“一带一路”建成文明之路。“一带一路”建设要以文明交流超越文明隔阂、文明互鉴超越文明冲突、文明共存超越文明优越，推动各国相互理解、相互尊重、相互信任。, 我们要建立多层次人文合作机制，搭建更多合作平台，开辟更多合作渠道。要推动教育合作，扩大互派留学生规模，提升合作办学水平。要发挥智库作用，建设好智库联盟和合作网络。在文化、体育、卫生领域，要创新合作模式，推动务实项目。要用好历史文化遗产，联合打造具有丝绸之路特色的旅游产品和遗产保护。我们要加强各国议会、政党、民间组织往来，密切妇女、青年、残疾人等群体交流，促进包容发展。我们也要加强国际反腐合作，让“一带一路”成为廉洁之路。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 当前，中国发展正站在新的起点上。我们将深入贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念，不断适应、把握、引领经济发展新常态，积极推进供给侧结构性改革，实现持续发展，为“一带一路”注入强大动力，为世界发展带来新的机遇。, ——中国愿在和平共处五项原则基础上，发展同所有“一带一路”建设参与国的友好合作。中国愿同世界各国分享发展经验，但不会干涉他国内政，不会输出社会制度和发展模式，更不会强加于人。我们推进“一带一路”建设不会重复地缘博弈的老套路，而将开创合作共赢的新模式；不会形成破坏稳定的小集团，而将建设和谐共存的大家庭。, ——中国已经同很多国家达成了“一带一路”务实合作协议，其中既包括交通运输、基础设施、能源等硬件联通项目，也包括通信、海关、检验检疫等软件联通项目，还包括经贸、产业、电子商务、海洋和绿色经济等多领域的合作规划和具体项目。中国同有关国家的铁路部门将签署深化中欧班列合作协议。我们将推动这些合作项目早日启动、早见成效。, ——中国将加大对“一带一路”建设资金支持，向丝路基金新增资金1000亿元人民币，鼓励金融机构开展人民币海外基金业务，规模预计约3000亿元人民币。中国国家开发银行、进出口银行将分别提供2500亿元和1300亿元等值人民币专项贷款，用于支持“一带一路”基础设施建设、产能、金融合作。我们还将同亚洲基础设施投资银行、金砖国家新开发银行、世界银行及其他多边开发机构合作支持“一带一路”项目，同有关各方共同制定“一带一路”融资指导原则。, ——中国将积极同“一带一路”建设参与国发展互利共赢的经贸伙伴关系，促进同各相关国家贸易和投资便利化，建设“一带一路”自由贸易网络，助力地区和世界经济增长。本届论坛期间，中国将同30多个国家签署经贸合作协议，同有关国家协商自由贸易协定。中国将从2018年起举办中国国际进口博览会。, ——中国愿同各国加强创新合作，启动“一带一路”科技创新行动计划，开展科技人文交流、共建联合实验室、科技园区合作、技术转移4项行动。我们将在未来5年内安排2500人次青年科学家来华从事短期科研工作，培训5000人次科学技术和管理人员，投入运行50家联合实验室。我们将设立生态环保大数据服务平台，倡议建立“一带一路”绿色发展国际联盟，并为相关国家应对气候变化提供援助。, ——中国将在未来3年向参与“一带一路”建设的发展中国家和国际组织提供600亿元人民币援助，建设更多民生项目。我们将向“一带一路”沿线发展中国家提供20亿元人民币紧急粮食援助，向南南合作援助基金增资10亿美元，在沿线国家实施100个“幸福家园”、100个“爱心助困”、100个“康复助医”等项目。我们将向有关国际组织提供10亿美元落实一批惠及沿线国家的合作项目。, ——中国将设立“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛后续联络机制，成立“一带一路”财经发展研究中心、“一带一路”建设促进中心，同多边开发银行共同设立多边开发融资合作中心，同国际货币基金组织合作建立能力建设中心。我们将建设丝绸之路沿线民间组织合作网络，打造新闻合作联盟、音乐教育联盟以及其他人文合作新平台。, “一带一路”建设植根于丝绸之路的历史土壤，重点面向亚欧非大陆，同时向所有朋友开放。不论来自亚洲、欧洲，还是非洲、美洲，都是“一带一路”建设国际合作的伙伴。“一带一路”建设将由大家共同商量，“一带一路”建设成果将由大家共同分享。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国古语讲：“不积跬步，无以至千里。”阿拉伯谚语说，“金字塔是一块块石头垒成的”。欧洲也有句话：“伟业非一日之功”。“一带一路”建设是伟大的事业，需要伟大的实践。让我们一步一个脚印推进实施，一点一滴抓出成果，造福世界，造福人民！, 祝本次高峰论坛圆满成功！, 谢谢大家。, （新华社北京5月14日电） , 《 人民日报 》（ 2017年05月15日 03 版）,

24,161,"[, Dear President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Thomson,, Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres,, Dear Director-General of the United Nations Headquarters in Geneva, Mr. Mueller,, Ladies and gentlemen, friends: Vientiane update. I am very happy to have come to the UN headquarters in Geneva at the beginning of the New Year to discuss with you the proposition of the era of building a community of shared future for mankind. , I just attended the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. In Davos, the parties generally mentioned in their speeches that the world today is full of uncertainty, and people are both looking forward to and confused about the future. What happened to the world, what should we do? This is a question that the whole world is thinking about, and it is also a question that I have been thinking about. , I think, to answer this question, we must first figure out the most basic question, where are we from, where are we now, and where will we go? Looking back at the recent history of more than 100 years, mankind has experienced bloody hot wars and cold cold wars, and has also made amazing developments and tremendous progress. Before the first half of the last century, mankind suffered two world wars. The most urgent wish of that generation was to avoid war and build peace. In the 1950s and 1960s, the colonial people generally awakened. Their strongest voice was to get rid of the shackles and strive for independence. After the end of the Cold War, the most earnest demands of all parties were to expand cooperation and common development. The common wish of all mankind for more than 100 years is peace and development. However, this task is far from being completed. We must follow the voices of the people, take over the baton of history, and continue to move forward on the marathon track of peace and development. , Human beings are in a period of great development, big changes and big adjustments. World multi-polarization and economic globalization are developing in depth, social informatization and cultural diversification are continuing to advance. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial revolution are gestating and growing. Countries are interconnected and interdependent. The global destiny is related to the common and interrelated. The rise far exceeds the growth of war factors, and the trend of the times of peace, development, cooperation and win-win situation is even stronger. At the same time, human beings are also in an era of endless challenges and increasing risks. The world's economic growth is weak, the financial crisis is overcast, the development gap is becoming increasingly prominent, military encounters occur from time to time, the cold war mentality and power politics are not separated, terrorism, refugee crisis, major infectious diseases, climate change and other non-traditional security threats Continue to spread. , There is only one earth in the universe, and mankind has a home. Mr. Hawking made a conjecture about ""parallel universes"", hoping to find a planet where the second humanoid can live in peace. When this wish will come true is still unknown. So far, the earth is the only home for mankind to survive, and cherishing and caring for the earth is the only choice for mankind. The dome of the Swiss Federal Building is engraved with the Latin inscription ""Everyone is me, I am everyone"". We have to be considerate of contemporary people, but also responsible for future generations. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! It is the expectation of the people of all countries and the due responsibility of our generation of politicians to allow peaceful fires to be passed on from generation to generation, to keep the momentum of development flowing, and to make the light of civilization shine. China's plan is to build a community with a shared future for mankind and achieve win-win sharing. , Idea leads action, direction decides way out. Throughout the history of modern times, the establishment of a fair and reasonable international order is the goal of mankind. From the principles of equality and sovereignty established by the Westphalian Peace Treaty more than 360 years ago, to the international humanitarian spirit established by the Geneva Conventions more than 150 years ago; from the four main purposes and seven principles clearly defined in the UN Charter more than 70 years ago, to The five principles of peaceful coexistence advocated by the Bandung Conference more than 60 years ago and the evolution of international relations have accumulated a series of recognized principles. These principles should become the basic obedience for the construction of a community of human destiny. Sovereignty and equality are the most important norms governing the relationship between nations over the centuries. They are also the primary principles that the United Nations and all agencies and organizations follow together. The true meaning of sovereign equality is that a country is big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and internal affairs are not allowed to interfere. They all have the right to choose their own social system and development path. In the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the Universal Postal Union, the International Organization for Migration, the International Labour Organization and other institutions, countries participate equally in decision-making, which constitutes the importance of improving global governance power. Under the new situation, we must uphold sovereign equality and promote equal rights, opportunities and rules in all countries. , Geneva witnessed the adoption of the final declaration of Indochina peace issue, witnessed the first reconciliation meeting between the leaders of the two confrontation camps during the Cold War, witnessedGeneva witnessed the adoption of the final declaration on the Indochina peace issue, the first reconciliation meeting between the leaders of the two confrontation camps during the Cold War, and the dialogue and negotiations on hot issues such as the Iranian nuclear issue and Syria. The enlightenment from history and reality is that communication and consultation is an effective way to resolve differences, and political negotiation is the fundamental way to resolve conflicts. As long as you have a sincere desire, uphold goodwill and show political wisdom, no matter how big the conflict is, you can resolve it, and no matter how thick the ice is, you can break it. , ""The law, the end of governance."" In Geneva, based on the UN Charter, countries have reached a series of international conventions and legal instruments in the fields of political security, trade development, social human rights, science and technology, labor rights, culture and sports. The life of the law lies in putting it into practice. It is the responsibility of all countries to maintain the authority of the international rule of law, exercise their rights in accordance with the law, and perform their obligations in good faith. The life of the law also lies in fairness and justice. Countries and international judicial institutions should ensure that international law is applied uniformly and uniformly, without double standards, and if they are used together, they are abandoned. , ""Hundreds of rivers, there is room for greatness."" Openness and inclusiveness have created the grand stage of Geneva's multilateral diplomacy. We must promote the democratization of international relations, and we must not engage in ""one country's hegemony"" or ""co-governance by several parties."" The destiny of the world should be jointly controlled by all countries, international rules should be jointly written by all countries, global affairs should be jointly governed by all countries, and development results should be shared by all countries. , In 1862, Mr. Henry Du Nan asked in ""Memories of Shafirillo"": Can a humanitarian organization be established? Can a humanitarian convention be formulated? ""Question of Du Nan"" soon got the answer. The following year, the ICRC came into being. After more than 150 years of development, the Red Cross has become a spirit and a banner. In the face of frequent humanitarian crises, we should promote the spirit of humanity, fraternity, and dedication, and send care and hope to innocent people in trouble; we should uphold the basic principles of neutrality, fairness, and independence, and avoid humanitarian problems. Politicized and insisted on the demilitarization of humanitarian assistance. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , The road is simple, hard work is essential. The key to building a community of human destiny is action. I believe that the international community should make efforts in partnership, security pattern, economic development, civilization exchanges, and ecological construction. —— Insist on dialogue and consultation and build a world of lasting peace. If the country is in peace, the world will be safe. From the Peloponnesian War in BC to the two world wars, to the Cold War that lasted more than 40 years, the lesson was painful and profound. ""Forget the past, the teacher of the future."" Our predecessors established the United Nations and won the world more than 70 years of relative peace. We need to improve mechanisms and means to better resolve disputes and contradictions and eliminate wars and conflicts. , Swiss writer and Nobel Prize winner Hesse said: ""We should not serve war and destruction, but should serve peace and understanding."" Countries should build a dialogue without confrontation, partnership and alliance. Powerful countries should respect each other's core interests and major concerns, manage contradictions and differences, and strive to build a new type of relationship without conflict, confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation. As long as we maintain communication and get along in good faith, the ""Thucydides trap"" can be avoided. Big nations should treat small nations as equals, and do not engage in hegemony that only respects oneself, buys and sells. No country can wage war at will, destroy the international rule of law, and cannot open Pandora’s box. Nuclear weapons are the ""swords of Damocles"" hanging over humans. They should be completely banned and eventually completely destroyed to achieve a nuclear-free world. We must uphold the principles of peace, sovereignty, inclusiveness, and co-governance, and build the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, the Internet, and other fields into the Xinjiang region where all parties cooperate, rather than an arena for mutual games. , ——Insist on building and sharing together to build a generally safe world There is no absolute safe haven in the world. The security of one country cannot be built on the turmoil of other countries. The threats of other countries may also become challenges for their own countries. Neighbors had problems. They shouldn't just think about fixing their own fences, but should help. ""Single is easy to break, but the public is indestructible."" All parties should establish a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. In recent years, terrorist attacks in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East have shown once again that terrorism is a public enemy of humanity. Anti-terrorism is a common obligation of all countries. It should not only cure the symptoms, but also cure the root causes. It is necessary to strengthen coordination, establish a global counter-terrorism united front, and build a safety umbrella for people of all countries. At present, the number of refugees has set a historical record since the end of the Second World War. The crisis needs to be dealt with, and the root cause is worth pondering. If it weren't for a homeless person, who would be displaced? The United Nations Refugee Agency, the International Organization for Migration, etc. should play a coordinating role and mobilize global forces to effectively respond. China has decided to provide 200 million yuan in new humanitarian aid to help Syrian refugees and displaced persons. terrorism,Global forces respond effectively. China has decided to provide 200 million yuan in new humanitarian aid to help Syrian refugees and displaced persons. Terrorism, refugee crisis and other issues are closely related to geopolitical conflicts, and conflict resolution is the fundamental strategy. The parties concerned should negotiate and negotiate, and other parties should actively persuade peace and promote talks, and respect the role of the United Nations as the main channel of good offices. Avian influenza, Ebola, Zika and other epidemics have continuously sounded the alarm for international health security. The World Health Organization should play a leading role in strengthening epidemic surveillance, information communication, experience exchange, and technology sharing. The international community should increase its support and assistance to the health undertakings of developing countries such as Africa. , ——Insist on win-win cooperation and build a common prosperous world. Development is the first priority and it applies to all countries. Countries should work together in the same boat, not neighbors. Countries, especially major economies, should strengthen macro-policy coordination, take into account the current and long-term perspective, and focus on solving deep-seated problems. It is necessary to seize the historic opportunity of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, change the mode of economic development, adhere to the innovation drive, and further develop social productivity and release social creativity. We must maintain the rules of the World Trade Organization, support an open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, and build an open world economy. If you engage in trade protectionism and paint the land as a prison, it will harm others and hurt you. Economic globalization is a historical trend that has contributed to the great prosperity of trade, the convenience of investment, the flow of people, and the development of technology. Since the beginning of this century, under the leadership of the United Nations and with the aid of economic globalization, the international community has formulated and implemented the Millennium Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, promoting 1.1 billion people out of poverty, 1.9 billion people having access to safe drinking water, and 3.5 billion people using Internet access, etc., will also achieve zero poverty in 2030. This fully shows that the general direction of economic globalization is correct. Of course, problems such as development imbalances, governance dilemmas, the digital divide, and fair deficits also exist objectively. These are the problems in progress. We have to face them and try to solve them, but we should not waste our food because of choking. , We must draw wisdom from history. Historians have long asserted that rapid economic development necessitates social change, economic development is easily supported, and social change is often resisted. We must not hesitate to move forward, but must move forward. We also have to find answers from reality. The international financial crisis that broke out in 2008 enlightens us that to guide the healthy development of economic globalization, we need to strengthen coordination and improve governance, and promote the establishment of an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, and win-win economic globalization. We must divide the cake and focus on solving the problem of fairness and justice. In September last year, the G20 Hangzhou Summit focused on major issues such as global economic governance. Through the ""Innovation Growth Blueprint"", development issues were included in the global macro policy framework for the first time and an action plan was formulated. ——Insist on exchanges and mutual learning, and build an open and inclusive world. ""The beauty of harmony is in difference."" The diversity of human civilization is the basic feature of the world and the source of human progress. There are more than 200 countries and regions, more than 2,500 ethnic groups and multiple religions in the world. Different history and national conditions, different nationalities and customs have bred different civilizations and made the world more colorful. Civilization has no distinction between superiority and inferiority, only features and regions. Civilization differences should not be the source of world conflicts, but should be the driving force behind the progress of human civilization. Each civilization has its own unique charm and profound heritage, and is a spiritual treasure of mankind. Different civilizations should learn from each other's strengths and make progress together, so that civilization exchanges and mutual learning can become the driving force for the progress of human society and the link to maintain world peace. , —— Adhere to green and low-carbon, and build a clean and beautiful world. Man and nature coexist and coexist, and harming nature will eventually harm humanity. Natural resources such as air, water, soil and blue sky are unconsciously used and unsustainable. Industrialization has created unprecedented material wealth and also produced irreparable ecological trauma. We can't eat ancestors' meals, cut off roads for future generations, and engage in destructive development. Green water and green hills are Jinshan and Yinshan. We should follow the concept of the unity of heaven and man, and the nature of Tao and law, and seek the road of sustainable development. , We must advocate green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable production and lifestyle, balance and advance the 2030 sustainable development agenda, and constantly open up a civilized development path of production development, affluent life and good ecology. The conclusion of the Paris Agreement is a milestone in the history of global climate governance. We cannot let this achievement go to waste. All parties should jointly promote the implementation of the agreement. China will continue to take action to deal with climate change and undertake its obligations 100%. The Swiss Army Knife is a product of the Swiss ""artisan spirit"". When I first got a Swiss army knife, I admired people for giving it such versatility. I think it would be nice if we could build an exquisite Swiss army knife for our world.People can make it so versatile. I think it would be nice if we could build an exquisite Swiss army knife for our world. If humans encounter any problems, we will use one of these tools to solve it. I believe that as long as the international community makes unremitting efforts, such a Swiss army knife can be created. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! , Chinese people always believe that the world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better. Facing the future, many people are concerned about the direction of China's policies, and the international community also has a lot of discussion. Here, I give you a clear answer. First, China’s determination to maintain world peace will not change. The Chinese civilization has always advocated ""peace with the country"", ""peace is different"", and ""peace is precious"". China's ""Sun Tzu Art of War"" is a famous military book, but its first sentence says: ""The soldiers, the country's major events, the land of life and death, and the way of life and death, must not be ignored."" The essence is to fight carefully and not fight. For thousands of years, peace has been integrated into the blood of the Chinese nation and carved into the genes of the Chinese people. Hundreds of years ago, even when China became strong until its GDP accounted for 30% of the world, it had never invaded and expanded abroad. In the more than 100 years after the Opium War in 1840, China was frequently subjected to aggression and ravages, suffering from war disasters and turmoil. Confucius said, do not do what you don't want to do to others. The Chinese people are convinced that only peace and peace can prosper and develop. China has developed from a poor and weak country into the world's second-largest economy, not relying on foreign military expansion and colonial plunder, but on the hard work of the people and the maintenance of peace. China will always follow the path of peaceful development. No matter what step China develops, China will never seek hegemony, never expand, and never seek sphere of influence. History has proven and will continue to prove this. Second, China's determination to promote common development will not change. There is an old saying in China called ""Let's actually think about the tree and drink its source"". China's development has benefited from the international community, and China has also contributed to global development. China will continue to pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, share its own development opportunities with other countries in the world, and welcome all countries to take the ""smooth car"" of China's development. , From 1950 to 2016, China has provided more than 400 billion yuan in foreign aid. In the future, it will continue to increase foreign aid within its ability. Since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, China’s economic growth has contributed more than 30% annually to world economic growth. In the next five years, China will import US$8 trillion in commodities and absorb US$600 billion in foreign investment. China’s total foreign investment will reach US$750 billion and outbound tourism will reach 700 million. This will bring more opportunities for the development of all countries in the world. , China adheres to the development path that suits its national conditions, always puts the rights of the people first, and continuously promotes and protects human rights. China has solved the problem of food and clothing for more than 1.3 billion people and lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty. This is a major contribution to the cause of human rights in the world. , I propose the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, which is to achieve win-win and shared development. At present, more than 100 countries and international organizations have actively responded to support, and a large number of early harvest projects have landed and blossomed. China supports the construction of new types of multilateral financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to provide more public products to the international community. Third, China’s determination to build partnerships will not change. China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and develops friendly cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has taken the lead in establishing partnership as the guiding principle for exchanges between countries, and has established different forms of partnership with more than 90 countries and regional organizations. China will further connect ""friend circles"" all over the world. , China will strive to build an overall stable and balanced development framework for major power relations, actively develop new major power relations with the United States, develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with Russia, develop peace, growth, reform, and civilized partnership with Europe, and develop with BRICS countries. A partnership of solidarity and cooperation. China will continue to adhere to the correct view of righteousness and benefit, deepen pragmatic cooperation with developing countries, and achieve the same breath, common destiny, and development. China will deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries in accordance with the concept of sincerity and fraternity, uphold the true and sincere policy concept of Africa and seek common development with African countries, and promote the development of China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership. Fourth, China’s determination to support multilateralism will not change. Multilateralism is an effective way to maintain peace and promote development. For a long time, the United Nations and other international agencies have done a lot of work and made a visible contribution to maintaining the overall peace and sustainable development of the world. China is a founding member of the United Nations and the first country to sign on the Charter of the United Nations. China will firmly maintain the international system with the United Nations at its core, the basic principles of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and the authority and status of the United Nations.As the core international system, we firmly uphold the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, firmly uphold the authority and status of the United Nations, and the core role of the United Nations in international affairs. , China-United Nations Peace and Development Fund has been officially put into operation, China will give priority to the funds for peace and development projects proposed by the United Nations and relevant international agencies in Geneva. As China continues to develop, China's support for multilateralism will also increase. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! For China, Geneva has a special memory and emotion. In 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai headed a delegation to attend the Geneva conference to discuss with the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France a political solution to the North Korean issue and the Indo-China Armistice issue, show the spirit of peace, and contribute Chinese wisdom to world peace. In 1971, after resuming its legal seat in the United Nations and returning to the Geneva International Organization, China gradually participated in various fields of disarmament, economic and trade, human rights, and society, and provided a Chinese plan for the resolution of major issues and the formulation of important rules. In recent years, China has actively participated in dialogues and negotiations on hot issues such as Iran’s nuclear and Syrian issues, and has made Chinese contributions to promoting a political settlement. China has successfully applied to the International Olympic Committee for the summer and winter Olympics and Paralympics. More than 10 applications for China’s world natural heritage and cultural and natural dual heritage have been supported by the World Conservation Union, showing China’s splendor. , Ladies, gentlemen, friends! The ancient Chinese said: ""Good scholars do their best, and good walkers do their best."" Building a community of human destiny is a beautiful goal, and it is also a goal that requires generation after generation of relay runs. China is willing to work with member states, international organizations and institutions to jointly promote the great process of building a community of shared future for mankind. On January 28th, the Chinese people will usher in the Chinese New Year Dingyou New Year, which is the Spring Festival of the Year of the Rooster. The Year of the Rooster means bright and auspicious. ""Golden Rooster sings Thousand Doors."" I wish you a happy Chinese New Year and all the best! , thank you all. , (Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 18), ""People's Daily"" (01 January 20, 02 edition),]",Xi Jinping: Building a community of shared future for mankind,6648,来源：人民网－人民日报          发布时间：2017-01-20,"[, 尊敬的联合国大会主席汤姆森先生，, 尊敬的联合国秘书长古特雷斯先生，, 尊敬的联合国日内瓦总部总干事穆勒先生，, 女士们，先生们，朋友们：, 一元复始，万象更新。很高兴在新年伊始就来到联合国日内瓦总部，同大家一起探讨构建人类命运共同体这一时代命题。, 我刚刚出席了世界经济论坛年会。在达沃斯，各方在发言中普遍谈到，当今世界充满不确定性，人们对未来既寄予期待又感到困惑。世界怎么了、我们怎么办？这是整个世界都在思考的问题，也是我一直在思考的问题。, 我认为，回答这个问题，首先要弄清楚一个最基本的问题，就是我们从哪里来、现在在哪里、将到哪里去？, 回首最近100多年的历史，人类经历了血腥的热战、冰冷的冷战，也取得了惊人的发展、巨大的进步。上世纪上半叶以前，人类遭受了两次世界大战的劫难，那一代人最迫切的愿望，就是免 于战争、缔造和平。上世纪五六十年代，殖民地人民普遍觉醒，他们最强劲的呼声，就是摆脱枷锁、争取独立。冷战结束后，各方最殷切的诉求，就是扩大合作、共同发展。, 这100多年全人类的共同愿望，就是和平与发展。然而，这项任务至今远远没有完成。我们要顺应人民呼声，接过历史接力棒，继续在和平与发展的马拉松跑道上奋勇向前。, 人类正处在大发展大变革大调整时期。世界多极化、经济全球化深入发展，社会信息化、文化多样化持续推进，新一轮科技革命和产业革命正在孕育成长，各国相互联系、相互依存，全球命运与共、休戚相关，和平力量的上升远远超过战争因素的增长，和平、发展、合作、共赢的时代潮流更加强劲。, 同时，人类也正处在一个挑战层出不穷、风险日益增多的时代。世界经济增长乏力，金融危机阴云不散，发展鸿沟日益突出，兵戎相见时有发生，冷战思维和强权政治阴魂不散，恐怖主义、难民危机、重大传染性疾病、气候变化等非传统安全威胁持续蔓延。, 宇宙只有一个地球，人类共有一个家园。霍金先生提出关于“平行宇宙”的猜想，希望在地球之外找到第二个人类得以安身立命的星球。这个愿望什么时候才能实现还是个未知数。到目前为止，地球是人类唯一赖以生存的家园，珍爱和呵护地球是人类的唯一选择。瑞士联邦大厦穹顶上刻着拉丁文铭文“人人为我，我为人人”。我们要为当代人着想，还要为子孙后代负责。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 让和平的薪火代代相传，让发展的动力源源不断，让文明的光芒熠熠生辉，是各国人民的期待，也是我们这一代政治家应有的担当。中国方案是：构建人类命运共同体，实现共赢共享。, 理念引领行动，方向决定出路。纵观近代以来的历史，建立公正合理的国际秩序是人类孜孜以求的目标。从360多年前《威斯特伐利亚和约》确立的平等和主权原则，到150多年前日内瓦公约确立的国际人道主义精神；从70多年前联合国宪章明确的四大宗旨和七项原则，到60多年前万隆会议倡导的和平共处五项原则，国际关系演变积累了一系列公认的原则。这些原则应该成为构建人类命运共同体的基本遵循。, 主权平等，是数百年来国与国规范彼此关系最重要的准则，也是联合国及所有机构、组织共同遵循的首要原则。主权平等，真谛在于国家不分大小、强弱、贫富，主权和尊严必须得到尊重，内政不容干涉，都有权自主选择社会制度和发展道路。在联合国、世界贸易组织、世界卫生组织、世界知识产权组织、世界气象组织、国际电信联盟、万国邮政联盟、国际移民组织、国际劳工组织等机构，各国平等参与决策，构成了完善全球治理的重要力量。新形势下，我们要坚持主权平等，推动各国权利平等、机会平等、规则平等。, 日内瓦见证了印度支那和平问题最后宣言的通过，见证了冷战期间两大对峙阵营国家领导人首次和解会议，见证了伊朗核、叙利亚等热点问题对话和谈判。历史和现实给我们的启迪是：沟通协商是化解分歧的有效之策，政治谈判是解决冲突的根本之道。只要怀有真诚愿望，秉持足够善意，展现政治智慧，再大的冲突都能化解，再厚的坚冰都能打破。, “法者，治之端也”。在日内瓦，各国以联合国宪章为基础，就政治安全、贸易发展、社会人权、科技卫生、劳工产权、文化体育等领域达成了一系列国际公约和法律文书。法律的生命在于付诸实施，各国有责任维护国际法治权威，依法行使权利，善意履行义务。法律的生命也在于公平正义，各国和国际司法机构应该确保国际法平等统一适用，不能搞双重标准，不能“合则用、不合则弃”，真正做到“无偏无党，王道荡荡”。, “海纳百川，有容乃大。”开放包容，筑就了日内瓦多边外交大舞台。我们要推进国际关系民主化，不能搞“一国独霸”或“几方共治”。世界命运应该由各国共同掌握，国际规则应该由各国共同书写，全球事务应该由各国共同治理，发展成果应该由各国共同分享。, 1862年，亨利·杜楠先生在《沙斐利洛的回忆》中追问：能否成立人道主义组织？能否制定人道主义公约？“杜楠之问”很快有了答案，次年，红十字国际委员会应运而生。经过150多年发展，红十字成为一种精神、一面旗帜。面对频发的人道主义危机，我们应该弘扬人道、博爱、奉献的精神，为身陷困境的无辜百姓送去关爱，送去希望；应该秉承中立、公正、独立的基本原则，避免人道主义问题政治化，坚持人道主义援助非军事化。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 大道至简，实干为要。构建人类命运共同体，关键在行动。我认为，国际社会要从伙伴关系、安全格局、经济发展、文明交流、生态建设等方面作出努力。, ——坚持对话协商，建设一个持久和平的世界。国家和，则世界安；国家斗，则世界乱。从公元前的伯罗奔尼撒战争到两次世界大战，再到延续40余年的冷战，教训惨痛而深刻。“前事不忘，后事之师。”我们的先辈建立了联合国，为世界赢得70余年相对和平。我们要完善机制和手段，更好化解纷争和矛盾、消弭战乱和冲突。, 瑞士作家、诺贝尔文学奖获得者黑塞说：“不应为战争和毁灭效劳，而应为和平与谅解服务。”国家之间要构建对话不对抗、结伴不结盟的伙伴关系。大国要尊重彼此核心利益和重大关切，管控矛盾分歧，努力构建不冲突不对抗、相互尊重、合作共赢的新型关系。只要坚持沟通、真诚相处，“修昔底德陷阱”就可以避免。大国对小国要平等相待，不搞唯我独尊、强买强卖的霸道。任何国家都不能随意发动战争，不能破坏国际法治，不能打开潘多拉的盒子。核武器是悬在人类头上的“达摩克利斯之剑”，应该全面禁止并最终彻底销毁，实现无核世界。要秉持和平、主权、普惠、共治原则，把深海、极地、外空、互联网等领域打造成各方合作的新疆域，而不是相互博弈的竞技场。, ——坚持共建共享，建设一个普遍安全的世界。世上没有绝对安全的世外桃源，一国的安全不能建立在别国的动荡之上，他国的威胁也可能成为本国的挑战。邻居出了问题，不能光想着扎好自家篱笆，而应该去帮一把。“单则易折，众则难摧。”各方应该树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的安全观。, 近年来，在欧洲、北非、中东发生的恐怖袭击事件再次表明，恐怖主义是人类公敌。反恐是各国共同义务，既要治标，更要治本。要加强协调，建立全球反恐统一战线，为各国人民撑起安全伞。当前，难民数量已经创下第二次世界大战结束以来的历史纪录。危机需要应对，根源值得深思。如果不是有家难归，谁会颠沛流离？联合国难民署、国际移民组织等要发挥统筹协调作用，动员全球力量有效应对。中国决定提供2亿元人民币新的人道援助，用于帮助叙利亚难民和流离失所者。恐怖主义、难民危机等问题都同地缘冲突密切相关，化解冲突是根本之策。当事各方要通过协商谈判，其他各方应该积极劝和促谈，尊重联合国发挥斡旋主渠道作用。禽流感、埃博拉、寨卡等疫情不断给国际卫生安全敲响警钟。世界卫生组织要发挥引领作用，加强疫情监测、信息沟通、经验交流、技术分享。国际社会应该加大对非洲等发展中国家卫生事业的支持和援助。, ——坚持合作共赢，建设一个共同繁荣的世界。发展是第一要务，适用于各国。各国要同舟共济，而不是以邻为壑。各国特别是主要经济体要加强宏观政策协调，兼顾当前和长远，着力解决深层次问题。要抓住新一轮科技革命和产业变革的历史性机遇，转变经济发展方式，坚持创新驱动，进一步发展社会生产力、释放社会创造力。要维护世界贸易组织规则，支持开放、透明、包容、非歧视性的多边贸易体制，构建开放型世界经济。如果搞贸易保护主义、画地为牢，损人不利己。, 经济全球化是历史大势，促成了贸易大繁荣、投资大便利、人员大流动、技术大发展。本世纪初以来，在联合国主导下，借助经济全球化，国际社会制定和实施了千年发展目标和2030年可持续发展议程，推动11亿人口脱贫，19亿人口获得安全饮用水，35亿人口用上互联网等，还将在2030年实现零贫困。这充分说明，经济全球化的大方向是正确的。当然，发展失衡、治理困境、数字鸿沟、公平赤字等问题也客观存在。这些是前进中的问题，我们要正视并设法解决，但不能因噎废食。, 我们要从历史中汲取智慧。历史学家早就断言，经济快速发展使社会变革成为必需，经济发展易获支持，而社会变革常遭抵制。我们不能因此踟蹰不前，而要砥砺前行。我们也要从现实中寻找答案。2008年爆发的国际金融危机启示我们，引导经济全球化健康发展，需要加强协调、完善治理，推动建设一个开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的经济全球化，既要做大蛋糕，更要分好蛋糕，着力解决公平公正问题。, 去年9月，二十国集团领导人杭州峰会聚焦全球经济治理等重大问题，通过《创新增长蓝图》，首次将发展问题纳入全球宏观政策框架，并制定了行动计划。, ——坚持交流互鉴，建设一个开放包容的世界。“和羹之美，在于合异。”人类文明多样性是世界的基本特征，也是人类进步的源泉。世界上有200多个国家和地区、2500多个民族、多种宗教。不同历史和国情，不同民族和习俗，孕育了不同文明，使世界更加丰富多彩。文明没有高下、优劣之分，只有特色、地域之别。文明差异不应该成为世界冲突的根源，而应该成为人类文明进步的动力。, 每种文明都有其独特魅力和深厚底蕴，都是人类的精神瑰宝。不同文明要取长补短、共同进步，让文明交流互鉴成为推动人类社会进步的动力、维护世界和平的纽带。, ——坚持绿色低碳，建设一个清洁美丽的世界。人与自然共生共存，伤害自然最终将伤及人类。空气、水、土壤、蓝天等自然资源用之不觉、失之难续。工业化创造了前所未有的物质财富，也产生了难以弥补的生态创伤。我们不能吃祖宗饭、断子孙路，用破坏性方式搞发展。绿水青山就是金山银山。我们应该遵循天人合一、道法自然的理念，寻求永续发展之路。, 我们要倡导绿色、低碳、循环、可持续的生产生活方式，平衡推进2030年可持续发展议程，不断开拓生产发展、生活富裕、生态良好的文明发展道路。《巴黎协定》的达成是全球气候治理史上的里程碑。我们不能让这一成果付诸东流。各方要共同推动协定实施。中国将继续采取行动应对气候变化，百分之百承担自己的义务。, 瑞士军刀是瑞士“工匠精神”的产物。我第一次得到一把瑞士军刀时，我就很佩服人们能赋予它那么多功能。我想，如果我们能为我们这个世界打造一把精巧的瑞士军刀就好了，人类遇到了什么问题，就用其中一个工具来解决它。我相信，只要国际社会不懈努力，这样一把瑞士军刀是可以打造出来的。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国人始终认为，世界好，中国才能好；中国好，世界才更好。面向未来，很多人关心中国的政策走向，国际社会也有很多议论。在这里，我给大家一个明确的回答。, 第一，中国维护世界和平的决心不会改变。中华文明历来崇尚“以和邦国”、“和而不同”、“以和为贵”。中国《孙子兵法》是一部著名兵书，但其第一句话就讲：“兵者，国之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也”，其要义是慎战、不战。几千年来，和平融入了中华民族的血脉中，刻进了中国人民的基因里。, 数百年前，即使中国强盛到国内生产总值占世界30%的时候，也从未对外侵略扩张。1840年鸦片战争后的100多年里，中国频遭侵略和蹂躏之害，饱受战祸和动乱之苦。孔子说，己所不欲，勿施于人。中国人民深信，只有和平安宁才能繁荣发展。, 中国从一个积贫积弱的国家发展成为世界第二大经济体，靠的不是对外军事扩张和殖民掠夺，而是人民勤劳、维护和平。中国将始终不渝走和平发展道路。无论中国发展到哪一步，中国永不称霸、永不扩张、永不谋求势力范围。历史已经并将继续证明这一点。, 第二，中国促进共同发展的决心不会改变。中国有句古语叫“落其实思其树，饮其流怀其源”。中国发展得益于国际社会，中国也为全球发展作出了贡献。中国将继续奉行互利共赢的开放战略，将自身发展机遇同世界各国分享，欢迎各国搭乘中国发展的“顺风车”。, 1950年至2016年，中国累计对外提供援款4000多亿元人民币，今后将继续在力所能及的范围内加大对外帮扶。国际金融危机爆发以来，中国经济增长对世界经济增长的贡献率年均在30%以上。未来5年，中国将进口8万亿美元的商品，吸收6000亿美元的外来投资，中国对外投资总额将达到7500亿美元，出境旅游将达到7亿人次。这将为世界各国发展带来更多机遇。, 中国坚持走符合本国国情的发展道路，始终把人民权利放在首位，不断促进和保护人权。中国解决了13亿多人口的温饱问题，让7亿多人口摆脱贫困，这是对世界人权事业的重大贡献。, 我提出“一带一路”倡议，就是要实现共赢共享发展。目前，已经有100多个国家和国际组织积极响应支持，一大批早期收获项目落地开花。中国支持建设好亚洲基础设施投资银行等新型多边金融机构，为国际社会提供更多公共产品。, 第三，中国打造伙伴关系的决心不会改变。中国坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则基础上同所有国家发展友好合作。中国率先把建立伙伴关系确定为国家间交往的指导原则，同90多个国家和区域组织建立了不同形式的伙伴关系。中国将进一步联结遍布全球的“朋友圈”。, 中国将努力构建总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系框架，积极同美国发展新型大国关系，同俄罗斯发展全面战略协作伙伴关系，同欧洲发展和平、增长、改革、文明伙伴关系，同金砖国家发展团结合作的伙伴关系。中国将继续坚持正确义利观，深化同发展中国家务实合作，实现同呼吸、共命运、齐发展。中国将按照亲诚惠容理念同周边国家深化互利合作，秉持真实亲诚对非政策理念同非洲国家共谋发展，推动中拉全面合作伙伴关系实现新发展。, 第四，中国支持多边主义的决心不会改变。多边主义是维护和平、促进发展的有效路径。长期以来，联合国等国际机构做了大量工作，为维护世界总体和平、持续发展的态势作出了有目共睹的贡献。, 中国是联合国创始成员国，是第一个在联合国宪章上签字的国家。中国将坚定维护以联合国为核心的国际体系，坚定维护以联合国宪章宗旨和原则为基石的国际关系基本准则，坚定维护联合国权威和地位，坚定维护联合国在国际事务中的核心作用。, 中国—联合国和平与发展基金已经正式投入运营，中国将把资金优先用于联合国及日内瓦相关国际机构提出的和平与发展项目。随着中国持续发展，中国支持多边主义的力度也将越来越大。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 对中国来讲，日内瓦具有一份特殊的记忆和情感。1954年，周恩来总理率团出席日内瓦会议，同苏联、美国、英国、法国等共同讨论政治解决朝鲜问题和印度支那停战问题，展现和平精神，为世界和平贡献了中国智慧。1971年，中国恢复在联合国的合法席位、重返日内瓦国际机构后，逐步参与裁军、经贸、人权、社会等各领域事务，为重大问题解决和重要规则制定提供了中国方案。近年来，中国积极参与伊朗核、叙利亚等热点问题的对话和谈判，为推动政治解决作出了中国贡献。中国先后成功向国际奥委会申办夏季和冬季两届奥运会和残奥会，中国10多项世界自然遗产和文化自然双重遗产申请得到世界自然保护联盟支持，呈现了中国精彩。, 女士们、先生们、朋友们！, 中国古人说：“善学者尽其理，善行者究其难。”构建人类命运共同体是一个美好的目标，也是一个需要一代又一代人接力跑才能实现的目标。中国愿同广大成员国、国际组织和机构一道，共同推进构建人类命运共同体的伟大进程。, 1月28日，中国人民将迎来农历丁酉新年，也就是鸡年春节。鸡年寓意光明和吉祥。“金鸡一唱千门晓。”我祝大家新春快乐、万事如意！, 谢谢大家。,
